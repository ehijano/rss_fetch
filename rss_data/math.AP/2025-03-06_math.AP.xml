      <title>Estimates for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation linearized around a vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linearized two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation around a vortex of degree one, with data in the same equivariance class. Various estimates are proved for the solution; in particular, conditions for optimal decay in $L^\infty$ and boundedness in $L^2$ are identified. The analysis relies on a full description of the spectral resolution of the linearized operator through the associated distorted Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>A class of anisotropic diffusion-transport equations in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Einstein's probabilistic method for the Brownian motion to study compressible fluids in porous media. The multi-dimensional case is considered with general probability distribution functions. By relating the expected displacement per unit time with the velocity of the fluid, we derive an anisotropic diffusion equation in non-divergence form that contains a transport term. Under the Darcy law assumption, a corresponding nonlinear partial differential equations for the density function is obtained. The classical solutions of this equation are studied, and the maximum and strong maximum principles are established. We also obtain exponential decay estimates for the solutions for all time, and particularly, their exponential convergence as time tends to infinity. Our analysis uses some transformations of the Bernstein-Cole--Hopf type which are explicitly constructed even for very general equation of state. Moreover, the Lemma of Growth in time is proved and utilized in order to achieve the above decaying estimates.</description>

      <title>Global perturbation of isolated equivariant chiral skyrmions from the harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated skyrmion solutions to the 2D Landau-Lifshitz equation with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Zeeman interaction, and easy-plane anisotropy are considered. In a wide range of parameters illustrating the various interaction strengths, we construct exact solutions and examine their monotonicity, exponential decay, and stability using a careful mathematical analysis. We also estimate the distance between the constructed solutions and the harmonic maps by exploiting the structure of the linearized equation and by proving a resolvent estimate for the linearized operator that is uniform in extra implicit potentials.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a system coupled by nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Allen-Cahn equations describing a diffuse interface for two-phase flow of viscous fluids with different densities in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d (d=2, 3)$. The mobility is allowed to depend on phase variable but non-degenerate. We first prove the existence of global weak solutions to the initial boundary value problem in 2D and 3D cases. Then we obtain the existence of local in time strong solutions in 3D case as well as the global strong solutions in 2D case. Moreover, by imposing smallness conditions on the initial data, the 3D local in time strong solution is extended globally, with an exponential decay rate for perturbations. At last, we show the weak-strong uniqueness.</description>

      <title>A parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation with quasilinear degenerate diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local and global well-posedness, along with finite time blow-up, are investigated for the following Hardy-H\'enon equation involving a quasilinear degenerate diffusion and a space-dependent superlinear source featuring a singular potential $$\partial_t u=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p,\quad t&gt;0,\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N,$$ when $m&gt;1$, $p&gt;1$ and $\sigma\in \big(\max\{-2,-N\},0 \big)$. While the superlinear source induces finite time blow-up when $\sigma=0$, whatever the value of $p&gt;1$, at least for sufficiently large initial conditions, a striking effect of the singular potential $|x|^\sigma$ is the prevention of finite time blow-up for suitably small values of $p$, namely, $1&lt;p\le p_G := [2-\sigma(m-1)]/2$. Such a result, as well as the local existence of solutions for $p&gt;p_G$, is obtained by employing the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities. Another interesting feature is that uniqueness and comparison principle hold true for generic non-negative initial conditions when $p&gt;p_G$, but their validity is restricted to initial conditions which are positive in a neighborhood of $x=0$ when $p\in (1,p_G)$, a range in which non-uniqueness holds true without this positivity condition. Finite time blow-up of any non-trivial, non-negative solution is established when $p_G&lt;p\leq p_F:=m+(\sigma+2)/N$, while global existence for small initial data in some critical Lebesgue spaces and blow-up in finite time for initial data with a negative energy are proved for $p&gt;p_F$. Optimal temporal growth rates are also derived for global solutions when $p\in (1,p_G]$. All the results are sharp with respect to the exponents $(m,p,\sigma)$ and conditions on $u_0$.</description>

      <title>B\^ocher type theorem for elliptic equations with drift perturbed L\'evy operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical B\^ocher's theorem asserts that any positive harmonic function (with respect to the Laplacian) in the punctured unit ball can be expressed, up to the multiplication constant, as the sum of the Newtonian kernel and a positive function that is harmonic in the whole unit ball. This theorem expresses one of the fundamental results in the theory of isolated singularities and it can be viewed as a statement on the asymptotic behavior of positive harmonic functions near their isolated singularities. In the paper we generalize this results to drift perturbed L\'evy operators. We propose a new approach based on the probabilistic potential theory. It applies to L\'evy operators for which the resolvent of its perturbation is strongly Feller. In particular our result encompasses drift perturbed fractional Laplacians with any stability index bounded between zero and two - the method therefore applies to subcritical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <title>Supersonic flow of Chaplygin gases past a conical body with diamond-cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mathematical aspects of supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical body with diamond-shaped cross sections. The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. In conical coordinates, the problem can be reformulated as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation. By establishing a crucial Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain that is strictly away from the degenerate boundary. Using this property, we finally prove the unique existence of a solution to this problem via the method of continuity, provided that the apex angle of the conical body is less than a critical angle determined by the oncoming flow.</description>

      <title>A semi-adaptive finite difference method for simulating two-sided fractional convection-diffusion quenching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quenching solutions of an one-dimensional, two-sided Riemann-Liouville fractional order convection-diffusion problem. Fractional order spatial derivatives are discretized using weighted averaging approximations in conjunction with standard and shifted Gr\"{u}nwald formulas. The advective term is handled utilizing a straightforward Euler formula, resulting in a semi-discretized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The conservativeness of the proposed scheme is rigorously proved and validated through simulation experiments. The study is further advanced to a fully discretized, semi-adaptive finite difference method. Detailed analysis is implemented for the monotonicity, positivity and stability of the scheme. Investigations are carried out to assess the potential impacts of the fractional order on quenching location, quenching time, and critical length. The computational results are thoroughly discussed and analyzed, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the quenching phenomena modeled through two-sided fractional order convection-diffusion problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the least action principle, this paper provides new admissibility criteria for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. In the case of the Riemann initial value problem for the isentropic compressible Euler equations we show the criteria prefer the classical 2-shock solution to solutions generated by convex integration and to recently constructed hybrid solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study minimizing cones in the Alt-Phillips problem when the exponent {\gamma} is close to 1.
  When {\gamma} converges to 1, we show that the cones concentrate around symmetric solutions to the classical obstacle problem. To be precise, the limiting profiles are radial in a subspace and invariant in directions perpendicular to that subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for frequency-dependent damping in the linear wave equation. After proving well-posedness of the problem, we study qualitative properties of the energy. In the one-dimensional case, we provide an explicit analysis for special choices of the damping operator. Finally, we show, in special cases, that solutions split into a dissipative and a conservative part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the space-time analyticity of global solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with small initial data in critical \emph{Besov} spaces $\dot B^{3/p-1}_{p,q}$. Time decay rates of higher order space-time joint derivatives and instantaneous lower bounds of the analyticity radius follow as straightforward consequences. The method employed combines Gevrey-class estimates with iterative derivative techniques. Furthermore, we obtain a logarithmic improvement in the lower bound for the spatial analyticity radius of solutions for arbitrary initial data in critical \emph{Besov} spaces.</description>

      <title>A k-Hessian equation with a power nonlinearity source and self-similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of spherically symmetric solutions of S_k(D^2v)+beta xi\cdot\nabla v+\alpha v+\abs{v}^{q-1}v=0 in R^n, where \alpha,\beta are real parameters, n&gt;2,\, q&gt;k\geq 1 and S_k(D^2v) stands for the k-Hessian operator of v. Our results are based mainly on the analysis of an associated dynamical system and energy methods. We derive some properties of the solutions of the above equation for different ranges of the parameters \alpha and \beta. In particular, we describe with precision its asymptotic behavior at infinity. Further, according to the position of q with respect to the first critical exponent \frac{(n+2)k}{n} and the Tso critical exponent \frac{(n+2)k}{n-2k} we study the existence of three classes of solutions: crossing, slow decay or fast decay solutions. In particular, if k&gt;1 all the fast decay solutions have a compact support in R^n. The results also apply to construct self-similar solutions of type I to a related nonlinear evolution equation. These are self-similar functions of the form u(t,x)=t^{-\alpha}v(xt^{-\beta}) with suitable \alpha and \beta.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the gradient flow structure and the well-posedness of the Fokker-Planck equation on locally finite graphs. We first construct a 2-Wasserstein-type metric in the probability density space associated with the underlying graphs that are locally finite. Then, we prove the global existence and asymptotic behavior of the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation using a novel approach that differs significantly from the methods applied in the finite case, as proposed in [S., Chow, W., Huang, Y., Li, H., Zhou, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 2012]. This work seems the first result on the study of Wasserstein-type metrics and the Fokker-Planck equation in probability spaces defined on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>A mild rough Gronwall Lemma with applications to non-autonomous evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <title>Stability for the Surface Diffusion Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global existence and stability of surface diffusion flow (the normal velocity is given by the Laplacian of the mean curvature) of smooth boundaries of subsets of the $n$--dimensional flat torus. More precisely, we show that if a smooth set is ``close enough'' to a strictly stable critical set for the Area functional under a volume constraint, then the surface diffusion flow of its boundary hypersurface exists for all time and asymptotically converges to the boundary of a ``translated'' of the critical set. This result was obtained in dimension $n=3$ by Acerbi, Fusco, Julin and Morini (extending previous results for spheres of Escher, Mayer and Simonett and Elliott and Garcke in dimension $n=2$). Our work generalizes such conclusion to any dimension $n\in\mathbb N$. For sake of clarity, we show all the details in dimension $n=4$ and we list the necessary modifications to the quantities involved in the proof in the general $n$--dimensional case, in the last section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fifth-order KP II equation $$ \partial_t u + \alpha \partial_x^3 u + \beta \partial_x^5 u + u \partial_x u + \partial_x^{-1} \partial_y^2u=0$$ ($\beta&lt;0$, $\alpha&gt;0$) is a nonlinear dispersive equation that models long dispersive waves in two space dimensions. We prove that solutions of the fifth-order KP II equation scatter to solutions of the corresponding linear equation $$ \partial_t v + \alpha\partial_x^3 v + \beta\partial_x^5 v + \partial_x^{-1} \partial_y^2 v = 0$$ for small data. Our proof uses builds on Hadac, Herr, and Koch's work (see ArXiv:0708.2011) on the third-order KP II equation.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Solutions For Porous Medium Equations with Nonlocal L\'{e}vy-type Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a porous medium-type equation whose pressure is given by a nonlocal L\'{e}vy operator associated to a symmetric jump L\'{e}vy kernel. The class of nonlocal operators under consideration appears as a generalization of the classical fractional Laplace operator. For the class of L\'evy-operators, we construct weak solutions using a variational minimizing movement scheme. The lack of interpolation techniques is ensued by technical challenges that render our setting more challenging than the one known for fractional operators.</description>

      <title>Global existence for non-homogeneous incompressible inviscid fluids in presence of Ekman pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global solvability of the density-dependent incompressible Euler equations, supplemented with a damping term of the form $ \mathfrak{D}_{\alpha}^{\gamma}(\rho, u) = \alpha \rho^{\gamma} u $, where $\alpha&gt;0$ and $ \gamma \in \{0,1\} $. To some extent, this system can be seen as a simplified model describing the mean dynamics in the ocean; from this perspective, the damping term can be interpreted as a term encoding the effects of the celebrated Ekman pumping in the system.
  On the one hand, in the general case of space dimension $d\geq 2$, we establish global well-posedness in the Besov spaces framework, under a non-linear smallness condition involving the size of the initial velocity field $u_0$, of the initial non-homogeneity $\rho_0-1$ and of the damping coefficient $\alpha$. On the other hand, in the specific situation of planar motions and damping term with $\gamma=1$, we exhibit a second smallness condition implying global existence, which in particular yields global well-posedness for arbitrarily large initial velocity fields, provided the initial density variations $\rho_0-1$ are small enough. The formulated smallness conditions rely only on the endpoint Besov norm $B^1_{\infty,1}$ of the initial datum, whereas, as a byproduct of our analysis, we derive exponential decay of the velocity field and of the pressure gradient in the high regularity norms $B^s_{p,r}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce modified energies that are suitable to get upper bounds on the high Sobolev norms for solutions to the $1$D periodic NLS. Our strategy is rather flexible and allows us to get a new and simpler proof of the bounds obtained by Bourgain in the case of the quintic nonlinearity, as well as its extension to the case of higher order nonlinearities. Our main ingredients are a combination of integration by parts and classical dispersive estimates.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear elliptic equations with general drifts and $L^1$-zero-order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for linear elliptic equations in divergence form with $L^p$-general drifts, where $p \in (d, \infty)$, and non-negative $L^1$-zero-order terms. Specifically, by transforming the general drifts into weak divergence-free drifts, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a bounded weak solution, showing that the zero-order term does not influence the quantity of the unique weak solution. Additionally, by imposing the $ VMO$ condition and mild differentiability on the diffusion coefficients and assuming an $L^s$-zero-order terms with $s \in (1, \infty)$, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for the corresponding non-divergence type equations. An important feature of this paper is that, due to the weak divergence-free property of the drifts in the transformed equations, the constants appearing in our estimates can be explicitly calculated, which is expected to offer significant applications in error analysis.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions for the steady state of the Keller-Segel system on Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following Neumann boundary problem related to the stationary solutions of the Keller-Segel system, a basic model of chemotaxis phenomena: \[ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -\Delta_g u +\beta u =\lambda\left(\frac{Ve^u}{\int_{\Sigma} Ve^u d v_g}-1\right), &amp;\text { in } \mathring\Sigma\\ \partial_{ \nu_g} u=0, &amp;\text { on } \partial \Sigma \end{array} \right.,\] on a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ of unit area, with interior $\mathring\Sigma$ and smooth boundary $\partial \Sigma$. Here, $\Delta_g$ denote the Laplace-Beltrami operator, $dv_g$ the area element of $(\Sigma, g)$, and $\nu_g$ the unit outward normal to $\partial \Sigma$ and $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are non-negative parameters, $V$ is non-negative with finite zero set.
  For any integers $m&gt;0$ and $k,l\geq 0$ with $m=2k+l$, we establish a sufficient condition on $V$ for the existence of a sequence of blow-up solutions as $\lambda$ approaches the critical values $4\pi m$, which blows up at $k$ points in the interior and $l$ points on the boundary. Moreover, the study expands to the corresponding singular problem.</description>

      <title>On sharpened singular Adams' type inequalities and applications to $(p,\frac{n}{2})$-biharmonic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to establish a sharp version of Adams' type inequality in a suitable higher order function space with singular weight in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In addition, we also provide the proof of a sharp singular concentration-compactness principle due to Lions' as an improvement of this singular Adams' inequality. It is well known that such types of inequalities can be classified in two different ways, for instance, critical sharp singular Adams' type inequality (involving Sobolev full norm as constraint) and subcritical sharp singular Adams' type inequality (involving Sobolev partial norm as constraint). Further, we shall establish that critical and subcritical sharp singular Adams' type inequalities are surprisingly equivalent. To be more precisely, we also discuss about the asymptotic behavior of the lower and upper bounds of subcritical sharp singular Adams' type inequality and establish a relation between the suprema of such types of critical and subcritical sharp inequalities. Despite this, we shall demonstrate a new compact embedding, which plays a crucial role in our arguments. Moreover, as an application of these results, by employing the mountain pass theorem, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions to a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations involving $(p,\frac{n}{2})$-biharmonic operator with singular exponential growth as follows $$
  \Delta^2_p u+\Delta^2_{\frac{n}{2}} u=\frac{g(x,u)}{|x|^\gamma}\quad\text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n, $$ with $n\geq 4$, $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{2}$, $\gamma\in(0,n)$ and the nonlinear term $g:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a Carath\'eodory function, which behaves like $\exp{(\alpha|s|^{\frac{n}{n-2}})}$ as $|s|\to~+\infty$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the higher-dimensional $b$-equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The higher-dimensional $b$-equation is a family of PDEs, introduced by Holm and Staley (2003), that describe the motion of shallow water waves in $n$-dimensions. It expresses the invariance of the Lie-transport of the momentum one-form density associated with the fluid in $b$-dimensions. The constant $b$ can also be viewed as a balance parameter between fluid convection and fluid stretching/expansion. In this article, we interpret this family of PDEs as the geodesic equation of a right-invariant affine connection on the diffeomorphism group of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Using this framework and the methods of Ebin and Marsden (1970), we show local well-posedness of the $b$-equation with a Fourier multiplier as the inertia operator. This is achieved by formulating the $b$-equation as a smooth ODE on a Hilbert manifold, applying Picard-Lindel\"{o}f, and transferring back to the smooth category by showing that there is no loss of spatial regularity during the time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the radial symmetry, uniqueness and non-degeneracy of solutions to the degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\nabla \cdot \left(|x|^{2a} \nabla u\right) + \omega u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^d, $$ where $d \geq 2$, $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2d}{d-2(1-a)}$. We proved that any ground state is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing in the radial direction. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of ground states and derive the non-degeneracy of ground states in the corresponding radially symmetric Sobolev space. This affirms the nature conjectures posed recently in \cite{IS}.</description>

Abstract: We study the mean field limit for singular dynamics with time evolving weights. Our results are an extension of the work of Serfaty \cite{duerinckx2020mean} and Bresch-Jabin-Wang \cite{bresch2019modulated}, which consider singular Coulomb flows with weights which are constant time. The inclusion of time dependent weights necessitates the commutator estimates of \cite{duerinckx2020mean,bresch2019modulated}, as well as a new functional inequality. The well-posedness of the mean field PDE and the associated system of trajectories is also proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our proof relies on the full tree-structure characterization of the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of transporting one probability measure to another via an autonomous velocity field. We rely on tools from the theory of optimal transport. In one space-dimension, we solve a linear homogeneous functional equation to construct a suitable autonomous vector field that realizes the (unique) monotone transport map as the time-$1$ map of its flow. Generically, this vector field can be chosen to be Lipschitz continuous. We then use Sudakov's disintegration approach to deal with the multi-dimensional case by reducing it to a family of one-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>
