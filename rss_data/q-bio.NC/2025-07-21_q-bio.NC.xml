      <title>State Space Models Naturally Produce Traveling Waves, Time Cells, and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal learning in the brain.</description>

      <title>Convergent transformations of visual representation in brains and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.</description>

      <title>Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.</description>
