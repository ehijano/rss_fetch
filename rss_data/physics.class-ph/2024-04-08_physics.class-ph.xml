      <title>An Exact Invariant for Relativistic Linear Harmonic Oscillator with Time-dependent Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an exact invariant for a relativistic linear harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency. This is accomplished, following Eliezer and Gray \cite{EliezerGray}, for the non-relativistic case, by associating a relativistic plane isotropic harmonic oscillator with this problem. This exact invariant reflects the conservation of angular momentum of the associated relativistic plane isotropic oscillator. Departures in the physical interpretations of this exact invariant caused by relativistic effects are pointed out.</description>

      <title>A Lip Vibration Model Using Mechanical Properties of Flesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of the human lip between relaxed and fully contracted are not enough to explain the full range of professional brass players. Brass players manipulate their mouth cavity and vocal tract which act as Helmholtz resonators driving the lips. Brass players increase their upper ranges by reducing the amount of lip mass that vibrates using upstream or downstream techniques. In addition, it was found that the cup of the mouthpiece is a separate resonating cavity: not just an extension of the instrument funneling air down the length of tube. For the lowest three octaves of the range, the trombone does not act as a tube with a standing wave resonance, but as a transmission line responding to a string of pulses produced by the lips.</description>

      <title>PREDIS-MHI Thermal Data</title>

Abstract: The French Construction and Housing Code had set an obligation for tertiary buildings to reduce their final energy consumption by 40% in 2030, 50% in 2040, and 60% in 2050. According to ADEME, tertiary buildings in France account for almost a third of the energy consumed in the built environment. As such, buildings in this category could be an important lever to meet these goals necessitated by the energy transition. The availability of high-quality datasets from this sector will be a crucial enabler in meeting these goals by developing and testing new energy management approaches in the buildings. In this paper, we present the thermal energy datasets available and published online for the PREDIS-MHI zone of the GreEn-ER building, a tertiary building with more than a thousand sensors used for research, teaching, and administrative activities in Grenoble.</description>

      <title>Symmetry criteria for the equality of interior and exterior shape factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lienhard (2019) reported that the shape factor of the interior of a simply-connected region ($\Omega$) is equal to that of its exterior ($\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\Omega$) under the same boundary conditions. In that study, numerical examples supported the claim in particular cases; for example, it was shown that for certain boundary conditions on circles and squares, the conjecture holds. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture is not generally true, unless some additional condition is met. We proceed by elucidating why the conjecture does in fact hold in all of the examples analysed by Lienhard. We thus deduce a simple criterion which, when satisfied, ensures the equality of interior and exterior shape factors in general. Our criterion notably relies on a beautiful and little-known symmetry method due to Hersch (1982) which we introduce in a tutorial manner.</description>

      <title>A novel analysis method for calculating nonlinear Frequency Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are the most widely used functions to characterise the dynamic behaviour of structures. The natural frequencies and damping behaviour can be easily and quickly detected from a Bode diagram. The modal properties of FRFs can be evaluated using modal analysis methods, and as the last step, frequency response models can synthesise response functions to verify the robustness of the modal parameters identified by the analysis. The circularity between 1) measurement, 2) identification, 3) regeneration and 4) comparison is ensured on the assumption that transfer functions are measured under linear vibrations, even though mechanical systems are intrinsically non-linear. Some sources of nonlinearity might be excited and revealed, and others not for various reasons. Anyhow, it is unavoidable to measure non-linear vibrations when vibration tests are executed at various levels of excitation forces. Eventually, linear and non-linear vibrations are processed to obtain linear and non-linear FRFs. The linear FRFs are processed using the existing identification methods. The non-linear FRFs are archived or blandly processed to evaluate the level and the type of nonlinearity, such as hardening or softening behaviour. This research aims to (i) formulate a new analysis method to generate nonlinear frequency responses and (ii) formulate a new identification method for extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters. The first objective will demonstrate that a nonlinear frequency response surface generated by linear FRFs is the solution space of nonlinear FRFs. The second objective will demonstrate that a linear modal analysis method called line-fit, based on the Dobson formulation, allows extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters from non-linear FRFs.</description>

      <title>Analytical Modeling of Acoustic Exponential Materials and Physical Mechanism of Broadband Anti-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially exponential distributions of material properties are ubiquitous in many natural and engineered systems, from the vertical distribution of the atmosphere to acoustic horns and anti-reflective coatings. These media seamlessly interface different impedances, enhancing wave transmission and reducing internal reflections. This work advances traditional transfer matrix theory by integrating analytical solutions for acoustic exponential materials, which possess exponential density and/or bulk modulus, offering a more accurate predictive tool and revealing the physical mechanism of broadband anti-reflection for sound propagation in such non-uniform materials. Leveraging this method, we designed an acoustic dipole array that effectively mimics exponential mass distribution. Through experiments with precisely engineered micro-perforated plates, we demonstrate an ultra-low reflection rate of about 0.86% across a wide frequency range from 420 Hz to 10,000 Hz. Our modified transfer matrix approach underpins the design of exponential materials, and our layering strategy for stacking acoustic dipoles suggests a pathway to more functional gradient acoustic metamaterials.</description>
