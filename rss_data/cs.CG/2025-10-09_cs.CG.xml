      <title>Robust Geometric Predicates for Bivariate Computational Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theory and practice for robust implementations of bivariate Jacobi set and Reeb space algorithms. Robustness is a fundamental topic in computational geometry that deals with the issues of numerical errors and degenerate cases in algorithm implementations. Computational topology already uses some robustness techniques for the development of scalar field algorithms, such as those for computing critical points, merge trees, contour trees, Reeb graphs, Morse-Smale complexes, and persistent homology. In most cases, robustness can be ensured with floating-point arithmetic, and degenerate cases can be resolved with a standard symbolic perturbation technique called Simulation of Simplicity. However, this becomes much more complex for topological data structures of multifields, such as Jacobi sets and Reeb spaces. The geometric predicates used in their computation require exact arithmetic and a more involved treatment of degenerate cases to ensure correctness. Neither of these challenges has been fully addressed in the literature so far. In this paper, we describe how exact arithmetic and symbolic perturbation schemes can be used to enable robust implementations of bivariate Jacobi set and Reeb space algorithms. In the process, we develop a method for automatically evaluating predicates that can be expressed as large symbolic polynomials, which are difficult to factor appropriately by hand, as is typically done in the computational geometry literature. We provide implementations of all proposed approaches and evaluate their efficiency.</description>

      <title>Terrain prickliness: theoretical grounds for high complexity viewsheds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.06696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important task in terrain analysis is computing \emph{viewsheds}. A viewshed is the union of all the parts of the
  terrain that are visible from a given viewpoint or set of
  viewpoints. The complexity of a viewshed can vary significantly
  depending on the terrain topography and the viewpoint position. In
  this work we study a new topographic attribute, the
  \emph{prickliness}, that measures the number of local maxima in a
  terrain from all possible angles of view. We show that the
  prickliness effectively captures the potential of 2.5D TIN terrains to have high complexity viewsheds.
  We present
  optimal and (under standard assumptions) near-optimal
  algorithms to compute it for 1.5D and 2.5D TIN terrains, respectively, and efficient approximate algorithms for raster DEMs.
  We validate the usefulness of the prickliness attribute with experiments in a large set of real terrains.</description>

      <title>Box Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new framework that unifies the filtration and mapper approaches from TDA, and present efficient algorithms to compute it. Termed the box filtration of a PCD, we grow boxes (hyperrectangles) that are not necessarily centered at each point (in place of balls centered at points). We grow the boxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the distribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point cover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that works with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either setting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence diagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers satisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using boxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher order intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same.
  Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that optimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of including more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in $O(m|U(0)|\log(mn\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments considered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover ($\leq$ number of points), $\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box dimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and $q = n \times |X|$. We demonstrate through multiple examples that the box filtration can produce more accurate results to summarize the topology of the PCD than VR and distance-to-measure (DTM) filtrations. Software for our implementation is available at https://github.com/pragup/Box-Filteration.</description>

      <title>The Euclidean $k$-Matching Problem is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complete edge-weighted graph on $n$ vertices. To each subset of vertices of $G$ assign the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the subset as its weight. Suppose that $n$ is a multiple of some fixed positive integer $k$. The $k$-matching problem is the problem of finding a partition of the vertices of $G$ into $k$-sets, that minimizes the sum of the weights of the $k$-sets. The case $k=3$ has been shown to be NP-hard [Johnsson et al.,1998]. In the Euclidean version, the vertices of $G$ are points in the plane and the weight of an edge is the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. We call this problem the Euclidean $k$-matching problem. We show that, for every fixed $k \ge 3$, the Euclidean $k$-matching is NP-hard. This resolves an open problem in the literature and provides the first theoretical justification for the use of known heuristic methods in the case $k=3$. We also show that the problem remains NP-hard if the trees are required to be paths.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Adversarial Influence: Characterizing LLM Latent Spaces with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short by focusing on linear directions or isolated features, overlooking the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and relational geometry within model representations. This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically affect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly understood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics within LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six state-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect prompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent topological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model sizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent space becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact, small-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones. This topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly discriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial effects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and neuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals fundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary perspective to existing interpretability methods.</description>
