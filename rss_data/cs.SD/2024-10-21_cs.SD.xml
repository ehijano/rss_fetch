      <title>ImmerseDiffusion: A Generative Spatial Audio Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ImmerseDiffusion, an end-to-end generative audio model that produces 3D immersive soundscapes conditioned on the spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions of sound objects. ImmerseDiffusion is trained to generate first-order ambisonics (FOA) audio, which is a conventional spatial audio format comprising four channels that can be rendered to multichannel spatial output. The proposed generative system is composed of a spatial audio codec that maps FOA audio to latent components, a latent diffusion model trained based on various user input types, namely, text prompts, spatial, temporal and environmental acoustic parameters, and optionally a spatial audio and text encoder trained in a Contrastive Language and Audio Pretraining (CLAP) style. We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the generated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of generation quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes: ``descriptive", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric", which uses non-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate promising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect reliable spatial fidelity.</description>

      <title>Audio Processing using Pattern Recognition for Music Genre Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset, which contains 100 audio files per genre. Motivated by the growing demand for personalized music recommendations, we focused on classifying five genres-Blues, Classical, Jazz, Hip Hop, and Country-using a variety of algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented via Keras. The ANN model demonstrated the best performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 92.44%. We also analyzed key audio features such as spectral roll-off, spectral centroid, and MFCCs, which helped enhance the model's accuracy. Future work will expand the model to cover all ten genres, investigate advanced methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ensemble approaches, and develop a web application for real-time genre classification and playlist generation. This research aims to contribute to improving music recommendation systems and content curation.</description>

      <title>Improving Pronunciation and Accent Conversion through Knowledge Distillation And Synthetic Ground-Truth from Native TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous approaches on accent conversion (AC) mainly aimed at making non-native speech sound more native while maintaining the original content and speaker identity. However, non-native speakers sometimes have pronunciation issues, which can make it difficult for listeners to understand them. Hence, we developed a new AC approach that not only focuses on accent conversion but also improves pronunciation of non-native accented speaker. By providing the non-native audio and the corresponding transcript, we generate the ideal ground-truth audio with native-like pronunciation with original duration and prosody. This ground-truth data aids the model in learning a direct mapping between accented and native speech. We utilize the end-to-end VITS framework to achieve high-quality waveform reconstruction for the AC task. As a result, our system not only produces audio that closely resembles native accents and while retaining the original speaker's identity but also improve pronunciation, as demonstrated by evaluation results.</description>

      <title>PAT: Parameter-Free Audio-Text Aligner to Boost Zero-Shot Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot audio classification. In this paper, we introduce PAT (Parameter-free Audio-Text aligner), a simple and training-free method aimed at boosting the zero-shot audio classification performance of CLAP-like ALMs. To achieve this, we propose to improve the cross-modal interaction between audio and language modalities by enhancing the representations for both modalities using mutual feedback. Precisely, to enhance textual representations, we propose a prompt ensemble algorithm that automatically selects and combines the most relevant prompts from a datastore with a large pool of handcrafted prompts and weighs them according to their relevance to the audio. On the other hand, to enhance audio representations, we reweigh the frame-level audio features based on the enhanced textual information. Our proposed method does not require any additional modules or parameters and can be used with any existing CLAP-like ALM to improve zero-shot audio classification performance. We experiment across 18 diverse benchmark datasets and 6 ALMs and show that the PAT outperforms vanilla zero-shot evaluation with significant margins of 0.42%-27.0%. Additionally, we demonstrate that PAT maintains robust performance even when input audio is degraded by varying levels of noise. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>ConSinger: Efficient High-Fidelity Singing Voice Generation with Minimal Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is expected to generate high-fidelity singing voice from given music scores (lyrics, duration and pitch). Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality. Audio samples are available at https://keylxiao.github.io/consinger.</description>

      <title>Construction and Analysis of Impression Caption Dataset for Environmental Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some datasets with the described content and order of occurrence of sounds have been released for conversion between environmental sound and text. However, there are very few texts that include information on the impressions humans feel, such as "sharp" and "gorgeous," when they hear environmental sounds. In this study, we constructed a dataset with impression captions for environmental sounds that describe the impressions humans have when hearing these sounds. We used ChatGPT to generate impression captions and selected the most appropriate captions for sound by humans. Our dataset consists of 3,600 impression captions for environmental sounds. To evaluate the appropriateness of impression captions for environmental sounds, we conducted subjective and objective evaluations. From our evaluation results, we indicate that appropriate impression captions for environmental sounds can be generated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OpenMU-Bench, a large-scale benchmark suite for addressing the data scarcity issue in training multimodal language models to understand music. To construct OpenMU-Bench, we leveraged existing datasets and bootstrapped new annotations. OpenMU-Bench also broadens the scope of music understanding by including lyrics understanding and music tool usage. Using OpenMU-Bench, we trained our music understanding model, OpenMU, with extensive ablations, demonstrating that OpenMU outperforms baseline models such as MU-Llama. Both OpenMU and OpenMU-Bench are open-sourced to facilitate future research in music understanding and to enhance creative music production efficiency.</description>

      <title>ALDAS: Audio-Linguistic Data Augmentation for Spoofed Audio Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoofed audio, i.e. audio that is manipulated or AI-generated deepfake audio, is difficult to detect when only using acoustic features. Some recent innovative work involving AI-spoofed audio detection models augmented with phonetic and phonological features of spoken English, manually annotated by experts, led to improved model performance. While this augmented model produced substantial improvements over traditional acoustic features based models, a scalability challenge motivates inquiry into auto labeling of features. In this paper we propose an AI framework, Audio-Linguistic Data Augmentation for Spoofed audio detection (ALDAS), for auto labeling linguistic features. ALDAS is trained on linguistic features selected and extracted by sociolinguistics experts; these auto labeled features are used to evaluate the quality of ALDAS predictions. Findings indicate that while the detection enhancement is not as substantial as when involving the pure ground truth linguistic features, there is improvement in performance while achieving auto labeling. Labels generated by ALDAS are also validated by the sociolinguistics experts.</description>

      <title>Moonshine: Speech Recognition for Live Transcription and Voice Commands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Moonshine, a family of speech recognition models optimized for live transcription and voice command processing. Moonshine is based on an encoder-decoder transformer architecture and employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) instead of traditional absolute position embeddings. The model is trained on speech segments of various lengths, but without using zero-padding, leading to greater efficiency for the encoder during inference time. When benchmarked against OpenAI's Whisper tiny.en, Moonshine Tiny demonstrates a 5x reduction in compute requirements for transcribing a 10-second speech segment while incurring no increase in word error rates across standard evaluation datasets. These results highlight Moonshine's potential for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Model Optimization over Multiple Data Sources: Merging and Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rising awareness of privacy protection and the voluminous scale of speech data, it is becoming infeasible for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developers to train the acoustic model with complete data as before. For example, the data may be owned by different curators, and it is not allowed to share with others. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to solve salient problems plaguing the ASR field. In the first stage, multiple acoustic models are trained based upon different subsets of the complete speech data, while in the second phase, two novel algorithms are utilized to generate a high-quality acoustic model based upon those trained on data subsets. We first propose the Genetic Merge Algorithm (GMA), which is a highly specialized algorithm for optimizing acoustic models but suffers from low efficiency. We further propose the SGD-Based Optimizational Merge Algorithm (SOMA), which effectively alleviates the efficiency bottleneck of GMA and maintains superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on public data show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we introduce Shapley Value to estimate the contribution score of the trained models, which is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the data and providing fair incentives to their curators.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neural Speech Codec for Low-Bitrate Compression via Multi-Scale Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have demonstrated their ability to compress high-quality speech and audio by converting them into discrete token representations. Most existing methods utilize Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to encode speech into multiple layers of discrete codes with uniform time scales. However, this strategy overlooks the differences in information density across various speech features, leading to redundant encoding of sparse information, which limits the performance of these methods at low bitrate. This paper proposes MsCodec, a novel multi-scale neural speech codec that encodes speech into multiple layers of discrete codes, each corresponding to a different time scale. This encourages the model to decouple speech features according to their diverse information densities, consequently enhancing the performance of speech compression. Furthermore, we incorporate mutual information loss to augment the diversity among speech codes across different layers. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves codec performance at low bitrate.</description>

      <title>A two-stage transliteration approach to improve performance of a multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are rapidly claiming to become state-of-art over other modeling methods. Several techniques have been introduced to improve their ability to handle multiple languages. However, due to variation in writing scripts for different languages, while decoding acoustically similar units, they do not always map to an appropriate grapheme in the target language. This restricts the scalability and adaptability of the model while dealing with multiple languages in code-mixing scenarios. This paper presents an approach to build a language-agnostic end-to-end model trained on a grapheme set obtained by projecting the multilingual grapheme data to the script of a more generic target language. This approach saves the acoustic model from retraining to span over a larger space and can easily be extended to multiple languages. A two-stage transliteration process realizes this approach and proves to minimize speech-class confusion. We performed experiments with an end-to-end multilingual speech recognition system for two Indic Languages, namely Nepali and Telugu. The original grapheme space of these languages is projected to the Devanagari script. We achieved a relative reduction of 20% in the Word Error Rate (WER) and 24% in the Character Error Rate (CER) in the transliterated space, over other language-dependent modeling methods.</description>

      <title>AC-Mix: Self-Supervised Adaptation for Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition using Agnostic Contrastive Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages large amounts of unlabelled data to learn rich speech representations, fostering improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), even when only a small amount of labelled data is available for fine-tuning. Despite the advances in SSL, a significant challenge remains when the data used for pre-training (source domain) mismatches the fine-tuning data (target domain). To tackle this domain mismatch challenge, we propose a new domain adaptation method for low-resource ASR focused on contrastive mixup for joint-embedding architectures named AC-Mix (agnostic contrastive mixup). In this approach, the SSL model is adapted through additional pre-training using mixed data views created by interpolating samples from the source and the target domains. Our proposed adaptation method consistently outperforms the baseline system, using approximately 11 hours of adaptation data and requiring only 1 hour of adaptation time on a single GPU with WavLM-Large.</description>

      <title>BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>DM-Codec: Distilling Multimodal Representations for Speech Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

      <title>Ichigo: Mixed-Modal Early-Fusion Realtime Voice Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their application to speech-based tasks remains challenging due to the complexities of integrating audio and text modalities. This paper introduces Ichigo, a mixed-modal model that seamlessly processes interleaved sequences of speech and text. Utilizing a tokenized early-fusion approach, Ichigo quantizes speech into discrete tokens and employs a uniform transformer-based architecture for both speech and text modalities. This method enables joint reasoning and generation across modalities without the need for separate adapters. We present a comprehensive training methodology, including pre-training on multilingual speech recognition datasets and fine-tuning on a curated instruction dataset. Ichigo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on speech question-answering benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source speech language models and achieving comparable results to cascaded systems. Notably, Ichigo exhibits a latency of just 111 ms to first token generation, significantly lower than current models. Our approach not only advances the field of multimodal AI but also provides a framework for smaller research teams to contribute effectively to open-source speech-language models.</description>

      <title>Improving Voice Quality in Speech Anonymization With Just Perception-Informed Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of cloud-based speech assistants has heightened the need for effective speech anonymization, which aims to obscure a speaker's identity while retaining critical information for subsequent tasks. One approach to achieving this is through voice conversion. While existing methods often emphasize complex architectures and training techniques, our research underscores the importance of loss functions inspired by the human auditory system. Our proposed loss functions are model-agnostic, incorporating handcrafted and deep learning-based features to effectively capture quality representations. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that a VQVAE-based model, enhanced with our perception-driven losses, surpasses the vanilla model in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, and prosody while maintaining speaker anonymity. These improvements are consistently observed across various datasets, languages, target speakers, and genders.</description>

      <title>Anonymising Elderly and Pathological Speech: Voice Conversion Using DDSP and Query-by-Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech anonymisation aims to protect speaker identity by changing personal identifiers in speech while retaining linguistic content. Current methods fail to retain prosody and unique speech patterns found in elderly and pathological speech domains, which is essential for remote health monitoring. To address this gap, we propose a voice conversion-based method (DDSP-QbE) using differentiable digital signal processing and query-by-example. The proposed method, trained with novel losses, aids in disentangling linguistic, prosodic, and domain representations, enabling the model to adapt to uncommon speech patterns. Objective and subjective evaluations show that DDSP-QbE significantly outperforms the voice conversion state-of-the-art concerning intelligibility, prosody, and domain preservation across diverse datasets, pathologies, and speakers while maintaining quality and speaker anonymity. Experts validate domain preservation by analysing twelve clinically pertinent domain attributes.</description>

      <title>Interventional Speech Noise Injection for ASR Generalizable Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been increasingly adopted in spoken language understanding (SLU). However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems frequently produce inaccurate transcriptions, leading to noisy inputs for SLU models, which can significantly degrade their performance. To address this, our objective is to train SLU models to withstand ASR errors by exposing them to noises commonly observed in ASR systems, referred to as ASR-plausible noises. Speech noise injection (SNI) methods have pursued this objective by introducing ASR-plausible noises, but we argue that these methods are inherently biased towards specific ASR systems, or ASR-specific noises. In this work, we propose a novel and less biased augmentation method of introducing the noises that are plausible to any ASR system, by cutting off the non-causal effect of noises. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of SLU models against unseen ASR systems by introducing more diverse and plausible ASR noises in advance.</description>

      <title>LSCodec: Low-Bitrate and Speaker-Decoupled Discrete Speech Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models. In this work, we propose LSCodec, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability. LSCodec adopts a three-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique. A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space. A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from LSCodec. By reconstruction experiments, LSCodec demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines. The 25Hz version of LSCodec also achieves the lowest bitrate (0.25kbps) of codecs so far with decent quality. Voice conversion evaluations prove the satisfactory speaker disentanglement of LSCodec, and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.</description>

      <title>Yeah, Un, Oh: Continuous and Real-time Backchannel Prediction with Fine-tuning of Voice Activity Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human conversations, short backchannel utterances such as "yeah" and "oh" play a crucial role in facilitating smooth and engaging dialogue. These backchannels signal attentiveness and understanding without interrupting the speaker, making their accurate prediction essential for creating more natural conversational agents. This paper proposes a novel method for real-time, continuous backchannel prediction using a fine-tuned Voice Activity Projection (VAP) model. While existing approaches have relied on turn-based or artificially balanced datasets, our approach predicts both the timing and type of backchannels in a continuous and frame-wise manner on unbalanced, real-world datasets. We first pre-train the VAP model on a general dialogue corpus to capture conversational dynamics and then fine-tune it on a specialized dataset focused on backchannel behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods in both timing and type prediction tasks, achieving robust performance in real-time environments. This research offers a promising step toward more responsive and human-like dialogue systems, with implications for interactive spoken dialogue applications such as virtual assistants and robots.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Speaker Representation for Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) relies on a reference cue of the target to extract the target speech from a speech mixture. While a speaker embedding is commonly used as the reference cue, such embedding pre-trained with a large number of speakers may suffer from confusion of speaker identity. In this work, we propose a multi-level speaker representation approach, from raw features to neural embeddings, to serve as the speaker reference cue. We generate a spectral-level representation from the enrollment magnitude spectrogram as a raw, low-level feature, which significantly improves the model's generalization capability. Additionally, we propose a contextual embedding feature based on cross-attention mechanisms that integrate frame-level embeddings from a pre-trained speaker encoder. By incorporating speaker features across multiple levels, we significantly enhance the performance of the TSE model. Our approach achieves a 2.74 dB improvement and a 4.94% increase in extraction accuracy on Libri2mix test set over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Can Large Audio-Language Models Truly Hear? Tackling Hallucinations with Multi-Task Assessment and Stepwise Audio Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about audio and speech information. However, these models still face challenges, including hallucinating non-existent sound events, misidentifying the order of sound events, and incorrectly attributing sound sources, which undermine their reliability and real-world application. To systematically evaluate these issues, we propose three distinct tasks: object existence, temporal order, and object attribute within audio. These tasks assess the models' comprehension of critical audio information aspects. Our experimental results reveal limitations in these fundamental tasks, underscoring the need for better models in recognizing specific sound events, determining event sequences, and identifying sound sources. To improve performance in these areas, we introduce a multi-turn chain-of-thought approach, which demonstrates significantly improved model performance across the proposed tasks.</description>

      <title>RISC: A Corpus for Shout Type Classification and Shout Intensity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of shouted speech is crucial in audio surveillance and monitoring. Although it is desirable for a security system to be able to identify emergencies, existing corpora provide only a binary label (i.e., shouted or normal) for each speech sample, making it difficult to predict the shout intensity. Furthermore, most corpora comprise only utterances typical of hazardous situations, meaning that classifiers cannot learn to discriminate such utterances from shouts typical of less hazardous situations, such as cheers. Thus, this paper presents a novel research source, the RItsumeikan Shout Corpus (RISC), which contains wide variety types of shouted speech samples collected in recording experiments. Each shouted speech sample in RISC has a shout type and is also assigned shout intensity ratings via a crowdsourcing service. We also present a comprehensive performance comparison among deep learning approaches for speech type classification tasks and a shout intensity prediction task. The results show that feature learning based on the spectral and cepstral domains achieves high performance, no matter which network architecture is used. The results also demonstrate that shout type classification and intensity prediction are still challenging tasks, and RISC is expected to contribute to further development in this research area.</description>

Abstract: We propose a speech enhancement system for multitrack audio. The system will minimize auditory masking while allowing one to hear multiple simultaneous speakers. The system can be used in multiple communication scenarios e.g., teleconferencing, invoice gaming, and live streaming. The ITU-R BS.1387 Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) model is used to evaluate the amount of masking in the audio signals. Different audio effects e.g., level balance, equalization, dynamic range compression, and spatialization are applied via an iterative Harmony searching algorithm that aims to minimize the masking. In the subjective listening test, the designed system can compete with mixes by professional sound engineers and outperforms mixes by existing auto-mixing systems.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival Estimation and Phase Unwrapping of Head-related Transfer Functions With Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In binaural audio synthesis, aligning head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) in time has been an important pre-processing step, enabling accurate spatial interpolation and efficient data compression. The maximum correlation time delay between spatially nearby HRIRs has previously been used to get accurate and smooth alignment by solving a matrix equation in which the solution has the minimum Euclidean distance to the time delay. However, the Euclidean criterion could lead to an over-smoothing solution in practice. In this paper, we solve the smoothing issue by formulating the task as solving an integer linear programming problem equivalent to minimising an $L^1$-norm. Moreover, we incorporate 1) the cross-correlation of inter-aural HRIRs, and 2) HRIRs with their minimum-phase responses to have more reference measurements for optimisation. We show the proposed method can get more accurate alignments than the Euclidean-based method by comparing the spectral reconstruction loss of time-aligned HRIRs using spherical harmonics representation on seven HRIRs consisting of human and dummy heads. The extra correlation features and the $L^1$-norm are also beneficial in extremely noisy conditions. In addition, this method can be applied to phase unwrapping of head-related transfer functions, where the unwrapped phase could be a compact feature for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are usually grouped as autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. The autoregressive systems implicitly model duration but exhibit certain deficiencies in robustness and lack of duration controllability. Non-autoregressive systems require explicit alignment information between text and speech during training and predict durations for linguistic units (e.g. phone), which may compromise their naturalness. In this paper, we introduce Masked Generative Codec Transformer (MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive TTS model that eliminates the need for explicit alignment information between text and speech supervision, as well as phone-level duration prediction. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first stage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech self-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model predicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows the mask-and-predict learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to predict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and prompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in a parallel manner. Experiments with 100K hours of in-the-wild speech demonstrate that MaskGCT outperforms the current state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in terms of quality, similarity, and intelligibility. Audio samples are available at https://maskgct.github.io/. We release our code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/blob/main/models/tts/maskgct.</description>

      <title>Conditioning and Sampling in Variational Diffusion Models for Speech Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have been increasingly used in audio processing tasks, including speech super-resolution (SR), which aims to restore high-frequency content given low-resolution speech utterances. This is commonly achieved by conditioning the network of noise predictor with low-resolution audio. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling algorithm that communicates the information of the low-resolution audio via the reverse sampling process of DMs. The proposed method can be a drop-in replacement for the vanilla sampling process and can significantly improve the performance of the existing works. Moreover, by coupling the proposed sampling method with an unconditional DM, i.e., a DM with no auxiliary inputs to its noise predictor, we can generalize it to a wide range of SR setups. We also attain state-of-the-art results on the VCTK Multi-Speaker benchmark with this novel formulation.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Duet Singing Voices Separation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent studies, diffusion models have shown promise as priors for solving audio inverse problems. These models allow us to sample from the posterior distribution of a target signal given an observed signal by manipulating the diffusion process. However, when separating audio sources of the same type, such as duet singing voices, the prior learned by the diffusion process may not be sufficient to maintain the consistency of the source identity in the separated audio. For example, the singer may change from one to another occasionally. Tackling this problem will be useful for separating sources in a choir, or a mixture of multiple instruments with similar timbre, without acquiring large amounts of paired data. In this paper, we examine this problem in the context of duet singing voices separation, and propose a method to enforce the coherency of singer identity by splitting the mixture into overlapping segments and performing posterior sampling in an auto-regressive manner, conditioning on the previous segment.

      <title>Spirit LM: Interleaved Spoken and Written Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Spirit LM, a foundation multimodal language model that freely mixes text and speech. Our model is based on a 7B pretrained text language model that we extend to the speech modality by continuously training it on text and speech units. Speech and text sequences are concatenated as a single stream of tokens, and trained with a word-level interleaving method using a small automatically-curated speech-text parallel corpus. Spirit LM comes in two versions: a Base version that uses speech phonetic units (HuBERT) and an Expressive version that models expressivity using pitch and style units in addition to the phonetic units. For both versions, the text is encoded with subword BPE tokens. The resulting model displays both the semantic abilities of text models and the expressive abilities of speech models. Additionally, we demonstrate that Spirit LM can learn new tasks in a few-shot fashion across modalities (i.e. ASR, TTS, Speech Classification). We make available model weights and inference code.</description>

      <title>Differentiable All-pole Filters for Time-varying Audio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite impulse response filters are an essential building block of many time-varying audio systems, such as audio effects and synthesisers. However, their recursive structure impedes end-to-end training of these systems using automatic differentiation. Although non-recursive filter approximations like frequency sampling and frame-based processing have been proposed and widely used in previous works, they cannot accurately reflect the gradient of the original system. We alleviate this difficulty by re-expressing a time-varying all-pole filter to backpropagate the gradients through itself, so the filter implementation is not bound to the technical limitations of automatic differentiation frameworks. This implementation can be employed within audio systems containing filters with poles for efficient gradient evaluation. We demonstrate its training efficiency and expressive capabilities for modelling real-world dynamic audio systems on a phaser, time-varying subtractive synthesiser, and compressor. We make our code and audio samples available and provide the trained audio effect and synth models in a VST plugin at https://diffapf.github.io/web/.</description>

      <title>Any2Point: Empowering Any-modality Large Models for Efficient 3D Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</description>

      <title>BERP: A Blind Estimator of Room Acoustic and Physical Parameters for Single-Channel Noisy Speech Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room acoustic parameters (RAPs) and room physical parameters (RPPs) are essential metrics for parameterizing the room acoustical characteristics (RACs) of a sound field around a listener's local environment, offering comprehensive indications for various applications. Current RAP and RPP estimation methods either fall short of covering broad real-world acoustic environments in the context of real background noise or lack universal frameworks for blindly estimating RAPs and RPPs from noisy single-channel speech signals, particularly sound source distances, direction of arrival (DOA) of sound sources, and occupancy levels. On the other hand, in this paper, we propose a new universal blind estimation framework called the blind estimator of the room acoustical and physical parameters (BERP), by introducing a new stochastic room impulse response (RIR) model, namely the sparse stochastic impulse response (SSIR) model, and endowing the BERP with a unified encoder and multiple separate predictors to estimate the RPPs and the parameters SSIR in parallel. This estimation framework enables computationally efficient and universal estimation of room parameters using only noisy single-channel speech signals. Finally, all RAPs can be simultaneously derived from RIRs synthesized from the SSIR model with estimated parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed BERP and SSIR models, we compile a task-specific dataset from several publicly available datasets. The results reveal that the BERP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In addition, the evaluation results for the SSIR RIR model also demonstrated its efficacy. The code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Non-autoregressive Generation Framework for End-to-End Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous translation models play a crucial role in facilitating communication. However, existing research primarily focuses on text-to-text or speech-to-text models, necessitating additional cascade components to achieve speech-to-speech translation. These pipeline methods suffer from error propagation and accumulate delays in each cascade component, resulting in reduced synchronization between the speaker and listener. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel non-autoregressive generation framework for simultaneous speech translation (NAST-S2X), which integrates speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks into a unified end-to-end framework. We develop a non-autoregressive decoder capable of concurrently generating multiple text or acoustic unit tokens upon receiving fixed-length speech chunks. The decoder can generate blank or repeated tokens and employ CTC decoding to dynamically adjust its latency. Experimental results show that NAST-S2X outperforms state-of-the-art models in both speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks. It achieves high-quality simultaneous interpretation within a delay of less than 3 seconds and provides a 28 times decoding speedup in offline generation.</description>

      <title>A corpus-based investigation of pitch contours of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Mandarin, the tonal contours of monosyllabic words produced in isolation or in careful speech are characterized by four lexical tones: a high-level tone (T1), a rising tone (T2), a dipping tone (T3) and a falling tone (T4). However, in spontaneous speech, the actual tonal realization of monosyllabic words can deviate significantly from these canonical tones due to intra-syllabic co-articulation and inter-syllabic co-articulation with adjacent tones. In addition, Chuang et al. (2024) recently reported that the tonal contours of disyllabic Mandarin words with T2-T4 tone pattern are co-determined by their meanings. Following up on their research, we present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of contextual predictors on the one hand, and the way in words' meanings co-determine pitch contours on the other hand. We analyze the F0 contours of 3824 tokens of 63 different word types in a spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin corpus, using the generalized additive (mixed) model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours. We show that the tonal context substantially modify a word's canonical tone. Once the effect of tonal context is controlled for, T2 and T3 emerge as low flat tones, contrasting with T1 as a high tone, and with T4 as a high-to-mid falling tone. The neutral tone (T0), which in standard descriptions, is realized based on the preceding tone, emerges as a low tone in its own right, modified by the other predictors in the same way as the standard tones T1, T2, T3, and T4. We also show that word, and even more so, word sense, co-determine words' F0 contours. Analyses of variable importance using random forests further supported the substantial effect of tonal context and an effect of word sense.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end neural diarization has evolved considerably over the past few years, but data scarcity is still a major obstacle for further improvements. Self-supervised learning methods such as WavLM have shown promising performance on several downstream tasks, but their application on speaker diarization is somehow limited. In this work, we explore using WavLM to alleviate the problem of data scarcity for neural diarization training. We use the same pipeline as Pyannote and improve the local end-to-end neural diarization with WavLM and Conformer. Experiments on far-field AMI, AISHELL-4, and AliMeeting datasets show that our method substantially outperforms the Pyannote baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art results on AMI and AISHELL-4, respectively. In addition, by analyzing the system performance under different data quantity scenarios, we show that WavLM representations are much more robust against data scarcity than filterbank features, enabling less data hungry training strategies. Furthermore, we found that simulated data, usually used to train endto-end diarization models, does not help when using WavLM in our experiments. Additionally, we also evaluate our model on the recent CHiME8 NOTSOFAR-1 task where it achieves better performance than the Pyannote baseline.
