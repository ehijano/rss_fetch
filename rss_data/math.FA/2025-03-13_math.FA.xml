      <title>Localised frames for tensor product spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether the tensor product of two frames, each individually localised with respect to a spectral matrix algebra, is also localised with respect to a suitably chosen tensor product algebra. We provide a partial answer by constructing an involutive Banach algebra of rank-four tensors that is built from two solid spectral matrix algebras. We show that this algebra is inverse-closed, given that the original algebras satisfy a specific property related to operator-valued versions of these algebras. This condition is satisfied by all commonly used solid spectral matrix algebras. We then prove that the tensor product of two self-localised frames remains self-localised with respect to our newly constructed tensor algebra. Additionally, we discuss generalisations to localised frames of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, which may not necessarily consist of rank-one operators.</description>

      <title>Accretive Partial Transpose Matrices and Their Connections to Matrix Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretive partial transpose (APT) matrices have been recently defined, as a natural extension of positive partial transpose (PPT) matrices.
  In this paper, we discuss further properties of APT matrices in a way that extends some of those properties known for PPT matrices.
  Among many results, we show that
  if \(A,B,X\) are $n\times n$ complex matrices such that \(A,B\) are sectorial with sector angle $\alpha$ for some \(\alpha\in [0,\pi/2)\), and if \(f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)\) is a certain operator monotone function such that \(\begin{bmatrix}
  \cos^2(\alpha) f(A) &amp; X
  X^* &amp; \cos^2(\alpha) f(B)
  \end{bmatrix}\) is APT, Then \(\begin{bmatrix}
  f(A)\nabla_t f(B) &amp; X
  X^* &amp; f(A \nabla_tB )
  \end{bmatrix}\) is APT for any \(0\leq t\leq 1\), where $\nabla_t$ is the weighted arithmetic mean.</description>

      <title>Comparison of tuples of operators and its components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For tuples of compact operators $\mathcal{T}=(T_1,\ldots, T_d)$ and $\mathcal{S}=(S_1,$ $\ldots,S_d)$ on Banach spaces over a field $\mathbb{F}$, considering the joint $p$-operator norms on the tuples, we study $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S}),$ the distance of $\mathcal{T}$ from the $d$-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{F}^d\mathcal{S}:=\{\textbf{z}\mathcal{S}:\textbf{z}\in \mathbb{F}^d\}.$ We obtain a relation between $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})$ and $dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i),$ for $1\leq i\leq d.$ We prove that if $p=\infty,$ then $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})=\underset{1\leq i\leq d}{\max}dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i),$ and for $1\leq p&lt;\infty,$ under a sufficient condition, $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})^p=\underset{1\leq i\leq d}{\sum}dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i)^p.$ As a consequence, we deduce the equivalence of Birkhoff-James orthogonality, $\mathcal{T}\perp_B \mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S} \Leftrightarrow T_i\perp_B S_i,$ under a sufficient condition. Furthermore, we explore the relation of one sided Gateaux derivatives of $\mathcal{T}$ in the direction of $\mathcal{S}$ with that of $T_i$ in the direction of $S_i.$ Applying this, we explore the relation between the smoothness of $\mathcal{T}$ and $T_i.$ By identifying an operator, whose range is $\ell_\infty^d,$ as a tuple of functionals, we effectively use the results obtained here for operators whose range is $\ell_\infty^d$ and deduce nice results involving functionals. It provides another perspective of studying tuples of operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the best approximation in quasi-cone metric spaces, a combination of quasi-metrics and cone metrics, which generalizes the notion of distance by allowing it to take values in an ordered Banach space. We explore the fundamental properties of best approximations in this setting, such as the best approximation sets and the Chebyshev sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study composition operators on Hilbert space of complex-valued harmonic functions. In particular, we explore isometries, the type of self-map that generate bounded composition operator, and characterize the boundedness of composition operator in terms of Poisson integral. Furthermore, we establish the relation between reproducing kernels and composition operators on Hilbert space of complex-valued harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Banach spaces I -- Directed completion of partial orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is to advertise the concept of directed completion of partial orders as the natural analogue of Cauchy-completion in Lorentzian signature, especially in relation to non-smooth and/or infinite dimensional geometries.
  A closely related notion appeared in the recent [2] where it was used as ground for further development of non-smooth calculus in metric spacetimes allowing, for instance, for a quite general limit curve theorem in such setting. The proposal in [2] was also in part motivated by the discussion we make here, key points being:
  - A general existence result, already obtained in the context of theoretical computer science and for which we give a slightly different presentation.
  - An example showing that an analogue two-sided completion is unsuitable from the (or at least `some') geometric/analytic perspective.
  - The existence of natural links with both the the concept of ideal point of Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose and with Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem, showing in particular an underlying commonality between these two seemingly far concepts.
  - The flexibility of the notion, that by nature can cover non-smooth and infinite-dimensional situations.
  - The fact that the concept emerges spontaneously when investigating the duality relations between $L^p$ and $L^q$ spaces where $\tfrac1p+\tfrac 1q = 1$ are H\"older conjugate exponents with $p, q &lt; 1$.
  This note is part of a larger work in progress that aims at laying the grounds of a Lorentzian, or Hyperbolic, theory of Banach spaces. Given that the notion of completion has nothing to do with the linear structure and the growing interest around this topic, for instance related to convergence of geometric structures, we make available these partial findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit several bounds for operator norms of the sum of $\epsilon$-free semicircular random variables introduced in the paper of Speicher and Wysocza\'{n}ski. In particular, using the first and second largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $\epsilon$, we show analogs of the operator-valued Khintchine-type inequality obtained by Haagerup and Pisier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formula for the interpolation of matrix weighted spaces of vector valued functions via interpolation functors. We apply our formula to the particular case of interpolation of matrix weighted $L^p$ spaces by the real and complex methods, and present consequences regarding the matrix Muckenhoupt classes and commutator estimates of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators with matrix $BMO$ functions. In particular, we characterize the logarithms of Muckenhoupt weights through higher order commutators.</description>

      <title>The multifractal nature of a parametrized family of von Koch functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a famous paper published in 1904, Helge von Koch introduced the curve that still serves nowadays as an iconic representation of fractal shapes. In fact, von Koch's main goal was the construction of a continuous but nowhere differentiable function, very similar to the snowflake, using elementary geometric procedures, and not analytical formulae. We prove that a parametrized family of functions (including and) generalizing von Koch's example enjoys a rich multifractal behavior, thus enriching the class of historical mathematical objects having surprising regularity properties. The analysis relies on the study of the orbits of an underlying dynamical system and on the introduction of self-similar measures and non-trivial iterated functions systems adapted to the problem.</description>

      <title>Composition structure of polyconvolution associated with index Kontorovich-Lebedev transform and Fourier integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Kakichev's classical concept and extending Yakubovich-Britvina's approach (\textit{Results. Math.} 55(1-2):175-197, 2009) and (\textit{Integral Transforms Spec. Funct.} 21(4):259--276, 2010) for setting up Kontorovich-Lebedev convolution operators, this paper proposes a new polyconvolution structure associated with the KL-transform and Fourier integrals. Our main contributions include demonstrating a one-dimensional Watson-type transform, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for this transform to serve as unitary on $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and inferring its inverse operator in symmetric form. The existence of this structure over specific function spaces and its connection with previously known convolutions are pointed out. Establish the Plancherel-type theorem, prove the convergence in the mean-square sense in $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and prove the boundedness of dual spaces via Riesz-Thorin's theorem. Derives new weighted $L_p$-norm inequalities and boundedness in a three-parametric family of Lebesgue spaces. These theoretical findings are applied to solve specific classes of the Toeplitz-Hankel equation, providing a priori estimations based on the established conditions for $L_1$ solvability.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Wigner Distribution in the Linear Canonical Transform Domain: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper devotes to combine the chirp basis function transformation and symplectic coordinates transformation to yield a novel Wigner distribution (WD) associated with the linear canonical transform (LCT), named as the symplectic WD in the LCT domain (SWDL). It incorporates the merits of the symplectic WD (SWD) and the WD in the LCT domain (WDL), achieving stronger capability in the linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal frequency rate feature extraction while maintaining the same level of computational complexity. Some essential properties of the SWDL are derived, including marginal distributions, energy conservations, unique reconstruction, Moyal formula, complex conjugate symmetry, time reversal symmetry, scaling property, time translation property, frequency modulation property, and time translation and frequency modulation property. Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the SWDL are formulated, giving rise to three kinds of lower bounds attainable respectively by Gaussian enveloped complex exponential signal, Gaussian signal and Gaussian enveloped chirp signal. The optimal symplectic matrices corresponding to the highest time-frequency resolution are generated by solving the lower bound optimization (minimization) problem. The time-frequency resolution of the SWDL is compared with those of the SWD and WDL to demonstrate its superiority in LFM signals time-frequency energy concentration. A synthesis example is also carried out to verify the feasibility and reliability of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear Boussinesq-type models coupled with static interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new approach to analyze the coupling of linear Boussinesq and Saint-Venant shallow water wave equations in the case where the interface remains at a constant position in space. We propose a one-way coupling model as a reference, which allows us to obtain an analytical solution, prove the well-posedness of the original coupled model and compute what we call the coupling error-a quantity that depends solely on the choice of transmission conditions at the interface. We prove that this coupling error is asymptotically small for a certain class of data and discuss its role as a proxy for the full error with respect to the 3D water wave problem. Additionally, we highlight that this error can be easily computed in other scenarios. We show that the coupling error consists of reflected waves and argue that this explains some previously unexplained spurious oscillations reported in the literature. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the half-line linear Boussinesq problem.</description>

      <title>Standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of Cohen's class time-frequency distribution with specific kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-frequency concentration and resolution of the Cohen's class time-frequency distribution (CCTFD) has attracted much attention in time-frequency analysis. A variety of uncertainty principles of the CCTFD is therefore derived, including the weak Heisenberg type, the Hardy type, the Nazarov type, and the local type. However, the standard Heisenberg type still remains unresolved. In this study, we address the question of how the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of the CCTFD is affected by fundamental properties. The investigated distribution properties are Parseval's relation and the concise frequency domain definition (i.e., only frequency variables are explicitly found in the tensor product), based on which we confine our attention to the CCTFD with some specific kernels. That is the unit modulus and v-independent time translation, reversal and scaling invariant kernel CCTFD (UMITRSK-CCTFD). We then extend the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the Wigner distribution to those of the UMITRSK-CCTFD, giving birth to various types of attainable lower bounds on the uncertainty product in the UMITRSK-CCTFD domain. The derived results strengthen the existing weak Heisenberg type and fill gaps in the standard Heisenberg type.</description>

      <title>Langevin Monte-Carlo Provably Learns Depth Two Neural Nets at Any Size and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. The key observation of ours is that two layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>

      <title>Stability in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop foundational aspects of stability theory in affine logic. On the one hand, we prove appropriate affine versions of many classical results, including definability of types, existence of non-forking extensions, and other fundamental properties of forking calculus. Most notably, stationarity holds over arbitrary sets (in fact, every type is Lascar strong). On the other hand, we prove that stability is preserved under direct integrals of measurable fields of structures. We deduce that stability in the extremal models of an affine theory implies stability of the theory. We also deduce that the affine part of a stable continuous logic theory is affinely stable, generalising the result of preservation of stability under randomisations.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for infinite, countable, compact, Hausdorff spaces $K,L$, $C(K)\widehat{\otimes}_\pi C(L)$ is isomorphic to exactly one of the spaces $C(\omega^{\omega^\xi})\widehat{\otimes}_\pi C(\omega^{\omega^\zeta})$, $0\leqslant \zeta\leqslant \xi&lt;\omega_1$. We also prove that $C(K)\widehat{\otimes}_\pi C(L)$ is not isomorphic to $C(M)$ for any compact, Hausdorff space $M$.</description>

      <title>Further properties and representations of the W-weighted m-weak group inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore more properties and representations of the W-weighted m-weak group (in short, W-m-WG) inverse. We first explore an interesting relation between two projectors with respect to the W-m-WG inverse. Then, the W-m-WG inverse is represented by various generalized inverses including W-weighted Drazin inverse, W-weighted weak group inverse, W-weighted core inverse, etc. We also give three concise explicit expressions for the W-m-WG inverse. Moreover, a canonical form of the W-m-WG inverse is presented in terms of the singular value decomposition. Finally, several numerical examples are designed to illustrate some results given in the paper.</description>

      <title>Periodic traveling waves for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-zero conditions at infinity in $ \R ^2 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity in $\R^2$. We investigate the existence of traveling waves that are periodic in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation and minimize the energy when the momentum is kept fixed. We show that for any given value of the momentum, there is a critical value of the period such that traveling waves with period smaller than the critical value are one-dimensional, and those with larger periods depend on two variables.</description>

      <title>A note on Erd\H{o}s matrices and Marcus$\unicode{x2013}$Ree inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that any bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\Delta_n(A):= \max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A(i, \sigma(i))-\sum_{i, j=1}^n A(i, j)^2 \geq 0$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_n(A)=0$. It was recently proved that there are only finitely many such matrices for any $n$. However, a complete list of such matrices was obtained in dimension $n=2, 3$ only recently, arXiv:2306.05518. In this paper, we characterize all $4\times 4$ bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_4(A)=0$. Furthermore, we show that for $n\geq 3$, $\Delta_n(A)=\alpha$ has uncountably many solutions when $\alpha\notin \{0, (n-1)/4\}$. This answers a question raised in arXiv:2410.06612. We extend the Marcus$\unicode{x2013}$Ree inequality to infinite bistochastic arrays and bistochastic kernels. Our investigation into $4\times 4$ Erd\H{o}s matrices also raises several intriguing questions that are of independent interest. We propose several questions and conjectures and present numerical evidence for them.</description>
