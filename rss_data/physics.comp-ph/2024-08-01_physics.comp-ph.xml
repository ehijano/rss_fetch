      <title>Invariant Discovery of Features Across Multiple Length Scales: Applications in Microscopy and Autonomous Materials Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical imaging is a foundational characterization method in areas from condensed matter physics and chemistry to astronomy and spans length scales from atomic to universe. Images encapsulate crucial data regarding atomic bonding, materials microstructures, and dynamic phenomena such as microstructural evolution and turbulence, among other phenomena. The challenge lies in effectively extracting and interpreting this information. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying underlying factors of variation in image data, providing a systematic approach to distilling meaningful patterns from complex datasets. However, a significant hurdle in their application is the definition and selection of appropriate descriptors reflecting local structure. Here we introduce the scale-invariant VAE approach (SI-VAE) based on the progressive training of the VAE with the descriptors sampled at different length scales. The SI-VAE allows the discovery of the length scale dependent factors of variation in the system. Here, we illustrate this approach using the ferroelectric domain images and generalize it to the movies of the electron-beam induced phenomena in graphene and topography evolution across combinatorial libraries. This approach can further be used to initialize the decision making in automated experiments including structure-property discovery and can be applied across a broad range of imaging methods. This approach is universal and can be applied to any spatially resolved data including both experimental imaging studies and simulations, and can be particularly useful for exploration of phenomena such as turbulence, scale-invariant transformation fronts, etc.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. This is achieved through the synergy of the PAW method's ability to transform the underlying all-electron DFT problem into a form that involves smoother electronic fields and the potential of systematically convergent higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we employ higher-order quadrature rules to evaluate integrals involving PAW-atomic data accurately, allowing the use of coarser FE meshes for electronic fields. Further, we have developed efficient computational strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigen spectrum in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of FE basis-overlap to invert FE discretized PAW overlap matrix in conjunction with exploiting the FE-cell level structure of both the local and nonlocal parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with state-of-the-art plane wave based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a significant computational advantage over state-of-the-art plane-wave basis for large-scale systems comprising of around 35,000 electrons. Our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required to achieve desired accuracy when compared to norm-conserving pseudopotentials, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations at an order of magnitude lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization for Atomic Cluster Expansion Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based interatomic potentials enable accurate materials simulations on extended time- and lengthscales. ML potentials based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework have recently shown promising performance for this purpose. Here, we describe a largely automated computational approach to optimizing hyperparameters for ACE potential models. We extend our openly available Python package, XPOT, to include an interface for ACE fitting, and discuss the optimization of the functional form and complexity of these models based on systematic sweeps across relevant hyperparameters. We showcase the usefulness of the approach for two example systems: the covalent network of silicon and the phase-change material Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. More generally, our work emphasizes the importance of hyperparameter selection in the development of advanced ML potential models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative learning framework to model high-dimensional parametric systems using gradient guidance and virtual observations. We consider systems described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized with structured or unstructured grids. The framework integrates multi-level information to generate high fidelity time sequences of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our framework with two case studies in incompressible, two dimensional, low Reynolds cylinder flow on an unstructured mesh and incompressible turbulent channel flow on a structured mesh, both parameterized by the Reynolds number. Our results illustrate the framework's robustness and ability to generate accurate flow sequences across various parameter settings, significantly reducing computational costs allowing for efficient forecasting and reconstruction of flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Thermoelectric Potential: A Machine Learning Stacking Approach for Half Heusler Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric properties of Half Heusler alloys are predicted by adopting an ensemble modelling approach, specifically the stacking model integrated using Random Forest and XGBoost scheme. Leveraging a diverse dataset encompassing thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and the figure of merit (ZT), the study demonstrates superior predictive performance of the stacking Model, outperforming individual base models with high R2 values. Key features such as temperature, mean Covalent Radius, and average deviation of the Gibbs energy per atom emerge as critical influencers, highlighting their pivotal roles in optimizing thermoelectric behavior. The unification of Random Forest and XGBoost in the stacking model effectively captures nuanced relationships, offering a holistic understanding of thermoelectric performance in Half Heusler alloys. This work advances predictive modelling in thermoelectricity and provides valuable insights for strategic material design, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and performance in thermoelectric applications. The ensemble modelling framework, coupled with insightful feature selection and meticulous engineering, establishes a robust foundation for future research in pursuing high-performance thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrationally-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Flexible Molecules: Linear Alkanes C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$ ($n$=1-8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrated full core-hole density functional theory with Franck-Condon calculations, considering Duschinsky rotation, to simulate vibrationally-resolved C1s X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of eight linear alkanes, from methane to octane (C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$, $n$=1--8). Results align excellently with experimental absolute binding energies and profiles. The spectrum of ethane serves as a ``spectral seed'', with each longer alkane's atom-specific spectrum displaying similar characteristics, albeit with shifts and slight intensity adjustments. Detailed assignments clarify the distinct spectra in short alkanes ($n$=1--4) and their stabilization in long alkanes ($n$=5--8). Carbons are classified as central or distal (C$_1$ and C$_2$), with central carbons contributing nearly identically to the lowest-energy feature A, while distal carbons contribute to the second lowest-energy feature B (both are 0-0 transitions). Increasing molecule size adds more central carbons, enhancing feature A and weakening feature B. Our analysis identifies two dominant Franck-Condon-active vibrations: C$^*$--H stretching ($\sim$3400-3500 cm$^{-1}$) and bending ($\sim$1400-1500 cm$^{-1}$) modes. Structural analysis shows that core ionization minimally affects alkane geometry, less than in ring compounds from previous studies. This work extends our protocol from rigid ring compounds to flexible molecules, contributing to building a high-resolution theoretical XPS library and enhancing the understanding of vibronic coupling.</description>

      <title>Absorbing Boundary Conditions for Variable Potential Schr\"odinger Equations via Titchmarsh-Weyl Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to simulate the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a general variable potential. The key idea is to approximate the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function (exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator) by a rational function with respect to an appropriate spectral parameter. By using this method, we overcome the usual high-frequency restriction associated with absorbing boundary conditions in general variable potential problems. The resulting fast computational algorithm for absorbing boundary conditions ensures accuracy over the entire frequency range.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} Wannier-representation-based calculations of photocurrent in semiconductors and metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general ab initio method based on Wannier functions using the covariant derivative for simulating the photocurrent in solids. The method is widely applicable to charge/spin DC and AC photocurrent at any perturbation levels in both semiconductors and metals for both linearly and circularly polarized light. This is because the method is theoretically complete (within the relaxation time approximation), that is to say, it includes all intraband, interband and their cross terms. It is also free from the degeneracy issue, i.e., applicable to arbitrary band structures with arbitrary numbers of degenerate bands. We apply the method to various semiconductors and metals, including GaAs, graphene-hBN heterostructure, monolayer WS2, a 2D ferroelectric material - monolayer GeS, bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 and topological Weyl semimetal RhSi, to simulate their charge and/or spin, DC and/or AC photocurrent. Our theoretical results are in agreement with previous theoretical works. Our numerical tests of GaAs, WS2 and GeS suggest setting the degeneracy threshold in the conventional method as \hbar\Gamma^{2}, with \Gamma^{2} the relaxation rate of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix between two states with close energies. We find that compared with the conventional Wannier-function-based method using non-dgenerate perturbation theory, the numerical errors of optical susceptibilities of bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 with the PT symmetry can be reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by our method for circularly polarized light. Our method provides a universal computational tool for reliable and accurate predictions of abundant weak-field photocurrent phenomena in disparate materials.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Grappa -- A Machine Learned Molecular Mechanics Force Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than established molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Here, we propose Grappa, a machine learning framework to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting Grappa force field outperformstabulated and machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations from a small fast folding protein up to a whole virus particle. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations closer to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</description>

      <title>Non-variational Quantum Combinatorial Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems, including constrained and non-binary problems. The algorithm leverages an engineered interference process achieved through repeated application of two unitaries; one inducing phase-shifts dependent on objective function values, and the other mixing phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems, namely those for which solutions are characterised by either a vector of binary variables, a vector of non-binary integer variables, or permutations (a vector of integer variables without repetition). An efficient quantum circuit implementation of the CTQW for each of these problem types is also discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through numerical simulation for randomly generated instances of the following problems (and problem sizes): weighted maxcut (18 vertices), maximum independent set (18 vertices), k-means clustering (12 datapoints, 3 clusters), capacitated facility location (12 customers, 3 facility locations), and the quadratic assignment problem (9 locations). For each problem instance, the algorithm finds a globally optimal solution with a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>The hBN defects database: a theoretical compilation of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>
