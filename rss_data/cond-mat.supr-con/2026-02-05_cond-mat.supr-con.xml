      <title>Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Emergent Coherence at the Edge of Magnetism: Low-Doped La2-xSrxCuO4+delta Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in PbTe/Pb heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.</description>

      <title>Selective electron-phonon coupling strength from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy: The case of MgB$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between quasiparticles and bosonic excitations rules the energy transfer pathways in condensed matter systems. The possibility of inferring the strength of specific coupling channels from their characteristic time scales measured in nonequilibrium experiments is still an open question. Here, we investigate MgB$_2$, in which conventional superconductivity at temperatures as high as 39 K is mediated by the strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the E$_{2g}$ phonon mode. By means of broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling dictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$, at early times ($&lt;$100 fs) after photoexcitation. Furthermore, based on an effective temperature model analysis, we estimate its contribution to the total electron-boson coupling function extracted from complementary equilibrium spectroscopy approaches, namely optical reflectivity and ARPES. The coupling strength with the E$_{2g}$ phonon modes is thus estimated to be $\lambda \simeq$ 0.56, which is approximately half of the total coupling constant, in agreement with ab-initio calculations from the literature. As a benchmark, broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy is performed also on the isostructural and non-superconducting compound AlB$_2$, showing that the nonequilibrium optical response relaxes on a slower time scale due to the lack of strongly-coupled phonon modes. Our findings demonstrate the possibility to resolve and quantify selective electron-phonon coupling from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Revealing THz optical signatures of Shiba-state-induced gapped and gapless superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Systematic Schrieffer-Wolff-transformation approach to Josephson junctions: quasiparticle effects and Josephson harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) to analyze Josephson junctions between superconducting leads described by the charge-conserving BCS theory. Starting from the single-electron tunneling terms, we directly recover the conventional effective Hamiltonian, $-E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$, with an operator-valued phase bias $\hat{\varphi}$. The SWT approach has the advantage that it can be systematically extended to more complex scenarios. We show that if a Bogoliubov quasiparticle is present its motion couples to that of Cooper pairs, introducing correlated dynamics that reshape the energy spectrum of the junction. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the SWT naturally describe Josephson harmonics, whose amplitudes are directly related to the microscopic properties of the superconducting leads and the junction. We derive expressions that could facilitate tuning the ratio between the different harmonics in a controlled way.</description>

      <title>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena, but their study has involved two-dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with spin-singlet chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the interplay between superconducting and altermagnetic symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands are topologically protected, appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, and their number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed flat bands or surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to the coexistence of three distinct dependences of the charge conductance on the normal transparency, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher-dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Kagome Superconductors YRu3B2 and LuRu3B2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle generation by microwave drives in superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave drives play a central role in the control of superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multiphoton pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles (QPs) and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multiphoton-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by charge- or flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that photon-assisted QP generation may affect novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving.</description>

      <title>High spin, low spin or gapped spins: magnetism in the bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $\pi$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We show that both the topological (MZMs and MPMs) and trivial (TZMs and TPMs) edge modes are robust against onsite disorder. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-1/2: Multipolar spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric crystals with time-reversal symmetry</title>

Abstract: We develop a symmetry-adapted multipolar $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory close to the bulk $\Gamma$ point for time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ crystals in the strong atomic spin-orbit-coupling ($jj$-coupling) limit. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j&gt;1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</description>

      <title>Topological Charge-2ne Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\'e materials. In this work we develop a general framework for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states, in both spinless and spinful systems. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low-energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</description>
