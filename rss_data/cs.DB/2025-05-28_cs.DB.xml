      <title>In-memory Incremental Maintenance of Provenance Sketches [extended version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provenance-based data skipping compactly over-approximates the provenance of a query using so-called provenance sketches and utilizes such sketches to speed-up the execution of subsequent queries by skipping irrelevant data. However, a sketch captured at some time in the past may become stale if the data has been updated subsequently. Thus, there is a need to maintain provenance sketches. In this work, we introduce In-Memory incremental Maintenance of Provenance sketches (IMP), a framework for maintaining sketches incrementally under updates. At the core of IMP is an incremental query engine for data annotated with sketches that exploits the coarse-grained nature of sketches to enable novel optimizations. We experimentally demonstrate that IMP significantly reduces the cost of sketch maintenance, thereby enabling the use of provenance sketches for a broad range of workloads that involve updates.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Knowledge Graph Creation with PyRML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are increasingly adopted as a foundational technology for integrating heterogeneous data in domains such as climate science, cultural heritage, and the life sciences. Declarative mapping languages like R2RML and RML have played a central role in enabling scalable and reusable KG construction, offering a transparent means of transforming structured and semi-structured data into RDF. In this paper, we present PyRML, a lightweight, Python-native library for building Knowledge Graphs through declarative mappings. PyRML supports core RML constructs and provides a programmable interface for authoring, executing, and testing mappings directly within Python environments. It integrates with popular data and semantic web libraries (e.g., Pandas and RDFlib), enabling transparent and modular workflows. By lowering the barrier to entry for KG creation and fostering reproducible, ontology-aligned data integration, PyRML bridges the gap between declarative semantics and practical KG engineering.</description>

      <title>LazyVLM: Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying open-domain video data at scale.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Prompt Optimization in NL2SQL Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations. However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM understand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the go-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.
  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision, high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on similarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative set of exemplars for a given production setting. To this end, we propose a prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through multi-objective optimization. Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Something's Fishy In The Data Lake: A Critical Re-evaluation of Table Union Search Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search.</description>

      <title>RelationalFactQA: A Benchmark for Evaluating Tabular Fact Retrieval from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a persistent challenge. Current benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge. We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.</description>

      <title>Enumeration Algorithms for Conjunctive Queries with Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the enumeration of query results for an important subset of CQs with projections, namely star and path queries. The task is to design data structures and algorithms that allow for efficient enumeration with delay guarantees after a preprocessing phase. Our main contribution is a series of results based on the idea of interleaving precomputed output with further join processing to maintain delay guarantees, which maybe of independent interest. In particular, for star queries, we design combinatorial algorithms that provide instance-specific delay guarantees in linear preprocessing time. These algorithms improve upon the currently best known results. Further, we show how existing results can be improved upon by using fast matrix multiplication. We also present new results involving tradeoff between preprocessing time and delay guarantees for enumeration of path queries that contain projections. Boolean matrix multiplication is an important query that can be expressed as a CQ with projection where the join attribute is projected away. Our results can therefore also be interpreted as sparse, output-sensitive matrix multiplication with delay guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Survey of LLM $\times$ DATA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>KBQA-o1: Agentic Knowledge Base Question Answering with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions with a large-scale structured knowledge base (KB). Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo. Our code is publicly available.</description>
