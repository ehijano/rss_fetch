      <title>CSS161010: a luminous, fast blue optical transient with broad blueshifted hydrogen lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of the luminous, fast blue optical transient (LFBOT), CSS161010:045834-081803 (CSS161010). The transient was found in a low-redshift (z=0.033) dwarf galaxy. The light curves of CSS161010 are characterized by an extremely fast evolution and blue colours. The V-band light curve shows that CSS161010 reaches an absolute peak of M$_{V}^{max}=-20.66\pm0.06$ mag in 3.8 days from the start of the outburst. After maximum, CSS161010 follows a power-law decline $\propto t^{-2.8\pm0.1}$ at all optical bands. These photometric properties are comparable to those of well-observed LFBOTs such as AT 2018cow, AT 2020mrf and AT 2020xnd. However, unlike these objects, the spectra of CSS161010 show a remarkable transformation from a blue and featureless continuum to spectra dominated by very broad, entirely blueshifted hydrogen emission lines of velocities of up to 10% of the speed of light. The persistent blueshifted emission and the lack of any emission at the rest wavelength of CSS161010 are unique features not seen in any transient before CSS161010. The combined observational properties of CSS161010 and its dwarf galaxy host favour the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole as its origin.</description>

      <title>The TRAPUM Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT I: Survey setup and first seven pulsar discoveries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) presents a unique environment for pulsar population studies due to its distinct star formation characteristics and proximity to the Milky Way. As part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) Large Survey Project, we are using the core array of the MeerKAT radio telescope (MeerKAT) to conduct a targeted search of the LMC for radio pulsars at L-band frequencies, 856-1712$\,$MHz. The excellent sensitivity of MeerKAT, coupled with a 2-hour integration time, makes the survey 3 times more sensitive than previous LMC radio pulsar surveys. We report the results from the initial four survey pointings which has resulted in the discovery of seven new radio pulsars, increasing the LMC radio pulsar population by 30 per cent. The pulse periods of these new pulsars range from 278 to 1690$\,$ms, and the highest dispersion measure is 254.20$\,$pc$\,$cm$^{-3}$. We searched for, but did not find any significant pulsed radio emission in a beam centred on the SN$\,$1987A remnant, establishing an upper limit of 6.3$\,{\mu}$Jy on its minimum flux density at 1400$\,$MHz.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between young massive star clusters and gamma-ray unassociated sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters (SCs) are potential cosmic-ray (CR) accelerators and therefore are expected to emit high-energy radiation. However, a clear detection of gamma-ray emission from this source class has only been possible for a handful of cases. This could in principle result from two different reasons: either detectable SCs are limited to a small fraction of the total number of Galactic SCs, or gamma-ray-emitting SCs are not recognized as such and therefore are listed in the ensemble of unidentified sources. In this Letter we investigate this latter scenario, by comparing available catalogs of SCs and HII regions, obtained from Gaia and WISE observations, to the gamma-ray GeV and TeV catalogs built from Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and LHAASO data. The significance of the correlation between catalogs is evaluated by comparing the results with simulations of synthetic populations. A strong correlation emerges between Fermi-LAT unidentified sources and HII regions which trace massive SCs in the earliest (&lt; 1-2 Myr) phase of their life, where no supernova explosions have happened yet, confirming that winds of massive stars can alone accelerate particles and produce gamma-ray emission at least up to GeV energies. The association with TeV-energies sources is less evident. Similarly, no significant association is found between Gaia SCs and GeV nor TeV sources. We ascribe this fact to the larger extension of these objects, but also to an intrinsic bias in the Gaia selection towards SCs surrounded by a lower target gas density, that would otherwise hinder the detection in the optical waveband.</description>

      <title>Optical observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and H II region G159.2+3.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We present multi-wavelength observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and the H II region G159.2+3.3 apparently projected nearby, in order to study their properties and potential physical connections. Results. HB9 is bright in $\gamma$-rays, but the $\gamma$-ray morphology is centrally filled and most of it is not clearly associated with the surrounding molecular clouds. There is a weak apparent connection of HB9 to the IR bright enclosing shell of G159.2+3.3 in $\gamma$-ray. The diffuse Balmer line has almost identical morphology as the radio emission in G159.2+3.3, indicating they two are thermal in origin. Using medium-band high-resolution optical spectra from selected regions of the southeast (SE) shell of HB9 and G159.2+3.3, we found the radial velocity dispersion of HB9 along the slit is significantly higher than the FWHM of the lines. In contrast, these two values are both smaller and comparable to each other in G159.2+3.3. This indicates that the gas in HB9 may have additional global motion triggered by the SNR shock. The [N II] $\lambda$6583A/H$\alpha$ line ratio of both objects can be interpreted with photo-ionisation by hot stars or low velocity shocks, except for the post-shock region in the SE shell of HB9, where the elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggests contribution from shock ionisation. The measured electron density from the [S II] 6716/6730 line ratio is significantly lower in the brighter G159.2+3.3 compared to the SE shell of HB9. Conclusions. Our density estimate suggests that G159.2+3.3, although appearing brighter and more compact, is likely located at a much larger distance than HB9, so the two objects have no physical connections, unless the shock compressed gas in HB9 has a significantly lower filling factor.</description>

      <title>A proposed deep sea Neutrino Observatory in the Nanhai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past ten years, several breakthroughs have been made in multi-messenger astronomy. Thanks to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the detection of astrophysical neutrinos was proved to be practical. However, no source has been significantly identified due to the lack of statistics and uncovered field of view. The next generation of high-energy neutrino telescope is in high demand. We propose the NEutrino Observatory in the Nanhai (NEON), located in the South China Sea to be complementary for the global neutrino detectors. This proposal describes the design and layout of the array and reports on comprehensive simulations conducted to assess its performance. The NEON project, with a volume of 10 km$^3$, achieves an angular resolution of 0.1$^\circ$ at 100 TeV. With 10 years of operation, the project's 5$\sigma$ sensitivity is estimated as $E^2\Phi \sim 2 \times 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for a source spectrum index of -2. We found that the variation in depth from 1700 to 3500 meters does not significantly influence the sensitivity to steady sources.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Millicharged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense environment of the supernova core serves as an extraordinary factory for new feebly-interacting particles. Low-energy supernovae, a class of supernovae with low explosion energy, are particularly intriguing due to their stringent constraints on the energy transfer caused by new particles from the supernova core to the mantle. We investigate low-energy supernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production channels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation processes. We find that the electron-positron annihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged particles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. By studying the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings with protons in the supernova mantle, we find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent constraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\sim(10-200)$ MeV, surpassing the energy loss limit from SN1987A by nearly one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Galactic Gas Models Strongly Affect the Determination of the Diffusive Halo Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The height of the Milky Way diffusion halo, above which cosmic-rays can freely escape the galaxy, is among the most critical, yet poorly known, parameters in cosmic-ray physics. Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such as $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive volume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated significant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with theoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought to dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the imprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our ability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the diffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art spiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics and Nucleosynthesis of Jet-Driven Supernovae II: Comparisons with Abundances of Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies and Constraints on Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectra of several galaxies, including extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) from the EMPRESS survey, have shown that the abundances of some Si-group elements differ from "spherical" explosion models of massive stars. This leads to the speculation that these galaxies have experienced supernova explosions with high asphericity, where mixing and fallback of the inner ejecta with the outer material leads to the distinctive chemical compositions. In this article, we consider the jet-driven supernova models by direct two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations using progenitors about 20 -- 25 $M_{\odot}$ at zero metallicity. We investigate how the abundance patterns depend on the progenitor mass, mass cut and the asphericity of the explosion. We compare the observable with available supernova and galaxy catalogs based on $^{56}$Ni, ejecta mass, and individual element ratios. The proximity of our results with the observational data signifies the importance of aspherical supernova explosions in chemical evolution of these galaxies. Our models will provide the theoretical counterpart for understanding the chemical abundances of high-z galaxies measured by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry) and from aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS, which can lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption/scattering) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. In massive progenitors hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s, whereas our calculated neutrino kicks reach (55-140) km/s (estimated upper bounds of (170-265) km/s) and only about (10-50) km/s, if LESA is the main cause of asymmetric neutrino emission. Therefore hydrodynamic NS kicks dominate in explosions of high-mass progenitors, whereas LESA-induced neutrino kicks dominate for NSs born in low-energy SNe of the lowest-mass progenitors, when these explode nearly spherically. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar with its velocity of about 160 km/s, if born in the low-energy explosion of a low-mass, single-star progenitor, should have received a hydrodynamic kick in a considerably asymmetric explosion. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric study to constrain accretion-ejection properties of MCG-5-23-16 using IXPE and NuSTAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the X-ray polarization properties of MCG-5-23-16 by analyzing long-term monitoring data from {\it NuSTAR} jointly with {\it IXPE} observations made in May and November 2022. The re-analysis of {\it IXPE} data gives model-dependent polarization degree, PD (\%) = $1.08\pm0.66$ in the energy band $2-8$ keV. The model-independent analysis of PD poses an upper limit of $\leq3.8$ ($1\sigma$ level) for the same energy band. The observed upper limit of PD, along with broadband spectral analysis ($2-79$ keV) using an accretion-ejection based model, allowed us to derive the corona geometry (i.e. radius and height) and the accretion disk inclination ($\sim 33^\circ$). Additional {\it NuSTAR} observations were also analyzed to gain insights into the accretion flow properties of the source and to estimate the expected polarization during those epochs with PD $\sim 4.3\%$. The radius and height of the corona varies between $28.2\pm3.1 - 39.8\pm4.6$ r$_s$ and $14.3\pm1.7-21.4\pm1.9$ r$_s$ respectively, with a mass outflow rate from the corona measuring $0.14\pm0.03-0.2\pm0.03$ Eddington rate ($\dot m_{\rm Edd}$). The spectral analysis further provided an estimate for the mass of the central black hole $\sim 2\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ and the velocity of the outflowing gas $\sim 0.16-0.19c$. A comparative broadband spectral study using reflection-based models estimates the disk inclination between $\sim 31^\circ\pm8^\circ-45^\circ\pm7^\circ$, and yields an expected PD of 3.4-6.0\%. The expected PD measured using accretion-ejection and reflection models is less compared to the expected PD measured for a given disk inclination of $45^\circ$. Our modeling of the disk-corona-outflows and polarization connection can be extended and validated with data from the recently launched \textit{XPoSat}, India's first X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, offering potential applications to other sources.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: Faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Prompt Emission From Long Gamma Ray Burst Simulations -- III. X-ray Spectropolarimetry</title>

Abstract: While Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) have the potential to shed light on the astrophysics of jets, compact objects, and cosmology, a major set back in their use as probes of these phenomena stems from our incomplete knowledge surrounding their prompt emission. There are numerous models that can account for various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges due to the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase agreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can test future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate the X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model for two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and time-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations, shedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt emission signatures. Our results show that the $T_{90}$ derived from the X-ray lightcurve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is active. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed characteristics of the Einstein Probe detected GRB240315C. Based on our simulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the prompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the prompt emission.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency polarimetry of High-Synchrotron Peaked blazars probes the shape of their jets</title>

Abstract: Multifrequency polarimetry is emerging as a powerful probe of blazar jets, especially due to the advent of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) space observatory. We study the polarization of High-Synchrotron Peaked (HSP) blazars, where both optical and X-ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation from a population of non-thermal electrons. We adopt an axisymmetric stationary force-free jet model, where the electromagnetic fields are determined by the jet shape. When the jet is nearly parabolic, the X-ray polarization degree is $\Pi_{\rm X}\sim 15-50\%$, and the optical polarization degree is $\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 5-25\%$. The polarization degree is strongly chromatic, as $\Pi_{\rm X}/\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 2-9$. The chromaticity is due to the softening of the electron distribution at high energies, and is much stronger than for a uniform magnetic field. The Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) is aligned with the projection of the jet axis on the plane of the sky. These results compare very well with multifrequency polarimetric observations of HSP blazars. Instead, when the jet is nearly cylindrical, the polarization degree is large and weakly chromatic (we find $\Pi_{\rm X}\sim 70\%$ and $\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 60\%$, close to the expected values for a uniform magnetic field). The EVPA is perpendicular to the projection of the jet axis on the plane of the sky. Then, a cylindrical geometry is practically ruled out by current observations. The polarization degree and the EVPA may be less sensitive to the specific particle acceleration process (e.g.,~magnetic reconnection or shocks) than previously thought.</description>

      <title>eROSITA (eRASS1) study of the Canis Major overdensity: Developing a multi-wavelength algorithm for classifying faint X-ray sources</title>

Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is an elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity located at l = -240, b = -80. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. We develop a correlated Bayesian model mixing approach that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. In the present implementation, this mixed EOS is informed solely by those of $\chi$EFT and pQCD, together with the associated truncation errors. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low-density and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated pointwise mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>
