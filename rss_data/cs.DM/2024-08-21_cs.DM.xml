      <title>On the Cop Number of String Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cops and Robber is a well-studied two-player pursuit-evasion game played on a graph, where a group of cops tries to capture the robber. The \emph{cop number} of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber. Gaven\v{c}iak et al.~[Eur. J. of Comb. 72, 45--69 (2018)] studied the game on intersection graphs and established that the cop number for the class of string graphs is at most 15, and asked as an open question to improve this bound for string graphs and subclasses of string graphs. We address this question and establish that the cop number of a string graph is at most 13. To this end, we develop a novel \textit{guarding} technique. We further establish that this technique can be useful for other Cops and Robber games on graphs admitting a representation. In particular, we show that four cops have a winning strategy for a variant of Cops and Robber, named Fully Active Cops and Robber, on planar graphs, addressing an open question of Gromovikov et al.~[Austr. J. Comb. 76(2), 248--265 (2020)]. In passing, we also improve the known bounds on the cop number of boxicity 2 graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation Ratio of the $k$-Opt and Lin-Kernighan Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12755v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-Opt and Lin-Kernighan algorithm are two of the most important local search approaches for the Metric TSP. Both start with an arbitrary tour and make local improvements in each step to get a shorter tour. We show that for any fixed $k\geq 3$ the approximation ratio of the $k$-Opt algorithm for Metric TSP is $O(\sqrt[k]{n})$. Assuming the Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture, we prove a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt[k]{n})$. Unconditionally, we obtain matching bounds for $k=3,4,6$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\frac{2}{3k-3}})$. Our most general bounds depend on the values of a function from extremal graph theory and are tight up to a factor logarithmic in the number of vertices unconditionally. Moreover, all the upper bounds also apply to a parameterized generalization of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm with appropriate parameters. We also show that the approximation ratio of $k$-Opt for Graph TSP is $\Omega\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\log\log(n)}\right)$ and $O\left(\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\log\log(n)}\right)^{\log_2(9)+\epsilon}\right)$ for all $\epsilon&gt;0$. For the (1,2)-TSP we give a lower bound of $\frac{11}{10}$ on the approximation ratio of the $k$-improv and $k$-Opt algorithm for arbitrary fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Cops and robbers pebbling in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we merge the two fields of Cops and Robbers and Graph Pebbling to introduce the new topic of Cops and Robbers Pebbling. Both paradigms can be described by moving tokens (the cops) along the edges of a graph to capture a special token (the robber). In Cops and Robbers, all tokens move freely, whereas, in Graph Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens disappear with movement while the robber is stationary. In Cops and Robbers Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens (cops) disappear with movement, while the robber moves freely. We define the cop pebbling number of a graph to be the minimum number of cops necessary to capture the robber in this context, and present upper and lower bounds and exact values, some involving various domination parameters, for an array of graph classes, including paths, cycles, trees, chordal graphs, high girth graphs, and cop-win graphs, as well as graph products. Furthermore we show that the analogous inequality for Graham's Pebbling Conjecture fails for cop pebbling and posit a conjecture along the lines of Meyniel's Cops and Robbers Conjecture that may hold for cop pebbling. We also offer several new problems.</description>

      <title>Isolation of regular graphs and $k$-chromatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. For any integer $k \geq 1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ be the set of regular graphs of degree at least $k-1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$ be the set of graphs whose chromatic number is at least $k$, and let $\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$ be the union of $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. Thus, $k$-cliques are members of both $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. We prove that for each $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, $\frac{m+1}{{k \choose 2} + 2}$ is a best possible upper bound on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{i,k})$ for connected $m$-edge graphs $G$ that are not $k$-cliques. The bound is attained by infinitely many (non-isomorphic) graphs. The proof of the bound depends on determining the graphs attaining the bound. This appears to be a new feature in the literature on isolation. Among the result's consequences are a sharp bound of Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author on the $k$-clique isolation number and a sharp bound on the cycle isolation number.</description>

      <title>Isolation of squares in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. The second author showed that if $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of cycles and $G$ is a connected $n$-vertex graph that is not a triangle, then $\iota(G,\mathcal{F}) \leq \left \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right \rfloor$. This bound is attainable for every $n$ and solved a problem of Caro and Hansberg. A question that arises immediately is how much smaller an upper bound can be if $\mathcal{F} = \{C_k\}$ for some $k \geq 3$, where $C_k$ is a cycle of length $k$. The problem is to determine the smallest real number $c_k$ (if it exists) such that for some finite set $\mathcal{E}_k$ of graphs, $\iota(G, \{C_k\}) \leq c_k |V(G)|$ for every connected graph $G$ that is not an $\mathcal{E}_k$-graph. The above-mentioned result yields $c_3 = \frac{1}{4}$ and $\mathcal{E}_3 = \{C_3\}$. The second author also showed that if $k \geq 5$ and $c_k$ exists, then $c_k \geq \frac{2}{2k + 1}$. We prove that $c_4 = \frac{1}{5}$ and determine $\mathcal{E}_4$, which consists of three $4$-vertex graphs and six $9$-vertex graphs. The $9$-vertex graphs in $\mathcal{E}_4$ were fully determined by means of a computer program. A method that has the potential of yielding similar results is introduced.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Complete Geometric Graphs on Dense Point Sets into Plane Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{complete geometric graph} consists of a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, in general position, and all segments (edges) connecting them. It is a well known question of Bose, Hurtado, Rivera-Campo, and Wood, whether there exists a positive constant $c&lt;1$, such that every complete geometric graph on $n$ points can be partitioned into at most $cn$ plane graphs (that is, noncrossing subgraphs). We answer this question in the affirmative in the special case where the underlying point set $P$ is \emph{dense}, which means that the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distances in $P$ is of the order of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
