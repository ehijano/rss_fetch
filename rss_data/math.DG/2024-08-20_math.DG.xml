      <title>On differential geometry of non-degenerate CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a non-degenerate CR manifold (M,H(M),J) with a given pseudo-Hermitian 1-form {\theta}, and endow the CR distribution H(M) with any Hermitian metric h instead of the Levi form L_{{\theta}}. This induces a natural Riemannian metric g_{h,{\theta}} on M compatible with the structure. The synthetic object (M,{\theta},J,h) will be called a pseudo-Hermitian manifold, which generalizes the usual notion of pseudo-Hermitian manifold (M,{\theta},J,L_{{\theta}}) in the literature. Our purpose is to investigate the differential-geometric aspect of pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. By imitating Hermitian geometry, we find a canonical connection on (M,{\theta},J,h), which generalizes the Tanaka-Webster connection on (M,{\theta},J,L_{{\theta}}). We define the pseudo-K\"ahler 2-form by g_{h,{\theta}} and J; and introduce the notion of a pseudo-K\"ahler manifold, which is an analogue of a K\"ahler manifold. It turns out that (M,{\theta},J,L_{{\theta}}) is pseudo-K\"ahlerian. Using the structure equations of the canonical connection, we derive some curvature and torsion properties of a pseudo-Hermitian manifold, in particular of a pseudo-K\"ahler manifold. Then some known results in Riemannian geometry are generalized to the pseudo-Hermitian case. These results include some Cartan type results. As an application, we give a new proof for the classification of Sasakian space forms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic mean curvature type flow and capillary Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an anisotropic volume-preserving mean curvature type flow for star-shaped anisotropic $\omega_0$-capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space is studied, and the long-time existence and smooth convergence to a capillary Wulff shape are obtained. If the initial hypersurface is strictly convex and Wulff shape satisfies a mild condition, the solution of this flow remains to be strictly convex for all $t&gt;0$ by adopting a new approach applicable to anisotropic capillary setting. Furthermore, we define some suitable quermassintegrals for anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces, which satisfy some monotonicity results along the flow. As applications, we establish an anisotropic capillary isoperimetric inequality for star-shaped anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces and a family of new Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for strictly convex anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Semi-Continuity of the Morse Index for Ricci Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove lower and upper semi-continuity of the Morse index for sequences of gradient Ricci shrinkers which bubble tree converge in the sense of past work by the author and Buzano. Our proofs rely on adapting recent arguments of Workman which were used to study certain sequences of CMC hypersurfaces and were in turn adapted from work on Da Lio-Gianocca-Riviere. Moreover, we are able to refine Workman's methods by using techniques related to polynomially weighted Sobolev spaces. This all also requires us to extend the analysis to handle when the shrinkers we study are non-compact, which we can do due to the availability of a suitable notion of finite weighted volume. Finally, we identify a technical condition which ensures the Morse index of an asymptotically conical shrinker is bounded below by the f-index of its asymptotic cone.</description>

      <title>ABP estimate on metric measure spaces via optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using optimal transport theory, we establish a sharp Alexandroff--Bakelman--Pucci (ABP) type estimate on metric measure spaces with synthetic Riemannian Ricci curvature lower bounds, and prove some geometric and functional inequalities including a functional ABP estimate. Our result not only extends the border of ABP estimate, but also provides an effective substitution of Jacobi fields computation in the non-smooth framework, which has potential applications to many problems in non-smooth geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Spaces of distributions with Sobolev wave front in a fixed conic set: compactness, pullback by smooth maps and the compensated compactness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the space $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ of distributional sections of the smooth complex vector bundle $E\rightarrow M$ whose Sobolev wave front set of order $r\in\mathbb{R}$ lies in the closed conic subset $L$ of $T^*M\backslash0$. We introduce a locally convex topology on it to study the continuity of the pullback by smooth maps and generalise the result of H\"ormander about the pullback on the space of distributions with $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ wave front set in $L$. We employ an idea of G\'erard [18] to extend the Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness theorem to $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ and we characterise its relatively compact subsets. We study the continuity properties of pseudo-differential operators when acting on $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$, $r\in\mathbb{R}$, and we generalise the Rellich's lemma. As an application of our results, we extend the microlocal defect measures of G\'erard and Tartar to sequences in $\mathcal{D}'^0_L(M;E)$ and we show a microlocal variant of the compensated compactness theorem.</description>

Abstract: We derive a concavity inequality for $k$-Hessian operators under the semi-convexity condition. As an application, we establish interior estimates for semi-convex solutions of the $k$-Hessian equations with vanishing Dirichlet boundary and obtain a Liouville-type result. Additionally, we provide new and simple proofs of Guan-Ren-Wang's results on global curvature estimates for $k$-curvature equations.</description>

      <title>The $C^3$-null gluing problem: linear and nonlinear analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $C^3$-null gluing problem for the Einstein vacuum equations, that is, we consider the null gluing of up to and including third-order derivatives of the metric. In the regime where the characteristic data is close to Minkowski data, we show that this $C^3$-null gluing problem is solvable up to a $20$-dimensional space of obstructions. The obstructions correspond to $20$ linearly conserved quantities: $10$ of which are already present in the $C^2$-null gluing problem analysed by Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, and $10$ are novel obstructions inherent to the $C^3$-null gluing problem. The $10$ novel obstructions are linearly conserved charges calculated from third-order derivatives of the metric.</description>

      <title>New low-genus desingularizations of three Clifford tori and related characterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each nonnegative integer $m$ we construct in the round three-sphere a closed embedded minimal surface of genus $48m+25$ which can be interpreted as a desingularization of the union of three Clifford tori intersecting pairwise orthogonally, along a total of six great circles. Each such surface is generated, under the action of a group of symmetries, by a disc with hexagonal boundary, all of whose sides are contained in great circles. We prove a uniqueness result for this disc, and, as a corollary, we characterize these surfaces. This characterization implies that similar surfaces we constructed for sufficiently high $m$ by gluing methods, in an earlier article, coincide with the ones here. For low $m$ the surfaces constructed here are new. Similarly, we prove uniqueness of the generating discs for one of two families constructed by Choe and Soret (namely the surfaces they call odd) and show that these surfaces also coincide, when of sufficiently high genus, with surfaces we have constructed by gluing.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian curvature identities on almost Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold and generalized Ricci solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold the Nijenhuis tensor is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. If the torsion is closed then the space is a compact generalized gradient Ricci soliton. In this case, the torsion connection is Ricci-flat if and only if either the norm of the torsion or the Riemannian scalar curvature is constant. On a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold it is shown that the curvature of the torsion connection is symmetric on exchange of the first and the second pairs and has vanishing Ricci tensor if and only if it satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler Solitons, Contact Structures, and Isoparametric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLet $(M, g, f, J, \lambda)$ be a complete K\"{a}hler gradient Ricci soliton. In real dimension four, all currently known examples are toric and the symmetry is intrinsically related to the potential function $f$ and the scalar curvature $\SS$. Another article addresses the case that $f$ and $\SS$ are functionally independent. In this one, we consider the dependence case and deduce the symmetry and a complete classification accordingly. Specifically, integral curves of $\nabla f$ are reparamertrized geodesics and this property is closely related to the notion of isoparametric functions. Our first theorem concludes that the soliton must be either a product metric or of cohomogeneity one with deformed homogeneous Sasakian orbits. The second is a partially reverse statement in any dimension. Suppose that each regular level set of $f$ is a deformed contact metric structure then the soliton is totally determined by a regular Sasakian model, which is a Riemannian submersion over a K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold. In particular, $f$ must be isoparametric. An important ingredient of the proof is a characterization of a deformed Sasakian structure which generalizes a classical result.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler Soliton Surfaces Are Generically Toric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M, g, \omega, f, \lambda)$ be a K\"{a}hler gradient Ricci soliton in real dimension four. One first observes that it is an integrable Hamiltonian system in a classical sense. Indeed, all known complete examples are toric and the symmetry is intrinsically related to the potential function $f$ and the scalar curvature $\SS$. While another article addresses the case that these functions are functionally dependent, this one considers the independent case. The main result states that the soliton admits a toric action under a generic assumption. That is, one assumes that the system is non-degenerate and the potential function $f$ is proper. Then there is an effective, completely integrable Hamiltonian toric $\mathbb{T}^2$- action on $(M, \omega)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the geometry of the limit spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, where we assume lower bounds on the sectional curvatures of manifolds and boundaries and the second fundamental forms of boundaries and an upper diameter bound. We mainly focus on the general case of non inradius collapse/convergence, where inradii of manifolds are uniformly bounded away from zero.In this case, many limit spaces have wild geometry, which arise from the boundary behavior of manifolds. We determine the infinitesimal and the local structures around the boundary singular points of the limit spaces.We also present some global convergence/collapsing results.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.03857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a variant of Naef's formula for the failure of invariance of the string topology coproduct under homotopy equivalences, using an obstruction class build from the higher homotopy data one can associate to a homotopy equivalence as well as the ``fake diagonal''. The vanishing of our obstruction class can be seen as a way to measure a form of smallness for homotopy equivalences. We show that the same obstruction rules the failure of invariance for a generalisation of the coproduct to higher dimensional loops.</description>
