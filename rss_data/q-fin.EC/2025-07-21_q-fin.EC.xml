      <title>Second-degree Price Discrimination: Theoretical Analysis, Experiment Design, and Empirical Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on theoretical results from the mechanism design literature to analyze empirical models of second-degree price discrimination (2PD). We show that for a random-coefficients discrete choice ("BLP") model to be suitable for studying 2PD, it must capture the covariance between two key random effects: (i) the "baseline" willingness to pay (affecting all product versions), and (ii) the perceived differentiation between versions. We then develop an experimental design that, among other features, identifies this covariance under common data constraints in 2PD environments. We implement this experiment in the field in collaboration with an international airline. Estimating the theoretically motivated empirical model on the experimental data, we demonstrate its applicability to 2PD decisions. We also show that test statistics from our design can enable qualitative inference on optimal 2PD policy even before estimating a demand model. Our methodology applies broadly across second-degree price discrimination settings.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Lobbying Landscape: Insights from Opinion Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13767v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While lobbying has been demonstrated to have an important effect on public opinion and policy making, existing models of opinion formation do not specifically include its effect. In this work we introduce a new model of opinion dynamics where lobbyists can implement complex strategies and are characterised by a finite budget. Individuals update their opinions through a learning process resembling Bayesian learning, but influenced by cognitive biases such as under-reaction and confirmation bias. We study the model numerically and demonstrate rich dynamics both with and without lobbyists. In the presence of lobbying, we observe two regimes: one in which lobbyists can have full influence on the agent network, and another where the peer-effect generates polarisation. When symmetric lobbyists are present, the lobbyist influence regime is characterised by long opinion oscillations, while in the transition area between the two regimes we observe convergence to the optimistic model when the lobbying influence is long enough. These rich dynamics pave the way for studying real lobbying strategies to validate the model in practice.</description>

      <title>Choosing and Using Information in Evaluation Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a controlled experiment to study how information acquisition impacts candidate evaluations. We provide evaluators with group-level information on performance and the opportunity to acquire additional, individual-level performance information before making a final evaluation. We find that, on average, evaluators under-acquire individual-level information, leading to more stereotypical evaluations of candidates. Consistent with stereotyping, we find that (irrelevant) group-level comparisons have a significant impact on how candidates are evaluated; group-level comparisons bias initial assessments, responses to information, and final evaluations. This leads to under-recognition of talented candidates from comparatively weaker groups and over-selection of untalented candidates from comparatively stronger groups.</description>

      <title>Stablecoins: Fundamentals, Emerging Issues, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins, with a capitalization exceeding 200 billion USD as of January 2025, have shown significant growth, with annual transaction volumes exceeding 10 trillion dollars in 2023 and nearly doubling that figure in 2024. This exceptional success has attracted the attention of traditional financial institutions, with an increasing number of governments exploring the potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Although academia has recognized the importance of stablecoins, research in this area remains fragmented, incomplete, and sometimes contradictory. In this paper, we aim to address the cited gap with a structured literature analysis, correlating recent contributions to present a picture of the complex economic, technical, and regulatory aspects of stablecoins. To achieve this, we formulate the main research questions and categorize scientific contributions accordingly, identifying main results, data sources, methodologies, and open research questions. The research questions we address in this survey paper cover several topics, such as the stability of various stablecoins, novel designs and implementations, and relevant regulatory challenges. The studies employ a wide range of methodologies and data sources, which we critically analyze and synthesize. Our analysis also reveals significant research gaps, including limited studies on security and privacy, underexplored stablecoins, unexamined failure cases, unstudied governance mechanisms, and the treatment of stablecoins under financial accounting standards, among other areas.</description>

      <title>Impact Evaluations in Data Poor Settings: The Case of Stress-Tolerant Rice Varieties in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New technologies are sometimes introduced at times or in places that lack the necessary data to conduct a well-identified impact evaluation. We develop a methodology that combines Earth observation (EO) data and advances in machine learning with administrative and survey data so as to allow researchers to conduct impact evaluations when traditional economic data is missing. To demonstrate our method, we study stress tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) first introduced to Bangladesh 15 years ago. Using EO data on rice production and flooding for the entire country, spanning two decades, we find evidence of STRV effectiveness. We highlight how the nature of the technology, which is only effective under a specific set of circumstances, creates a Goldilocks Problem that EO data is particularly well suited to addressing. Our findings speak to the promises and challenges of using EO data to conduct impact evaluations in data poor settings.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Bribery, Technology Choice, and Capital Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production, entry, and technological decisions of firms in the presence of bribery. We find that bribery can be justified even in the absence of bureaucratic inefficiencies. We document substantial technology-specific heterogeneity in bribery in 148 countries and incorporate it into a general equilibrium model, where firms use capital-intensive or labor-intensive technology. When bribery more heavily affects less efficient labor-intensive firms, resources move toward more efficient capital-intensive firms, resulting in higher capital accumulation and aggregate output. In poorer countries, the elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 18.7% more and the aggregate output by 3.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. In wealthier countries, the elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 44.4% more and the aggregate output by 15.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. Our findings challenge the established view of bribery as uniformly harmful and demonstrate how the within-country heterogeneity in bribery can explain cross-country differences in income.</description>

      <title>Where do Germany's electricity imports come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Germany's electricity trade balance shifted from net exports to net imports for the first time since 2002, resulting in an increasing discussion of these imports in the public debate. This study discusses different data driven approaches for the analysis of Germany's cross-border trade, with a focus on the methodological challenges to determine the origin of imported electricity within the framework of European electricity market coupling. While scheduled commercial flows from ENTSO-E are often used as indicators, generally these do not correspond to bilateral exchanges between different market actors. In particular, for day-ahead market coupling only net positions have an economically reasonable interpretation, and scheduled commercial exchanges are defined through ex-post algorithmic calculations. Any measure of the origin of electricity imports thus depends on some underlying interpretation and corresponding method, ranging from local flow patterns to correlations in net positions. To illustrate this dependence on methodological choices, we compare different approaches to determine the origin of electricity imports for hourly European power system data for 2024.</description>
