      <title>Protein Structure Tokenization: Benchmarking and New Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.</description>

      <title>BixBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM-based Agents in Computational Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>RecCrysFormer: Refined Protein Structural Prediction from 3D Patterson Maps via Recycling Training Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining protein structures at an atomic level remains a significant challenge in structural biology. We introduce $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$, a hybrid model that exploits the strengths of transformers with the aim of integrating experimental and ML approaches to protein structure determination from crystallographic data. $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ leverages Patterson maps and incorporates known standardized partial structures of amino acid residues to directly predict electron density maps, which are essential for constructing detailed atomic models through crystallographic refinement processes. $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ benefits from a ``recycling'' training regimen that iteratively incorporates results from crystallographic refinements and previous training runs as additional inputs in the form of template maps. Using a preliminary dataset of synthetic peptide fragments based on Protein Data Bank, $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ achieves good accuracy in structural predictions and shows robustness against variations in crystal parameters, such as unit cell dimensions and angles.</description>

      <title>T-cell receptor specificity landscape revealed through de novo peptide design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-cells play a key role in adaptive immunity by mounting specific responses against diverse pathogens. An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) mediate an immune response. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T-cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC class I alleles, and to design novel immunogenic peptides for specified TCR-MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based, physics-guided machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, the implicit physical reasoning in HERMES enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR-pMHC binding affinities and T-cell activities across diverse viral epitopes and cancer neoantigens, achieving up to 72% correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR-MHC systems targeting viral and cancer peptides, we demonstrate that our designs--with up to five substitutions from the native sequence--activate T-cells at success rates of up to 50%. Lastly, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR-MHC complexes, offering key insights into T-cell specificity in both humans and mice. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, opening new computational paths for T-cell vaccine development against viruses and cancer.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approaches for the decomposition of reaction networks and the determination of existence and number of steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction network theory provides powerful tools for rigorously understanding chemical reactions and the dynamical systems and differential equations that represent them. A frequent issue with mathematical analyses of these networks is the reliance on explicit parameter values which in many cases cannot be determined experimentally. This can make analyzing a dynamical system infeasible, particularly when the size of the system is large. One approach is to analyze subnetworks of the full network and use the results for a full analysis.
  Our focus is on the equilibria of reaction networks. Gr\"obner basis computation is a useful approach for solving the polynomial equations which correspond to equilibria of a dynamical system. We identify a class of networks for which Gr\"obner basis computations of subnetworks can be used to reconstruct the more expensive Gr\"obner basis computation of the whole network. We compliment this result with tools to determine if a steady state can exist, and if so, how many.</description>

      <title>Redefining spectral unmixing for in-vivo brain tissue analysis from hyperspectral imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting molecular tumor biomarkers from hyperspectral imaging (HSI), an emerging technology for intraoperative tissue assessment. To achieve this, we employ spectral unmixing, allowing to decompose the spectral signals recorded by the HSI camera into their constituent molecular components. Traditional unmixing approaches are based on physical models that establish a relationship between tissue molecules and the recorded spectra. However, these methods commonly assume a linear relationship between the spectra and molecular content, which does not capture the whole complexity of light-matter interaction. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel unmixing procedure that allows to take into account non-linear optical effects while preserving the computational benefits of linear spectral unmixing. We validate our methodology on an in-vivo brain tissue HSI dataset and demonstrate that the extracted molecular information leads to superior classification performance.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Fusion of MRI and Jacobian Maps for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Structural MRI (sMRI) is widely used for AD diagnosis, but conventional deep learning approaches primarily rely on intensity-based features, which require large datasets to capture subtle structural changes. Jacobian determinant maps (JSM) provide complementary information by encoding localized brain deformations, yet existing multimodal fusion strategies fail to fully integrate these features with sMRI. We propose a cross-attention fusion framework to model the intrinsic relationship between sMRI intensity and JSM-derived deformations for AD classification. Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we compare cross-attention, pairwise self-attention, and bottleneck attention with four pre-trained 3D image encoders. Cross-attention fusion achieves superior performance, with mean ROC-AUC scores of 0.903 (+/-0.033) for AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and 0.692 (+/-0.061) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. CN. Despite its strong performance, our model remains highly efficient, with only 1.56 million parameters--over 40 times fewer than ResNet-34 (63M) and Swin UNETR (61.98M). These findings demonstrate the potential of cross-attention fusion for improving AD diagnosis while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Encounter-based model of a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic resetting on an encounter-based model of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined to the half-line $[0,\infty)$ with a partially absorbing wall at $x=0$. The RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha$ between the velocity states $\pm v$ with $v&gt;0$. Absorption occurs when the number of collisions with the wall (discrete local time) exceeds a randomly generated threshold $\widehat{\ell}$ with probability distribution $\Psi(\ell)$. The extended RTP model has three state variables, namely, particle position $X(t)\in [0,\infty)$, the velocity direction $\sigma(t)\in\{-1, 1\}$, and the discrete local time $L(t)\in {\mathbb N}$. We initially assume that only $X(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ reset at a Poisson rate $r$, whereas $L(t)$ is not changed. This implies that resetting is not governed by a renewal process. We use the stochastic calculus of jump processes to derive an evolution equation for the joint probability distribution of the triplet $(X(t),\sigma(t),L(t))$. This is then used to calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) by performing a discrete Laplace transform of the evolution equation with respect to the local time. We thus find that the MFPT's only dependence on the distribution $\Psi$ is via the mean local time threshold. We also identify parameter regimes in which the MFPT is a unimodal function of both the resetting and tumbling rates. Finally, we consider conditions under which resetting is given by a renewal process and show how the MFPT in the presence of local time resetting depends on the full statistics of $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Learning Surrogate Equations for the Analysis of an Agent-Based Cancer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt a two species agent-based cancer model that describes the interaction between cancer cells and healthy cells on a uniform grid to include the interaction with a third species -- namely immune cells. We run six different scenarios to explore the competition between cancer and immune cells and the initial concentration of the immune cells on cancer dynamics. We then use coupled equation learning to construct a population-based reaction model for each scenario. We show how they can be unified into a single surrogate population-based reaction model, whose underlying three coupled ordinary differential equations are much easier to analyse than the original agent-based model. As an example, by finding the single steady state of the cancer concentration, we are able to find a linear relationship between this concentration and the initial concentration of the immune cells. This then enables us to estimate suitable values for the competition and initial concentration to reduce the cancer substantially without performing additional complex and expensive simulations from an agent-based stochastic model. The work shows the importance of performing equation learning from agent-based stochastic data for gaining key insights about the behaviour of complex cellular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Open-radiomics: A Collection of Standardized Datasets and a Technical Protocol for Reproducible Radiomics Machine Learning Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: As an important branch of machine learning pipelines in medical imaging, radiomics faces two major challenges namely reproducibility and accessibility. In this work, we introduce open-radiomics, a set of radiomics datasets along with a comprehensive radiomics pipeline based on our proposed technical protocol to improve the reproducibility of the results. Methods: We curated large-scale radiomics datasets based on three open-source datasets; BraTS 2020 for high-grade glioma (HGG) versus low-grade glioma (LGG) classification and survival analysis, BraTS 2023 for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase classification, and non-small cell lung cancer survival analysis from the Cancer Imaging Archive. Using BraTS 2020 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset, we applied our protocol to 369 brain tumor patients (76 LGG, 293 HGG). Leveraging PyRadiomics for LGG vs. HGG classification, we generated 288 datasets from 4 MRI sequences, 3 binWidths, 6 normalization methods, and 4 tumor subregions. Random Forest classifiers were trained and validated (60%,20%,20%) across 100 different data splits (28,800 test results), evaluating Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). Results: Unlike binWidth and image normalization, tumor subregion and imaging sequence significantly affected performance of the models. T1 contrast-enhanced sequence and the union of Necrotic and the non-enhancing tumor core subregions resulted in the highest AUROCs (average test AUROC 0.951, 95% confidence interval of (0.949, 0.952)). Although several settings and data splits (28 out of 28800) yielded test AUROC of 1, they were irreproducible. Conclusion: Our experiments demonstrate the sources of variability in radiomics pipelines (e.g., tumor subregion) can have a significant impact on the results, which may lead to superficial perfect performances that are irreproducible.</description>

      <title>Atomas: Hierarchical Alignment on Molecule-Text for Unified Molecule Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields. However, most approaches employ a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities that may fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecule-and-text fragments and stereoisomeric nuances, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable of modeling such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to the lack of annotations about the fine-grained fragments in the existing dataset. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a hierarchical molecular representation learning framework that jointly learns representations from SMILES strings and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to automatically learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations at three semantic levels. Atomas's end-to-end training framework supports understanding and generating molecules, enabling a wider range of downstream tasks. Atomas achieves superior performance across 12 tasks on 11 datasets, outperforming 11 baseline models thus highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of our method. Scaling experiments further demonstrate Atomas's robustness and scalability. Moreover, visualization and qualitative analysis, validated by human experts, confirm the chemical relevance of our approach. Codes are released on https://github.com/yikunpku/Atomas.</description>

      <title>Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. This paper presents a comprehensive review of three interconnected digital aquaculture tasks, namely, fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis, using a novel and unified approach. Unlike previous reviews which focused on single modalities or individual tasks, we analyse vision-based (i.e. image- and video-based), acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods across all three tasks. We examine their advantages, limitations, and applications, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical cross-cutting research gaps. The review also includes emerging ideas such as applying multi-task learning and large language models to address various aspects of fish monitoring, an approach not previously explored in aquaculture literature. We identify the major obstacles hindering research progress in this field, including the scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards. To overcome the current limitations, we explore the potential of using emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning to improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of integrated fish monitoring systems. In addition, we provide a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. This holistic perspective offers a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and to promote their practical implementations in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal and Multi-Attribute Generation of Single Cells with CFGen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data is crucial for tasks like trajectory inference, batch effect removal, and simulation of realistic cellular data. However, recent deep generative models simulating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, overlooking the discrete nature of single-cell data, which limits their effectiveness and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Additionally, aspects like controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation of cellular data remain underexplored. This work introduces CellFlow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model that preserves the inherent discreteness of single-cell data. CFGen generates whole-genome multi-modal single-cell data reliably, improving the recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while tackling relevant generative tasks such as rare cell type augmentation and batch correction. We also introduce a novel framework for compositional data generation using Flow Matching. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.</description>

      <title>Penalized Principal Component Analysis Using Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13838</link>

Abstract: Principal components computed via PCA (principal component analysis) are traditionally used to reduce dimensionality in genomic data or to correct for population stratification. In this paper, we explore the penalized eigenvalue problem (PEP) which reformulates the computation of the first eigenvector as an optimization problem and adds an $L_1$ penalty constraint to enforce sparseness of the solution. The contribution of our article is threefold. First, we extend PEP by applying smoothing to the original LASSO-type $L_1$ penalty. This allows one to compute analytical gradients which enable faster and more efficient minimization of the objective function associated with the optimization problem. Second, we demonstrate how higher order eigenvectors can be calculated with PEP using established results from singular value decomposition (SVD). Third, we present four experimental studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the smoothed penalized eigenvectors. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our proposed smoothed PEP allows one to increase numerical stability and obtain meaningful eigenvectors. We also employ the penalized eigenvector approach in two additional real data applications (computation of a polygenic risk score and clustering), demonstrating that exchanging the penalized eigenvectors for their smoothed counterparts can increase prediction accuracy in polygenic risk scores and enhance discernibility of clusterings. Moreover, we compare our proposed smoothed PEP to seven state-of-the-art algorithms for sparse PCA and evaluate the accuracy of the obtained eigenvectors, their support recovery, and their runtime.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Controlled Traversing of the Attractor Landscape of Boolean Models in the Context of Cellular Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular reprogramming can be used for both the prevention and cure of different diseases. However, the efficiency of discovering reprogramming strategies with classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we develop a novel computational framework based on deep reinforcement learning that facilitates the identification of reprogramming strategies. For this aim, we formulate a control problem in the context of cellular reprogramming for the frameworks of BNs and PBNs under the asynchronous update mode. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a pseudo-attractor and a procedure for identification of pseudo-attractor state during training. Finally, we devise a computational framework for solving the control problem, which we test on a number of different models.</description>
