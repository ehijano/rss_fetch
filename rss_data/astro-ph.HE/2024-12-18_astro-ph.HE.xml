      <title>Pauli blocking: probing beyond-mean-field effects in neutrino flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated relying on the mean-field approximation. However, it remains to be understood whether mean-field corrections could hinder flavor instabilities that are otherwise foreseen. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether beyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy can affect the flavor conversion physics. We find that these corrections shift the stability regions for a suite of (anti)neutrino distributions; a configuration of angular distributions that is stable in the mean-field case can become unstable, or the flavor conversion of previously unstable ensembles can be damped. Our work should serve as a motivation for further understanding the limitations of the mean-field treatment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Peaked Non-Thermal Light Curves from Magnetar-Powered Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars can both create millisecond magnetars. Such magnetars are candidate engines to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The non-thermal light curve of the resulting transients can exhibit multiple components, including: the GRB afterglow, pulsar wind nebula (PWN), and ejecta afterglow. We derive the timescales for the peak of each component and show that the PWN is detectable at radio frequencies, dominating the emission for $\sim$ 6 years for supernova/long GRBs (SN/LGRBs) and $\sim$ 100 days for kilonova/short GRBs (KN/SGRBs) at 1 GHz, and $\sim$ 1 year for SN/LGRBs and $\sim$ 15 days for KN/SGRBs at 100 GHz. The PWN emission has an exponential, frequency-dependent rise to peak that cannot be replicated by an ejecta afterglow. We show that PWNe in SN/LGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.06$ with current instruments and $z \sim 0.3$ with next-generation instruments and PWNe in KN/SGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.3$ with current instruments and $z \sim 1.5$ with next-generation instruments. We find that the optimal strategy for detecting PWNe in these systems is a multi-band, high cadence radio follow-up of nearby KN/SGRBs with an x-ray plateau or extended prompt emission from 10 - 100 days post-burst.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Correlations and Biases in Parameter Inference from Neutron-Star Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of X-ray pulse profiles from millisecond pulsars offers a promising method of inferring the mass-to-radius ratios of neutron stars. Recent observations with NICER resulted in measurements of radii for three neutron stars using this technique. In this paper, we explore correlations between model parameters and the degree to which individual parameters can be inferred from pulse profiles, using an analytic model that allows for an efficient and interpretable exploration. We introduce a new set of model parameters that reduce the most prominent correlations and allow for an efficient sampling of posteriors. We then demonstrate that the degree of beaming of radiation emerging from the neutron star surface has a large impact on the uncertainties in the inferred model parameters. Finally, we show that the uncertainties in the model parameters for neutron stars for which the polar cap temperature falls outside of the NICER energy range are significantly degraded.</description>

      <title>A Counterintuitive Correlation Between Neutron-Star Radii Inferred from Pulse Modeling and Surface Emission Beaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by gravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides critical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the focus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to calculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect beaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate that assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a more isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case of two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this counterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with NICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly overestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and equation-of-state constraints.</description>

      <title>Representation learning for fast radio burst dynamic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, with diverse time-frequency patterns and emission properties that require explanation. Since FRBs are only detected in the radio, analyzing their dynamic spectra is crucial to disentangling the physical processes governing their generation and propagation. Furthermore, comparing FRB morphologies provides insights into possible differences among their progenitors and environments. This study applies unsupervised learning and deep learning techniques to investigate FRB dynamic spectra, focusing on two approaches: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) enhanced by an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB) layer. PCA served as a computationally efficient baseline, capturing broad trends, identifying outliers, and providing valuable insights into large datasets. However, its linear nature limited its ability to reconstruct complex, non-linear structures in FRB signals. In contrast, the IOB-augmented CAE demonstrated exceptional performance in capturing intricate burst features, achieving high reconstruction accuracy and robust denoising, even at modest signal-to-noise ratios. The IOB layer's ability to prioritize relevant features enabled efficient data compression, preserving key morphological characteristics with minimal latent variables. When applied to real FRBs from CHIME, the IOB-CAE generalized effectively, revealing a latent space that highlighted the continuum of FRB morphologies and the potential for distinguishing intrinsic differences between burst types. This framework demonstrates that while FRBs may not naturally cluster into discrete groups, advanced representation learning techniques can uncover meaningful structures, offering new insights into the diversity and origins of these bursts.</description>

      <title>High precision spectro-temporal analysis of ultra-fast radio bursts using per-channel arrival times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), especially those from repeating sources, exhibit a rich variety of morphologies in their dynamic spectra (or waterfalls). Characterizing these morphologies and spectro-temporal properties is a key strategy in investigating the underlying unknown emission mechanism of FRBs. This type of analysis has been typically accomplished using two-dimensional Gaussian techniques and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the waterfall. These techniques suffer from high uncertainties when applied to recently observed ultra-FRBs: FRBs that are only a few microseconds long. We present a technique that involves the tagging of per-channel arrival times of an FRB to perform sub-burst slope measurements. This technique leverages the number of frequency channels and can increase the precision of sub-burst slope measurements by several orders of magnitude, allowing it to be easily applied to ultra-FRBs and microshot forests. While scattering and dispersion remain important and often dominating sources of uncertainty in measurements, this technique provides an adaptable and firm foundation for obtaining spectro-temporal properties from all kinds of FRB morphologies. We present measurements using this technique of several hundred bursts across 12 repeating sources, including over 400 bursts from the repeating sources FRB 20121102A, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20200120E, all of which exhibit microsecond-long FRBs, as well as 136 drift rates. In addition to retrieving the known relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, we explore other correlations between burst properties. We find that ultra-FRBs obey the sub-burst slope law along with longer duration bursts, and appear to form a distinct population in the duration-frequency relation.</description>

      <title>Fermi Unassociated Sources in the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 2000 Gamma ray sources identified by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are considered unassociated, meaning that they have no known counterparts in any other frequency regime. We have carried out an image-based search for steep spectrum radio sources, with in-band spectral index less than -1.4, within the error regions of Fermi unassociated sources using 1 to 1.4 GHz radio data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) Data Release. MALS DR1 with a median rms noise of 22 to 25 microJy and 735,649 sources is a significant advance over past image-based searches with improvements in sensitivity, resolution and bandwidth. Steep spectrum candidates were identified using a combination of in-band spectral indices from MALS and existing radio surveys. We developed an optical and infrared source classification scheme in order to distinguish between galactic pulsars and radio galaxies. In total, we identify nine pulsar candidates towards six Fermi sources that are worthy of follow-up for pulsation searches. We also report 41 steep spectrum radio galaxy candidates that may be of interest in searches for high-redshift radio galaxies. We show that MALS due to its excellent continuum sensitivity can detect 80 percent of the known pulsar population. This exhibits the promise of identifying exotic pulsar candidates with future image-based surveys with the Square Kilometre and its precursors.</description>

      <title>Modeling the UV/Optical light curve of re-brightening tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a new subclass of tidal disruption events (TDEs) was reported from the literature. The light curve of these TDEs show a re-brightening feature in the decline phase after the first peak, which then leads to a second flare. The re-brightening TDEs challenges the existing light curve fitting tools, which are designed to handle single flare. In this work, we present a model, aimed at reproducing of the light curve of the re-brightening TDEs, based on the scenario that the consecutive flares are produced by the same star who experienced two partial disruptions (PTDEs). We also develop a fitting code from this model, and apply it to two re-brightening TDEs: AT 2022dbl and AT 2023adr. The light curve of both TDEs are well fitted. Finally, we forecast the time and peak brightness of the next flare for these two TDEs, so that the observers could get prepared in advance and make an examination on our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Seventeenth Marcel Grossman meeting, researchers gathered to discuss significant advances in the study of ultra-long period sources. Presentations covered key aspects, including emission properties, evolutionary scenarios, and models for their emission. In this proceeding, we summarize key observational breakthroughs and touch upon the proposed evolutionary pathways and state-of-the-art models that seek to explain these sources. Finally, we outline future directions, including the potential of ongoing and upcoming surveys, improved detection algorithms, and multiwavelength observations to significantly expand the known population of these mysterious sources.</description>

      <title>The long-short GRB connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to arise from different and unrelated astrophysical progenitors. The association of long GRBs with supernovae (SNe) and the difference in the distributions of galactocentric offsets of long and short GRBs within their host galaxies have often been considered strong evidence of their unrelated origins. Long GRBs have been thought to result from the collapse of single massive stars, while short GRBs come from mergers of compact object binaries. Our present study challenges this conventional view. We demonstrate that the observational properties, such as the association with SNe and the different galactic offsets, are naturally explained within the framework of the binary-driven hypernova model, suggesting an evolutionary connection between long and short GRBs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Low Angular Momentum Advective Flows onto Black Hole and associated observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulation results examining the presence and behavior of standing shocks in zero-energy low angular momentum advective accretion flows and explore their (in)stabilities properties taking into account various specific angular momentum, $\lambda_0$. Within the range $10-50R_g$ (where $R_g$ denotes the Schwarzschild radius), shocks are discernible for $\lambda_0\geq 1.75$. In the special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) simulation when $\lambda_0 = 1.80$, we find the merger of two shocks resulted in a dramatic increase in luminosity. We present the impact of external and internal flow collisions from the funnel region on luminosity. Notably, oscillatory behavior characterizes shocks within $1.70 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. Using free-free emission as a proxy for analysis, we shows that the luminosity oscillations between frequencies of $0.1-10$ Hz for $\lambda_0$ range $1.7 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. These findings offer insights into quasi-periodic oscillations emissions from certain black hole X-ray binaries, exemplified by GX 339-4. Furthermore, for the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center, Sgr A*, oscillation frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$ Hz were observed. This frequency range, translating to one cycle every few days, aligns with observational data from the X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton.</description>

      <title>DA 362: A Gamma-ray Emitting Compact Symmetric Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-ray detection from an astrophysical object indicates the presence of an extreme environment where high-energy radiation is produced. With the continuous monitoring of the Gamma-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), leading to deeper sensitivity, the high-energy Gamma-ray emission has now been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source DA~362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However, it was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based on its sub-kpc, bi-polar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This makes DA~362 the only fourth Gamma-ray emitting object of this enigmatic class of radio-loud AGN. Using five very long baseline interferometry observations covering 1996-2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal ($v_{\rm app}\sim 0.2c$), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT observations revealed a Gamma-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected from the other three Gamma-ray detected CSOs. This object is bright in the near-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-ultraviolet filters, hinting at possible obscuration. The Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA 362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be made due to large uncertainties. We conclude that deeper observations are needed to probe the broadband properties of this enigmatic object and to understand the origin of high-energy Gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter from the center of the Earth with ten years of IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unresolved in fundamental physics. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could explain the nature of dark matter, can be captured by celestial bodies like the Sun or Earth, leading to enhanced self-annihilation into Standard Model particles including neutrinos detectable by neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. This article presents a search for muon neutrinos from the center of the Earth performed with 10 years of IceCube data using a track-like event selection. We considered a number of WIMP annihilation channels ($\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$/$W^+W^-$/$b\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from 10 GeV to 10 TeV. No significant excess over background due to a dark matter signal was found while the most significant result corresponds to the annihilation channel $\chi\chi\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ for the mass $m_{\chi}=250$~GeV with a post-trial significance of $1.06\sigma$. Our results are competitive with previous such searches and direct detection experiments. Our upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP scattering are world-leading among neutrino telescopes for WIMP masses $m_{\chi}&gt;100$~GeV.</description>

      <title>AT 2020nov: Evidence for Disk Reprocessing in a Rare Tidal Disruption Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of AT 2020nov, a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the center of its host galaxy, located at a redshift of $z = 0.083$. AT 2020nov exhibits unique features, including double-peaked Balmer emission lines, a broad UV/optical flare, and a peak log luminosity in the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) estimated at $\sim$$45.66^{+0.10}_{-0.33} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$. A late-time X-ray flare was also observed, reaching an absorbed luminosity of $1.67 \times 10^{43} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ approximately 300 days after the UV/optical peak. Multi-wavelength coverage, spanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex spectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust echoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs. Spectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of $\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \times 10^4 \; \mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component SED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the primary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing the observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the host galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov as a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended pre-existing accretion structure.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Optical and X-ray Emission Evolution of the Oxygen-Rich SN 1996cr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the ejecta of supernovae interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby supernovae provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-supernova evolution. Here we present late-time, multi-epoch optical and Chandra} X-ray spectra of the core-collapse supernova SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in July 2017 and August 2021 show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of $\pm 4500$ km s$^{-1}$. Red-shifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blue-shifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the supernova ejecta. Broad $\pm 2400$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\alpha$ is also seen which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower density environment. Though originally identified as a SN IIn, based upon late time optical emission line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a SN IIb/Ib.</description>

      <title>The PeV Frontier: Status of Gamma-ray astronomy after two decades with H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS and the new window recently opened by HAWC and LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main purposes in $\gamma$-ray astronomy is linked to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. Unlike cosmic rays, $\gamma$ rays can be used to probe their production sites in the Galaxy and to find which type of astrophysical sources is able to accelerated particles up to PeV energies. Twenty years of observations with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS) provided an unprecedented view of the very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray sky and a large variety of Galactic sources which are prominent TeV emitters, such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, massive stellar clusters and binary systems, in addition to a large fraction of unidentified TeV sources. For a long time, supernova remnants were the most promising candidates for the main source of Galactic cosmic rays, but the new window of ultra-high-energy $\gamma$ rays recently opened by HAWC and LHAASO gave unexpected results and demonstrated the need to re-evaluate some scenarios and to revise some of our definitions. The highest-energy $\gamma$-ray sources are not associated with standard candidates for the main source of Galactic cosmic rays and challenged our usual paradigms, highlighting the vastness of what needs to be explored and understood in the next decades.</description>

      <title>What do we know about cosmic rays with energies above 5 EeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays begin to reveal their secrets at energies above 5 EeV. Beyond this characteristic energy, known as the spectral "ankle", the arrival-direction data from the Pierre Auger Observatory show anisotropy on large angular scales of increasing amplitude with energy. This discovery provides observational evidence that cosmic rays beyond the ankle originate outside the Milky Way, as expected from the weak Galactic confinement and the high luminosity required for the sources. Synthetic models of extragalactic source populations emitting fully ionized atoms have allowed us to reproduce the cosmic-ray flux beyond the ankle for almost a decade. These models capture the various slope breaks in the spectrum at ultra-high energies, including the flux suppression at ${\sim}\,$45 EeV and the recently measured feature at ${\sim}\,$15 EeV, known as the spectral "instep". Such slope breaks are understood as changes in nuclear composition, with the average atomic mass increasing with energy. The population of astrophysical sources responsible for accelerating these nuclei remains unidentified, although serious contenders have been identified. Particularly instructive are the latest searches at the highest energies for anisotropies correlated with the flux patterns expected from galaxies outside the Local Group, which are approaching $5\,\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency Probes of the Persistent Radio Sources associated with Repeating FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Persistent Radio Sources (PRSs) associated with three repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has provided insight into the local environments of these FRBs. Here, we present deep radio observations of the fields surrounding three highly active repeating FRBs namely, FRB 20220912A, FRB 20240114A, and FRB 20240619D using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at low radio frequencies. Towards FRB~20240114A, we report the detection of compact source at 650\,MHz with a flux density of 65.6$\pm$8.1\,$\mu$Jy/beam. Our measurements of the spectral index, star formation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the physical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio source (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect radio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy. For FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an associated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with FRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only three other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form of magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at peak nucleation. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Accessing thermonuclear detonation with the shock front induced by the alpha particle deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detonation behaviors during thermonuclear burning indicate a state of robust hot spot burning and are widely present in astronomical phenomena, such as supernovae. In this work, we propose an analytical model including alpha-particle deposition at the shock front, which significantly lowers the detonation threshold. The new temperature threshold is 13.4 keV for the isochoric ignition and 25.1 keV for the isobaric ignition, both of which are more accessible experimentally. When a shock wave is present, alpha-particle deposition occurs at the high-density shock front instead of the cold fuel, accelerating the burning wave by approximately 20%. To further validate these findings, we conducted a series of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations using finite isochoric hot spots with different fast electron energy. The results reveal a rise in burn-up fraction caused by the detonation wave with a deposited fast electron energy about 8.5 kJ. This work can provide a reference for the realization of fusion energy via fast ignition schemes, such as the double-cone ignition scheme. This work also shows the possibility of studying the detonation in astrophysics with laser driven fast ignition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first gravitational wave, GW150914, detected by advanced LIGO and constructed from the data of measurement of strain relative deformation of the fabric of spacetime. We show that the time series from the gravitational wave obeys a nonadditive entropy, and its dynamics evolve with the three associated Tsallis indices named q-triplet. This fact strongly suggests that these black hole merger systems behave in a non-extensive framework. Furthermore, our results point out that the entropic indexes obtained as a function of frequency are proper statistical parameters to determine the dominant frequency when black hole coalescence is achieved.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos carry most of the energy released by a core-collapse supernova. SNOLAB has two neutrino-capable detectors, SNO+ and HALO, that have complementary neutrino flavour sensitivities. SNOLAB is also host to existing facilities, or plans to host future projects, that can enhance sensitivity to these neutrinos. These detectors, together with others worldwide both in existence and planned, will provide insights to a variety of different models using neutrinos from the next galactic supernova.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Feedback from Supernovae in a Stratified Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each supernova's energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy and the rest is thermal. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal. We find that cosmic-ray injections (1) drive a faster vertical motion with more mass, (2) produce a more vertically oriented magnetic field, and (3) increase the scale height of warm gas outside the midplane $(z \gtrsim 0.5\,\mathrm{kpc})$. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $&gt;50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. We also show that the Parker instability leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. Finally, our simulations show that a vertical magnetic field can lead to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing $f(Q)$ Gravity Studies: Observational Cosmology through Deep Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12323v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most exciting elements of cosmology is researching the potential of anisotropy in the early cosmos. We examine the expansion of the cosmos over time using an anisotropic Bianchi type-I spacetime subjected to the $f(Q)$ gravity. We do this by limiting the number of cosmological parameters used. The approach, we used is known as CoLFI, which stands for "Estimating Cosmological Parameters with deep learning." This paper presents a revolutionary deep learning-based technique to the parameter inference. The deep learning methodology clearly outperforms the MCMC method in terms of best-fit values, parameter errors, and correlations between parameters. This is the result of comparing the two different ways. Moreover, we obtained the transition redshift $z_{t} = 0.63$ which leads the transitioning model of the Universe from early deceleration to current acceleration phase. The dynamics of jerk parameter and validation of energy conditions of the model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A second candidate magnetic helium core white dwarf and 3 other variable white dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs ($0.18 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 0.5 \,M_\odot$) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of $5.21 \pm 0.02$ hours, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from $\sim 0.11-0.6$. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars embody the final stable phase of the most massive stars immediately before their evolution is terminated in a supernova explosion. They are responsible for some of the most extreme and energetic phenomena in stellar physics, driving fast and dense stellar winds that are powered by extraordinarily high mass-loss rates arising from their near Eddington limit luminosity. When found in binary systems comprised of two hot wind-driving components, a colliding wind binary (CWB) is formed, manifesting dramatic observational signatures from the radio to X-rays. Among the wealth of rare and exotic phenomenology associated with CWBs, perhaps the most unexpected is the production of copious amounts of warm dust. A necessary condition seems to be one binary component being a carbon-rich WR star -- providing favorable chemistry for dust nucleation from the wind -- however a detailed understanding of the physics underlying this phenomenon has not been established.</description>

      <title>Laboratory modeling of MHD accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Can quasars, triggered by mergers, account for NANOGrav's stochastic gravitational wave background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) recently discovered by several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is consistent with arising from a population of coalescing super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The amplitude of the background is somewhat higher than expected in most previous population models or from the local mass density of SMBHs. SMBHBs are expected to be produced in galaxy mergers, which are also thought to trigger bright quasar activity. Under the assumptions that (i) a fraction $f_{bin} \sim 1$ of all quasars are associated with SMBHB mergers, (ii) the typical quasar lifetime is $t_{Q} \sim 10^{8} yr$, and (iii) adopting Eddington ratios $f_{Edd} \sim 0.3$ for the luminosity of bright quasars, we compute the GWB associated directly with the empirically measured quasar luminosity function (QLF). This approach bypasses the need to model the cosmological evolution of SMBH or galaxy mergers from simulations or semi-analytical models. We find a GWB amplitude approximately matching the value measured by NANOGrav. Our results are consistent with most quasars being associated with SMBH binaries and being the sources of the GWB, and imply a joint constraint on $t_{Q}$, $f_{Edd}$ and the typical mass ratio $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$. The GWB in this case would be dominated by relatively distant $\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ SMBHs at $z \approx 2 - 3$, at the peak of quasar activity. Similarly to other population models, our results remain in tension with the local SMBH mass density.</description>

      <title>A binary system in the S cluster close to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster. In contrast with theoretical predictions, no binary system near Sgr A* has been identified. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic binary system in the S cluster with the masses of the components of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.50 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.14 M$_{\odot}$, assuming an edge-on configuration. Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372 $\pm$ 3 days for the two components. The binary system is stable against the disruption by Sgr A* due to the semi-major axis of the secondary being 1.59 $\pm$ 0.01 AU, which is well below its tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU. The system, known as D9, shows similarities to the G objects. We estimate an age for D9 of 2.7$^{+1.9}_{-0.3}$ x 10$^6$ yr that is comparable to the timescale of the SMBH-induced von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycle period of about 10$^6$ yr, causing the system to merge in the near future. Consequently, the population of G objects may consist of pre-merger binaries and post-merger products. The detection of D9 implies that binary systems in the S cluster have the potential to reside in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* for approximately 10$^6$ years.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Properties and Femtoscopic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from Lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, and mass-radius relation of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.</description>

      <title>A mechanism that could stop the acceleration process within a collisionless shock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are complex nonlinear structures that are not yet fully understood. In particular, the interaction between these shocks and the particles they accelerate remains elusive. Based on an instability analysis that relates the shock width to the spectrum of the accelerated particle and the shock density ratio, we find that the acceleration process could come to an end when the fraction of accelerated upstream particles reaches about 30\%. Only unmagnetized shocks are considered.</description>

      <title>Generation of cosmic ray trajectories by a Diffusion Model trained on test particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-Poor Very Metal-Poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, $\alpha$-poor VMP ($\alpha$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for Mg and other $\alpha$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 $\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority ($82\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most ($76\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\%$ and $29\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that $\alpha$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of AT 2016blu's recurring supernova impostor outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectra of the supernova (SN) impostor AT 2016blu spanning over a decade. This transient exhibits quasiperiodic outbursts with a $\sim$113 d period, likely triggered by periastron encounters in an eccentric binary system where the primary star is a luminous blue variable (LBV). The overall spectrum remains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes in line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features indicate contamination from a nearby H II region in the host galaxy, NGC 4559. Broader H$\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no correlation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase. At some epochs, H$\alpha$ exhibits asymmetric profiles with a stronger redshifted wing, while broad and sometimes multicomponent P Cygni absorption features occasionally appear, but are again uncorrelated with brightness or phase. These P Cygni absorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\alpha$ emission line, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's wind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence in line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a variable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild eccentricity. Recent photometric data indicate that AT 2016blu experienced its 20th outburst around May/June 2023, as predicted based on its period. This type of quasiperiodic LBV remains poorly understood, but its spectra and erratic light curve resemble some pre-SN outbursts like those of SN 2009ip.</description>

      <title>Effect of Type II Strong Gravitational Lensing on Tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BBH) coalescences provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential to identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising from missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This paper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong gravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard framework for GR tests. In the geometric optics approximation, strong lensing produces three types of images: Type I, Type II, and Type III. While Type I and Type III images do not distort the signal, Type II images introduce a characteristic phase shift that can mimic GR deviations for signals with higher-order modes, precession, or eccentricity. We assess the response of four standard GR tests on simulated Type II lensed BBH signals, including the two parameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. We focus on precessing waveforms for binaries with total masses of $20M_{\odot}$ and $80M_{\odot}$, and dimensionless spins of 0.5 and 0.95, considering a fixed signal-to-noise ratio of 25 using the design A+ sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Our findings indicate that more mass-asymmetric and higher-spin binaries show larger false deviations from GR in the TIGER and modified dispersion relation tests when applying GR tests to Type II lensed signals. These results highlight the risk of false GR violations as detector sensitivity improves in future observational runs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of strong lensing before drawing conclusions about deviations from GR in GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Thorne-\.Zytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-ray Binary LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high-mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO) might ultimately be assembled. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high-mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of T\.ZO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates ($\approx 10^{-2}M_\odot/{\rm s}$), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for T\.ZO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.</description>

      <title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. Particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out 2D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter $\sigma_0=20$, we find that the injection energy ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$ converges with increasing domain size to ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}\simeq 10m_ec^2$. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel ($W_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($W_\perp$) electric fields during both the injection phase and the post-injection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the $W_\perp$ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, both components contribute equally during the post-injection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy (${\varepsilon}\gg{\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$) particles, $W_\perp$ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.</description>

Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review and possibly revise their observing campaigns. The detection of a ''single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. We demonstrate that trading observations of the worst pulsars for high cadence campaigns on the best pulsars increases sensitivity to single sources at high frequencies while hedging losses in GWB and single source sensitivity at low frequencies. We also find that sky-targeted observing campaigns yield minimal sensitivity improvements compared with other PTA tuning options. Lastly, we show the importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, as an increasingly prominent sources of noise and show the impact of this emerging noise source on various PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Power of simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for probing AGN outflows</title>

Abstract: Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Merger Rates in AGN: contribution from gas-captured binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that merging black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs formed through two-body scatterings via the gas-capture process may explain a significant fraction of BH mergers in AGN and a non-negligible contribution to the observed rate from LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and mergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically motivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical simulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc physics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger rates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer boundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when migration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe is dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7} M_\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\odot$ - 10$^{8} M_\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH mass power law by a factor $\Delta \xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align with the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the merging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could easily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521 and GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler dynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the primary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most influential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their mass function. We conclude that AGN remain an important channel for consideration, particularly for gravitational wave detections involving one or two high mass BHs.</description>

      <title>Axion sourcing in dense stellar matter via CP-violating couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can source axion-like particles and QCD axions due to CP-violating axion-fermion couplings. The magnitude of the axion field depends on the stellar density and on the strength of the axion-fermion couplings. We show that even CP-violating couplings one order of magnitude smaller than existing constraints source extended axion field configurations. For axion-like particles, the axion energy is comparable to the magnetic energy in neutron stars with inferred magnetic fields of the order of $10^{13}$ G, and exceeds by more than one order of magnitude the magnetic energy content of white dwarfs with inferred fields of the order of $10^{4}$ G. On the other hand, the energy stored in the QCD axion field is orders of magnitude lower due to the smallness of the predicted CP-violating couplings. It is shown that the sourced axion field can polarize the photons emitted from the stellar surface, and stimulate the production of photons with energies in the radio band.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing mirror symmetry in the Universe with LIGO-Virgo black-hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain precessing black-hole mergers produce gravitational waves with net circular polarization, understood as an imbalance between right- and left-handed amplitudes. According to the Cosmological Principle, such emission must average to zero across all binary mergers in our Universe to preserve mirror-reflection symmetry at very large scales. We present a new independent gravitational-wave test of this hypothesis. Using a novel observable based on the Chern-Pontryagin pseudo-scalar, we measure the emission of net circular polarization across 47 black-hole mergers recently analyzed by Islam et. al. with a state-of-the art model for precessing black-hole mergers in General Relativity. The average value obtained is consistent with zero. Remarkably, however, we find that at least $82\%$ of the analysed sources must have produced net circular polarization. Of these, GW200129 shows strong evidence for mirror asymmetry, with a Bayes Factor of 12.6 or, equivalently, $93.1\%$ probability. We obtain consistent (although stronger) results of $97.5\%$ and $94.3\%$ respectively using public results on this event from Hannam et. al. and performing our own parameter inference. This finding further implies evidence of astrophysical sources that can spontaneously emit circularly polarized photons by quantum effects. Forthcoming black-hole merger detections will enable stronger constraints on large-scale mirror asymmetry and the Cosmological Principle.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4\,$s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ''partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Four years of wide-field search for nanosecond optical transients with the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been previously demonstrated [Panov et al. Physics of Atomic Nuclei 84(2021)1037] that the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array, originally built for cosmic ray physics and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray astronomy studies using the extensive air shower method, can be used in conventional optical astronomy for wide-field searches for rare nanosecond optical transients of astrophysical origin. The FOV of the facility is on the scale of 1~ster, and it is capable of detecting very rare transients in the visible light range with fluxes greater than approximately 3000~quanta/m$^2$/10~ns (10~ns is the apparatus integration time) and pulse durations of 10\,ns. Among the potential sources of distant nanosecond optical transients are the evaporation of primary black holes, magnetic reconnection in the accretion disks of black holes, and signals from distant lasers of extraterrestrial civilizations. The paper describes the methods and results of the search for optical transients using the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array from 2018 to 2022 (four winter seasons of data collection). No reliable astrophysical candidates for optical transients were found. We set an upper bound on the flux of the searched events as $\sim 1\times10^{-3}$\,events/ster/h.</description>
