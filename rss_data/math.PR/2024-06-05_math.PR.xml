      <title>On the Euler-Poincar\'e Characteristic of the planar Berry's random wave: fluctuations and a perturbation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Central Limit Theorem for the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of Berry's random wave model in a growing domain. We also show Gaussian fluctuations for a class of Berry's mixture models that correspond to a perturbation of the initial random field. Finally, some statistical applications, explicit calculations of the variance of the perturbed Berry's model and numerical investigations are provided to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The density conjecture for activated random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late 1990s, Dickman, Mu\~noz, Vespignani, and Zapperi explained the self-organized criticality observed by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld as an external force pushing a hidden parameter toward the critical value of a traditional absorbing-state phase transition. As evidence, they observed empirically that for various sandpile models the particle density in a finite box under driven-dissipative dynamics converges to the critical density of an infinite-volume version of the model. We give the first proof of this well-known density conjecture in any setting by establishing it for activated random walk in one dimension. We prove that two other natural versions of the model have the same critical value, further establishing activated random walk as a universal model of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation for two-dimensional Kawasaki dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \theta &lt; 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \Theta &lt; \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Cauchy Functional Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we introduce probabilistic Cauchy functional equations, specifically, functional equations of the following form: $$
  f(X_1 + X_2) \stackrel{d}{=} f(X_1) + f(X_2),
  $$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ represent two independent identically distributed real-valued random variables governed by a distribution $\mu$ having appropriate support on the real line. The symbol $\stackrel{d}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. When $\mu$ follows an exponential distribution, we provide sufficient (regularity) conditions on the function $f$ to ensure that the unique measurable solution to the above equation is solely linear. Furthermore, we present some partial results in the general case, establishing a connection to integrated Cauchy functional equations.</description>

      <title>One-arm Probabilities for Metric Graph Gaussian Free Fields below and at the Critical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the critical level-set of the Gaussian free field on the metric graph of $\mathbb Z^d$, we consider the one-arm probability $\theta_d(N)$, i.e., the probability that the boundary of a box of side length $2N$ is connected to the center. We prove that $\theta_d(N)$ is $O(N^{-\frac{d}{2}+1})$ for $3\le d\le 5$, and is $N^{-2+o(1)}$ for $d=6$. Our upper bounds match the lower bounds in a previous work by Ding and Wirth up to a constant factor for $3\le d\le 5$, and match the exponent therein for $d=6$. Combined with our previous result that $\theta_d(N) \asymp N^{-2}$ for $d&gt;6$, this seems to present the first percolation model whose one-arm probabilities are essentially completely understood in all dimensions. In particular, these results fully confirm Werner's conjectures (2021) on the one-arm exponents:
  \begin{equation*}
  \text{(1) for}\ 3\le d&lt;d_c=6,\ \theta_d(N)=N^{-\frac{d}{2}+o(1)};\ \text{(2) for}\ d&gt;d_c,\ \theta_d(N)=N^{-2+o(1)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Prior to our work, Drewitz, Pr\'evost and Rodriguez obtained upper bounds for $d\in \{3, 4\}$, which are very sharp although lose some diverging factors. In the same work, they conjectured that $\theta_{d_c}(N) = N^{-2+o(1)}$, which is now established. In addition, in a recent concurrent work, Drewitz, Pr\'evost and Rodriguez independently obtained the up-to-constant upper bound for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>How often does a critical elephant random walk return to origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the number of times the elephant random walk in the critical regime visits the origin. Our result entails that most zeros of the critical elephant random walk occur shortly before its last passage time at zero. Additionally, we derive the tail estimate of the first return time of the random walk.</description>

      <title>An efficient Wasserstein-distance approach for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes using parameterized neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Wasserstein distance ($W$-distance) between two probability distributions associated with two multidimensional jump-diffusion processes. Specifically, we analyze a temporally decoupled squared $W_2$-distance, which provides both upper and lower bounds associated with the discrepancies in the drift, diffusion, and jump amplitude functions between the two jump-diffusion processes. Then, we propose a temporally decoupled squared $W_2$-distance method for efficiently reconstructing unknown jump-diffusion processes from data using parameterized neural networks. We further show its performance can be enhanced by utilizing prior information on the drift function of the jump-diffusion process. The effectiveness of our proposed reconstruction method is demonstrated across several examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Long-term behavior of stochastic SIQRS epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze and classify the dynamics of SIQRS epidemiological models with susceptible, infected, quarantined, and recovered classes, where the recovered individuals can become reinfected. We are able to treat general incidence functional responses. Our models are more realistic than what has been studied in the literature since they include two important types of random fluctuations. The first type is due to small fluctuations of the various model parameters and leads to white noise terms. The second type of noise is due to significant environment regime shifts in the that can happen at random. The environment switches randomly between a finite number of environmental states, each with a possibly different disease dynamic. We prove that the long-term fate of the disease is fully determined by a real-valued threshold $\lambda$. When $\lambda &lt; 0$ the disease goes extinct asymptotically at an exponential rate. On the other hand, if $\lambda &gt; 0$ the disease will persist indefinitely. We end our analysis by looking at some important examples where $\lambda$ can be computed explicitly, and by showcasing some simulation results that shed light on real-world situations.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of a P\'olya functional for triangles and rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the functional given by the product of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the torsional rigidity of planar domains normalized by the area. This scale invariant functional was studied by P\'olya and Szeg\H{o} in 1951 who showed that it is bounded above by 1 for all domains. It has been conjectured that within the class of bounded convex planar domains the functional is bounded below by $\pi^{2}/24$ and above by $\pi^{2}/12$ and that these bounds are sharp. Remarkably, the conjecture remains open even within the class of triangles. The purpose of this paper is to prove the conjecture in this case. The conjecture is also proved for rectangles where a stronger monotonicity property is verified. Finally, the upper bound also holds for tangential quadrilateral.</description>

      <title>The bunkbed conjecture is not robust to generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bunkbed conjecture, which has featured in the folklore of probability theory since at least 1985, concerns bond percolation on the product graph $G\Box K_2$. We have two copies $G_0$ and $G_1$ of $G$, and if $x^{(0)}$ and $x^{(1)}$ are the copies of a vertex $x\in V(G)$ in $G_0$ and $G_1$ respectively, then edge $x^{(0)}x^{(1)}$ is present. The conjecture states that, for vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, percolation from $u^{(0)}$ to $v^{(0)}$ is at least as likely as percolation from $u^{(0)}$ to $v^{(1)}$. While the conjecture is widely expected to be true, having attracted significant attention, a general proof has not been forthcoming.
  In this paper we consider three natural generalisations of the bunkbed conjecture; to site percolation, to hypergraphs, and to directed graphs. Our main aim is to show that all these generalisations are false, and to this end we construct a sequence of counterexamples to these statements. However, we also consider under what extra conditions these generalisations might hold, and give some classes of graph for which the bunkbed conjecture for site percolation does hold.</description>

      <title>Conditional uncorrelation equals independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated in the sense $E[XY]=E[X]\cdot E[Y]$ and that the implication may be reversed in very specific cases only. This paper proves that under general assumptions the conditional uncorrelation of random variables, where the conditioning takes place over the suitable class of test sets, is equivalent to the independence. It is also shown that the mutual independence of $X_1,\dots,X_n$ is equivalent to the fact that any conditional correlation matrix equals to the identity matrix.</description>

      <title>Convergence Properties of the Asynchronous Maximum Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected directed graph on $n$ vertices. Assign values from the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to the vertices of $G$ and update the values according to the following rule: uniformly at random choose a vertex and update its value to the maximum of the values in its neighbourhood. The value at this vertex can potentially decrease. This random process is called the asynchronous maximum model. Repeating this process we show that for a strongly connected directed graph eventually all vertices have the same value and the model is said to have \textit{converged}. In the undirected case the expected convergence time is shown to be asymptotically (as $n\to \infty$) in $\Omega(n\log n)$ and $O(n^2)$ and these bounds are tight. We further characterise the convergence time in $O(\frac{n}{\phi}\log n)$ where $\phi$ is the vertex expansion of $G$. This provides a better upper bound for a large class of graphs. Further, we show the number of rounds until convergence is in $O((\frac{n}{\phi}\log n)g(n))$ with high probability, where $g(n)$ satisfies $\frac{1}{g^2(n)} \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. For a strongly connected directed graph the convergence time is shown to be in $O(nb^2 + \frac{n}{\phi'}\log n)$ where $b$ is a parameter measuring directed cycle length and $\phi'$ is a parameter measuring vertex expansion.</description>

      <title>Singular Subspace Perturbation Bounds via Rectangular Random Matrix Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ with singular values $\sigma_1\geq \cdots \geq \sigma_d$, and a random matrix $G \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ with iid $N(0,T)$ entries for some $T&gt;0$, we derive new bounds on the Frobenius distance between subspaces spanned by the top-$k$ (right) singular vectors of $A$ and $A+G$. This problem arises in numerous applications in statistics where a data matrix may be corrupted by Gaussian noise, and in the analysis of the Gaussian mechanism in differential privacy, where Gaussian noise is added to data to preserve private information. We show that, for matrices $A$ where the gaps in the top-$k$ singular values are roughly $\Omega(\sigma_k-\sigma_{k+1})$ the expected Frobenius distance between the subspaces is $\tilde{O}(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sigma_k-\sigma_{k+1}} \times \sqrt{T})$, improving on previous bounds by a factor of $\frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{d}} \sqrt{k}$. To obtain our bounds we view the perturbation to the singular vectors as a diffusion process -- the Dyson-Bessel process -- and use tools from stochastic calculus to track the evolution of the subspace spanned by the top-$k$ singular vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main purpose is to use a new condition, $\alpha$-local nondeterminism, which is an alternative to the classical local nondeterminism usually utilized in the Gaussian framework, in order to investigate Besov regularity, in the time variable $t$ uniformly in the space variable $x$, for local times $L(x, t)$ of a class of continuous processes. We also extend the classical Adler's theorem [1, Theorem 8.7.1] to the Besov spaces case. These results are then exploited to study the Besov irregularity of the sample paths of the underlying processes. Based on similar known results in the case of the bifractional Brownian motion, we believe that our results are sharp. As applications, we get sharp Besov regularity results for some classical Gaussian processes and the solutions of systems of non-linear stochastic heat equations. The Besov regularity of their corresponding local times is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Coalescent point process of branching trees in varying environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an arbitrary large population at the present time, originated at an unspecified arbitrary large time in the past, where individuals in the same generation reproduce independently, forward in time, with the same offspring distribution but potentially changing among generations. In other words, the reproduction is driven by a Galton-Watson process in a varying environment. The genealogy of the current generation backwards in time is uniquely determined by the coalescent point process $(A_i, i\geq 1)$, where $A_i$ is the coalescent time between individuals $i$ and $i+1$. In general, this process is not Markov. In constant environment, Lambert and Popovic (2013) proposed a Markov process of point measures to reconstruct the coalescent point process. We present a counterexample where we show that their process does not have the Markov property. The main contribution of this work is to propose a vector valued Markov process $(B_i,i\geq 1)$, that reach the goal to reconstruct the genealogy, with finite information for every $i$. Additionally, when the offspring distributions are lineal fractional, we show that the variables $(A_i, i\geq 1)$ are independent and identically distributed.</description>

      <title>Arcade Processes for Informed Martingale Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arcade processes are a class of continuous stochastic processes that interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between zeros at fixed pre-specified times. Their additive randomization allows one to match any finite sequence of target random variables, indexed by the given fixed dates, on the whole probability space. The randomized arcade processes (RAPs) can thus be interpreted as a generalization of anticipative stochastic bridges. The filtrations generated by these processes are utilized to construct a class of martingales which interpolate between the given target random variables. These so-called filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) are almost-sure solutions to the martingale interpolation problem and reveal an underlying stochastic filtering structure. In the special case of conditionally-Markov randomized arcade processes, the dynamics of FAMs are informed by Bayesian updating. The same ideas are applied to filtered arcade reverse-martingales, which are constructed in a similar fashion, using reverse-filtrations of RAPs, instead. As a potential application of this theory, optimal transportation is explored: FAMs may be used to introduce noise in martingale optimal transport, in a similar fashion to how Schr\"odinger's problem introduces noise in optimal transport. This information-based approach to transport is concerned with selecting an optimal martingale coupling for the target random variables under the influence of the noise that is generated by an arcade process, and suggests application in finance or climate science, for instance.</description>

      <title>Droplet dynamics in a two-dimensional rarefied gas under Kawasaki dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki conservative dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset\mathbb Z^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta\in(U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the present paper we use the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, i.e., $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm e^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta&lt;\Theta&lt;2\Delta-U$. In the third paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm e^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta&lt;\Theta&lt;\Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation.
  Since Kawasaki dynamics is conservative, i.e., particles are preserved, we need to control non-local effects in the way droplets are formed and dissolved. This is done via a deductive approach: the tube of typical trajectories leading to nucleation is described via a series of events on which the evolution of the gas consists of droplets wandering around on multiple space-time scales.</description>

      <title>Asymptotes of macroscopic observables in Gibbs measures of general interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the Gibbs measure of an interacting particle system with a general interaction kernel at various temperature regimes. We are particularly interested in fine features of the convergence to the mean-field density as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main results are concentration bounds, and estimates on the Laplace transform of fluctuations. The main technique is a regularization procedure for general interaction kernels, based on an associated parabolic flow.</description>

      <title>Deformed Fr\'echet law for Wigner and sample covariance matrices with tail in crossover regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $A_n:=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(a_{ij})$ an $n\times n$ symmetric random matrix, with elements above the diagonal given by i.i.d. random variables having mean zero and unit variance. It is known that when $\lim_{x\to\infty}x^4\mathbb{P}(|a_{ij}|&gt;x)=0$, then fluctuation of the largest eigenvalue of $A_n$ follows a Tracy-Widom distribution. When the law of $a_{ij}$ is regularly varying with index $\alpha\in(0,4)$, then the largest eigenvalue has a Fr\'echet distribution. An intermediate regime is recently uncovered in \cite{diaconu2023more}: when $\lim_{x\to\infty}x^4\mathbb{P}(|a_{ij}|&gt;x)=c\in(0,\infty)$, then the law of the largest eigenvalue follows a deformed Fr\'echet distribution. In this work we vastly extend the scope where the latter distribution may arise. We show that the same deformed Fr\'echet distribution arises (1) for sparse Wigner matrices with an average of $n^{O(1)}$ nonzero entries on each row; (2) for periodically banded Wigner matrices with bandwidth $d_n=n^{O(1)}$; and more generally for weighted adjacency matrices of any $k_n$-regular graphs with $k_n=n^{O(1)}$. In all these cases, we further prove that the joint distribution of the finitely many largest eigenvalues of $A_n$ form a deformed Poisson process, and that eigenvectors of the outlying eigenvalues of $A_n$ are localized, implying a mobility edge phenomenon at the spectral edge $2$. The sparser case with average degree $n^{o(1)}$ is also explored. Our technique extends to sample covariance matrices, proving for the first time that its largest eigenvalue still follows a deformed Fr\'echet distribution, assuming the matrix entries satisfy $\lim_{x\to\infty}x^4\mathbb{P}(|a_{ij}|&gt;x)=c\in(0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>On particle systems and critical strengths of general singular interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite interacting particle systems with strong repulsing-attracting or general interactions, we prove global weak well-posedness almost up to the critical threshold of the strengths of attracting interactions (independent of the number of particles), and establish other regularity results, such as a heat kernel bound in the regions where strongly attracting particles are close to each other. Our main analytic instruments are a variant of De Giorgi's method in $L^p$ and an abstract desingularization theorem.</description>

      <title>Metastable hierarchy in abstract low-temperature lattice models: an application to Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macroscopic number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we study the hierarchical phenomenon of metastability in low-temperature lattice models in the most general setting. Given an abstract dynamical system governed by a Hamiltonian function, we prove that there exists a hierarchical decomposition of the collection of stable plateaux in the system into multiple $\mathfrak{m}$ levels, such that at each level there exist tunneling metastable transitions between the stable plateaux, which can be characterized by convergence to an explicit simple Markov chain as the inverse temperature $\beta$ tends to infinity. In the second part, as an application, we characterize the $3$-level metastable hierarchy in Kawasaki dynamics for Ising lattice gas with macroscopic number of particles. We prove that the ground states in this model are those in which the particles line up and form a one-dimensional strip, and identify the full structure relevant to the tunneling transitions between these ground states. In particular, the results differ from the previous work [5] in that the particles in the ground states are likely to form a strip rather than a square droplet. The main tool is the resolvent approach to metastability, recently developed in [24]. Along with the analysis, we present a theorem on the sharp asymptotics of the exit distribution from cycles, which to the author's knowledge is not known in the community and therefore may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Group actions on orbits of an amenable equivalence relation and topological versions of Kesten's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish results connecting the uniform Liouville property of group actions on the classes of a countable Borel equivalence relation with amenability of this equivalence relation. We also study extensions of Kesten's theorem to certain classes of topological groups and prove a version of this theorem for amenable SIN groups. Furthermore, we discuss relationship between generalizations of Kesten's theorem and anticoncentration inequalities for the inverted orbits of random walks on the classes of an amenable equivalence relation. This allows us to construct an amenable Polish group that does not satisfy the limit conditions in combinatorial extensions of Kesten's theorem.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Separating Random Order from Order Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. A gambler is sent values in an online fashion, sampled from an instance of independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order, depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then observes the values, is known as Order Selection. In this model a ratio of $0.7251$ has been proved to be attainable for any instance. In very recent work, this has been improved up to $0.7258$. If the gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been extensively studied for at least $40$ years. In the recent work aforementioned, through simulations, this ratio has been shown to be at most $0.7254$ for the Random Order model, thus establishing for the first time that carefully choosing the order, instead of simply taking it at random, benefits the gambler. We give an alternative, non-simulation-assisted proof of this fact, by showing mathematically that in the Random Order model, no algorithm can achieve a ratio larger than $0.7235$. This sets a new state-of-the-art hardness for this model, and establishes more formally that there is a real benefit in choosing the order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple and self-contained construction of of the $P(\Phi)$ Euclidean Quantum Field Theory in the plane and verify the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms: translational and rotational invariance, reflection positivity and regularity. In the intermediate steps of the construction we study measures on spheres. In order to control the infinite volume limit we use the parabolic stochastic quantization equation and the energy method. To prove the translational and rotational invariance of the limit measure we take advantage of the fact that the symmetry groups of the plane and the sphere have the same dimension.</description>

      <title>An excursion onto Schr\"odinger's bridges: Stochastic flows with spatio-temporal marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Sliding down the stairs: how correlated latent variables accelerate learning with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>
