      <title>Bi-directional models of `radically synthetic' differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radically synthetic foundation for smooth geometry formulated in [Law11] postulates a space T with the property that it has a unique point and, out of the monoid T^T of endomorphisms, it extracts a submonoid R which, in many cases, is the (commutative) multiplication of a rig structure. The rig R is said to be bi-directional if its subobject of invertible elements has two connected components. In this case, R may be equipped with a pre-order compatible with the rig structure. We adjust the construction of `well-adapted' models of Synthetic Differential Geometry in order to build the first pre-cohesive toposes with a bi-directional R. We also show that, in one of these pre-cohesive variants, the pre-order on R, derived radically synthetically from bi-directionality, coincides with that defined in the original model.</description>

      <title>Element-Free Probability Distributions and Random Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An "element-free" probability distribution is what remains of a probability distribution after we forget the elements to which the probabilities were assigned. These objects naturally arise in Bayesian statistics, in situations where elements are used as labels and their specific identity is not important.
  This paper develops the structural theory of element-free distributions, using multisets and category theory. We give operations for moving between element-free and ordinary distributions, and we show that these operations commute with multinomial sampling. We then exploit this theory to prove two representation theorems. These theorems show that element-free distributions provide a natural representation for key random structures in Bayesian nonparametric clustering: exchangeable random partitions, and random distributions parametrized by a base measure.</description>

      <title>Natural numbers from integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In homotopy type theory, a natural number type is freely generated by an element and an endomorphism. Similarly, an integer type is freely generated by an element and an automorphism. Using only dependent sums, identity types, extensional dependent products, and a type of two elements with large elimination, we construct a natural number type from an integer type. As a corollary, homotopy type theory with only $\Sigma$, $\mathsf{Id}$, $\Pi$, and finite colimits with descent (and no universes) admits a natural number type. This improves and simplifies a result by Rose.</description>

      <title>Non-accessible localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a 2005 paper, Casacuberta, Scevenels and Smith construct a homotopy idempotent functor $E$ on the category of simplicial sets with the property that whether it can be expressed as localization with respect to a map $f$ is independent of the ZFC axioms. We show that this construction can be carried out in homotopy type theory. More precisely, we give a general method of associating to a suitable (possibly large) family of maps, a reflective subuniverse of any universe $\mathcal{U}$. When specialized to an appropriate family, this produces a localization which when interpreted in the $\infty$-topos of spaces agrees with the localization corresponding to $E$. Our approach generalizes the approach of [CSS] in two ways. First, by working in homotopy type theory, our construction can be interpreted in any $\infty$-topos. Second, while the local objects produced by [CSS] are always 1-types, our construction can produce $n$-types, for any $n$. This is new, even in the $\infty$-topos of spaces. In addition, by making use of universes, our proof is very direct.
  Along the way, we prove many results about "small" types that are of independent interest. As an application, we give a new proof that separated localizations exist. We also give results that say when a localization with respect to a family of maps can be presented as localization with respect to a single map, and show that the simplicial model satisfies a strong form of the axiom of choice which implies that sets cover and that the law of excluded middle holds.</description>
