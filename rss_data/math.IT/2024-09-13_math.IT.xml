      <title>Bounds on Covert Capacity in the Sub-Exponential Slotted Asynchronous Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop tight bounds for the covert capacity of slotted asynchronous binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, in which a codeword is transmitted in one of several slots with known boundaries, where the number of slots is sub-exponential in the codeword length. Our upper and lower bounds are within a multiplicative factor of $\sqrt{2}$ independent of the channel. This result partially fills a characterization gap between the covert capacity without asynchronism and the covert capacity with exponential asynchronism. Our key technical contributions consist of i) a tight upper bound for the relative entropy characterizing the effect of asynchronism on the covertness constraint in our achievability proof; ii) a careful converse analysis to characterize the maximum allowable weight or power of codewords to meet the covertness constraint. Our results suggest that, unlike the case without asynchronism, the choice of covertness metric does not change the covert capacity in the presence of asynchronism.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Weighted Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new federated learning scheme that leverages over-the-air computation. A novel feature of this scheme is the proposal to employ adaptive weights during aggregation, a facet treated as predefined in other over-the-air schemes. This can mitigate the impact of wireless channel conditions on learning performance, without needing channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT). We provide a mathematical methodology to derive the convergence bound for the proposed scheme in the context of computational heterogeneity and general loss functions, supplemented with design insights. Accordingly, we propose aggregation cost metrics and efficient algorithms to find optimized weights for the aggregation. Finally, through numerical experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Even with the challenges posed by channel conditions and device heterogeneity, the proposed scheme surpasses other over-the-air strategies by an accuracy improvement of 15% over the scheme using CSIT and 30% compared to the one without CSIT.</description>

      <title>Linear Complementary Dual Codes Constructed from Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Linear Complementary Dual (LCD) codes have garnered substantial interest within coding theory research due to their diverse applications and favorable attributes. This paper directs its attention to the construction of binary and ternary LCD codes leveraging curiosity-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By establishing reward and devising well-reasoned mappings from actions to states, it aims to facilitate the successful synthesis of binary or ternary LCD codes. Experimental results indicate that LCD codes constructed using RL exhibit slightly superior error-correction performance compared to those conventionally constructed LCD codes and those developed via standard RL methodologies. The paper introduces novel binary and ternary LCD codes with enhanced minimum distance bounds. Finally, it showcases how Random Network Distillation aids agents in exploring beyond local optima, enhancing the overall performance of the models without compromising convergence.</description>

      <title>Entropy Contractions in Markov Chains: Half-Step, Full-Step and Continuous-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the speed of convergence (mixing) of a finite Markov kernel $P$ with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence (entropy). Given a Markov kernel one defines either a discrete-time Markov chain (with the $n$-step transition kernel given by the matrix power $P^n$) or a continuous-time Markov process (with the time-$t$ transition kernel given by $e^{t(P-\mathrm{Id})}$). The contraction of entropy for $n=1$ or $t=0+$ are characterized by the famous functional inequalities, the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) and the modified log-Sobolev inequality (MLSI), respectively. When $P=KK^*$ is written as the product of a kernel and its adjoint, one could also consider the ``half-step'' contraction, which is the SDPI for $K$, while the ``full-step'' contraction refers to the SDPI for $P$. The work [DMLM03] claimed that these contraction coefficients (half-step, full-step, and continuous-time) are generally within a constant factor of each other. We disprove this and related conjectures by working out a number of different counterexamples. In particular, we construct (a) a continuous-time Markov process that contracts arbitrarily faster than its discrete-time counterpart; and (b) a kernel $P$ such that $P^{m+1}$ contracts arbitrarily better than $P^m$. Hence, our main conclusion is that the four standard inequalities comparing five common notions of entropy and variance contraction are generally not improvable.
  In the process of analyzing the counterexamples, we survey and sharpen the tools for bounding the contraction coefficients and characterize properties of extremizers of the respective functional inequalities. As our examples range from Bernoulli-Laplace model, random walks on graphs, to birth-death chains, the paper is also intended as a tutorial on computing MLSI, SDPI and other constants for these types of commonly occurring Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection Using Mismatched CUSUM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place and identify properties of the post-change behavior. The goal is to devise a stopping time adapted to the observations that minimizes an $L_1$ loss.
  Approximately optimal solutions are well known under a variety of assumptions. In the work surveyed here we consider the CUSUM statistic, which is defined as a one-dimensional reflected random walk driven by a functional of the observations. It is known that the optimal functional is a log likelihood ratio subject to special statical assumptions.
  The paper concerns model free approaches to detection design, considering the following questions:
  1. What is the performance for a given functional of the observations?
  2. How do the conclusions change when there is dependency between pre- and post-change behavior?
  3. How can techniques from statistics and machine learning be adapted to approximate the best functional in a given class?</description>

      <title>CROSS: A Contributor-Project Interaction Lifecycle Model for Open Source Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of open source software (OSS), its sustainability remains a critical concern, particularly in light of security vulnerabilities and the often inadequate end-of-service (EoS) processes for OSS projects as they decline. Existing models of OSS community participation, like the Onion model and the episodic contribution model, offer valuable insights but are fundamentally incompatible and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of contributor engagement with OSS projects. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing the CROSS model, a novel contributor-project interaction lifecycle model for open source, which delineates the various lifecycle stages of contributor-project interaction along with the driving and retaining forces pertinent to each stage. By synthesizing existing research on OSS communities, organizational behavior, and human resource development, it explains a range of archetypal cases of contributor engagement and highlights research gaps, especially in EoS/offboarding scenarios. The CROSS model provides a foundation for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of OSS projects, offering a robust foundation for future research and practical application.</description>

      <title>Universal Polarization for Processes with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.05727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transform that is universally polarizing over a set of channels with memory is presented. Memory may be present in both the input to the channel and the channel itself. Both the encoder and the decoder are aware of the input distribution, which is fixed. However, only the decoder is aware of the actual channel being used. The transform can be used to design a universal code for this scenario. The code is to have vanishing error probability when used over any channel in the set, and achieve the infimal information rate over the set. The setting considered is, in fact, more general: we consider a set of processes with memory. Universal polarization is established for the case where each process in the set: (a) has memory in the form of an underlying hidden Markov state sequence that is aperiodic and irreducible, and (b) satisfies a `forgetfulness' property. Forgetfulness, which we believe to be of independent interest, occurs when two hidden Markov states become approximately independent of each other given a sufficiently long sequence of observations between them. We show that aperiodicity and irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is not sufficient for forgetfulness, and develop a sufficient condition for a hidden Markov process to be forgetful.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis for Hybrid Sub-6GHz-mmWave-THz Networks with Downlink and Uplink Decoupled Cell Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is expected that 5G/6G networks will exploit sub-6 GHz, millimetre wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands simultaneously and will increase flexibility in user equipment (UE)-cell association. In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic geometry-based framework for the analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage in a multi-tier hybrid sub-6GHz-mmWave-THz network, where each tier has a particular base station (BS) density, transmit power, bandwidth, number of BS antennas, and cell-association bias factor. The proposed framework incorporates the effects of sub-6 GHz, mmWave and THz channel characteristics, BS beamforming gain, and blockages. We investigate the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled cell-association strategy and characterise the per-tier cell-association probability. Based on that, we analytically derive the SINR and rate coverage probabilities for both DL and UL transmissions. The analytical results are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy in terms of SINR and rate coverage over its coupled counterpart.</description>

      <title>Computation of the optimal error exponent function for fixed-length lossy source coding in discrete memoryless sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marton's optimal error exponent for the lossy source coding problem is defined as a non-convex optimization problem. This fact had prevented us to develop an efficient algorithm to compute it. This problem is caused by the fact that the rate-distortion function $R(\Delta|P)$ is potentially non-concave in the probability distribution $P$ for a fixed distortion level $\Delta$. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a parametric expression that is in perfect agreement with the inverse function of the Marton exponent. This representation has two layers. The inner layer is convex optimization and can be computed efficiently. The outer layer, on the other hand, is a non-convex optimization with respect to two parameters. We give a method for computing the Marton exponent based on this representation.</description>

      <title>Construction of CCC and ZCCS Through Additive Characters Over Galois Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progression in wireless communication technologies, especially in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA), there is a need of advanced code construction methods. Traditional approaches, mainly based on generalized Boolean functions, have limitations in code length versatility. This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing complete complementary codes (CCC) and Z-complementary code sets (ZCCS), for reducing interference in MC-CDMA systems. The proposed construction, distinct from Boolean function-based approaches, employs additive characters over Galois fields GF($p^{r}$), where $p$ is prime and $r$ is a positive integer. First, we develop CCCs with lengths of $p^{r}$, which are then extended to construct ZCCS with both unreported lengths and sizes of $np^{r}$, where $n$ are arbitrary positive integers. The versatility of this method is further highlighted as it includes the lengths of ZCCS reported in prior studies as special cases, underscoring the method's comprehensive nature and superiority.</description>

      <title>Towards Atomic MIMO Receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg atoms in quantum sensing is driving a paradigm shift from classical receivers to atomic receivers. Capitalizing on the extreme sensitivity of Rydberg atoms to external disturbance, atomic receivers can measure radio-waves more precisely than classical receivers to support high-performance wireless communication and sensing. Although the atomic receiver is developing rapidly in quantum-sensing domain, its integration with wireless communications is still at a nascent stage. Particularly, systematic methods to enhance communication performance through this integration are largely uncharted. Motivated by this observation, we propose to incorporate atomic receivers into multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication to implement atomic-MIMO receivers. Specifically, we establish the framework of atomic-MIMO receivers exploiting the principle of quantum sensing, and reveal that its signal detection is intrinsically a non-linear biased phase-retrieval (PR) problem, as opposed to the linear model in classical MIMO systems. To this end, we modify the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, a typical PR solver, with a biased GS algorithm to solve the discovered biased PR problem. Moreover, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-GS (EM-GS) algorithm by introducing a high-pass filter constructed by Bessel functions into the iteration of GS, which improves the detection accuracy efficiently. Finally, the effectiveness of atomic MIMO receivers is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>

Abstract: This letter studies the joint energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR)-based coverage probability in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The UAVs are spatially distributed in an aerial corridor that is modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) binomial point process (BPP). By accurately capturing the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of a UAV through large-scale fading i) an exact form expression for the energy coverage probability is derived, and ii) a tight approximation for the overall coverage performance is obtained. Among several key findings, numerical results reveal the optimal number of deployed UAV-BSs that maximizes the joint coverage probability, as well as the optimal length of the UAV corridors when designing such UAV-assisted IoT networks.</description>

Abstract: Implementing Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) in wireless systems is challenging due to noise, fading, and limited bandwidth, necessitating topology awareness, transmission scheduling, and the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) to mitigate interference and maintain reliable communications. These operations may result in substantial signaling overhead and scalability challenges in large networks lacking central coordination. This paper introduces a scalable DGD algorithm that eliminates the need for scheduling, topology information, or CSI (both average and instantaneous). At its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme that exploits a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. Nodes encode their local optimization signals into energy levels within an OFDM frame and transmit simultaneously, without coordination. The key insight is that the received energy equals, on average, the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals, scaled by their respective average channel gains, akin to a consensus step. This property enables unbiased consensus estimation, utilizing average channel gains as mixing weights, thereby removing the need for their explicit design or for CSI. Introducing a consensus stepsize mitigates consensus estimation errors due to energy fluctuations around their expected values. For strongly-convex problems, it is shown that the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes at a rate of O(1/sqrt{k}) after k iterations, with suitable decreasing learning and consensus stepsizes. Extensions accommodate a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical experiments on image classification demonstrate faster convergence in terms of running time compared to state-of-the-art schemes, especially in dense network scenarios.</description>
