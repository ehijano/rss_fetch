      <title>Symmetrisation effects on the correlation time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the electronic correlation contribution to the time delay in the photo-ionization of the excited ortho- and para-Helium states. A simple estimation, based on the ionization probability amplitudes, shows that the different form of anti-symmetrising both states can in principle lead to very different values of the correlation time delay. This result illuminates the interplay between electronic correlations and symmetrisation effects in the attosecond regime, a relation that has been studied in other contexts. Moreover, it suggests the potential of excited states to explore the role of exchange effects in that realm.</description>

      <title>Hyperradiance, photon blockade and concurrence in a pair of qubits inside a driven cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the radiance properties of a pair of qubits inside a single-mode cavity driven by a two-photon drive. Our results show that, when the two qubits are strongly coupled to the cavity field, the collective radiation emitted from the qubits exhibits hyperradiance which can be detected as a signature of two qubit entanglement in the weak-driving regime. We quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the radiance behaviour in the presence of an intracavity Kerr-nonlinear medium that leads to two-photon blockade. Our results suggest that this system with nonlinearity may act as a quadrature-squezzed and hyperradiant two-photon source.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</description>

      <title>Super narrow peaks in excitation spectrum of alkali spin polarization: non-adiabatic case of spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically describe the phenomenon of non-adiabatic spin dynamics, which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.</description>
