      <title>Re-entrant phase transitions induced by localization of zero-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common wisdom dictates that physical systems become less ordered when heated to higher temperature. However, several systems display the opposite phenomenon and move to a more ordered state upon heating, e.g. at low temperature piezoelectric quartz is paraelectric and it only becomes piezoelectric when heated to sufficiently high temperature. The presence, or better, the re-entrance of unordered phases at low temperature is more prevalent than one might think. Although specific models have been developed to understand the phenomenon in specific systems, a universal explanation is lacking. Here we propose a universal simple microscopic theory which predicts the existence of two critical temperatures in inhomogeneous systems, where the lower one marks the re-entrance into the less ordered phase. We show that the re-entrant phase transition is caused by disorder-induced spatial localization of the zero-mode on a finite, i.e. sub-extensive, region of the system. Specifically, this trapping of the zero-mode disconnects the fluctuations of the order parameter in distant regions of the system, thus triggering the loss of long-range order and the re-entrance into the disordered phase. This makes the phenomenon quite universal and robust to the underlying details of the model, and explains its ubiquitous observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic understanding of the dramatic increase in viscosity of liquids when cooled towards the glass transition is a major unresolved issue in condensed matter physics. Here, we use machine learning methods to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy for the glass-former toluene. We show that the increase in viscosity is intimately linked to the increasing number of dynamically correlated molecules $N^*$. While certain hallmark features of glassy dynamics, like physical aging, are linked to $N^*$ as well, others, like relaxation stretching, are not.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Feature Engineering to Predict the Dynamical Properties of Condensed Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph theory-based method to characterise flow defects and structural shifts in condensed matter. We explore the connection between dynamical properties, particularly the recently introduced concept of ''softness'', and graph-based features such as centrality and clustering coefficients. These topological features outperform conventional features based on Euclidean metric in predicting particle mobility and allow to correctly identify phase transitions as well. These results provide a new set of computational tools to investigate the dynamical properties of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks are artificial neural networks that mimic synapses and neurons using physical systems or materials. These networks harness the distinctive characteristics of physical systems to carry out computations effectively, potentially surpassing the constraints of conventional digital neural networks. A recent advancement known as ``physical self-learning'' aims to achieve learning through intrinsic physical processes rather than relying on external computations. This article offers a comprehensive review of the progress made in implementing physical self-learning across various physical systems. Prevailing learning strategies are discussed that contribute to the realization of physical self-learning. Despite challenges in understanding fundamental mechanism of learning, this work highlights the progress towards constructing intelligent hardware from the ground up, incorporating embedded self-organizing and self-adaptive dynamics in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases, which can be explained by analyzing the structure of the total wave function of the walker. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for characterizing uncertain elastic properties of fused filament fabricated materials for topology optimization applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layering approach used in fused filament fabrication (FFF) enables creation of complex designs generated by topology optimization. Defects associated with the layer-by-layer process, introduce considerable random variability to the local elastic modulus of the print. The elastic modulus along the fusion layers connecting bulk materials differs from that of the bulk areas. Accurate quantitative measurements of variations in both areas are essential to achieve robust optimized designs. This study aims to quantify the parameters of the random distributions given the surface strain field of the print measured by digital image correlation (DIC). Two statistical properties, mean and standard deviation, are sufficient to characterize the stochastic elastic modulus fields in each region. An efficient neural network model is developed to estimate spatial variations in the local elastic modulus within both bulk and fusion layers. This model is trained on a dataset of synthetic strain fields with known distributions in the elastic modulus fields. It performs well in correlating the elastic modulus with the input strain, as long as the standard deviation is below 60% of the mean of the random field. The predictive accuracy of the model on testing data, measured by the R2 score, is 0.99 and 0.95 for mean and standard deviation in the fusion material. The scores for the bulk material are 0.97 each. The trained model is implemented to predict the elastic modulus distribution of an FFF-printed material at a print speed of 30 mm/s and an extrusion temperature of 493.15 K, based on its DIC-measured surface strain data. The model predicts a mean and standard deviation of 1.2 GPa and 1 GPa for the bulk material and 400 MPa and 430 MPa for the fusion region. Validation of predictions confirms the reliability of this approach in measuring uncertainty in the local properties of the prints.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Descriptors for Condensed Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational scientists have long been developing a diverse portfolio of methodologies to characterise condensed matter systems. Most of the descriptors resulting from these efforts are ultimately based on the spatial configurations of particles, atoms, or molecules within these systems. Noteworthy examples include symmetry functions and the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptors, which have significantly advanced the performance of predictive machine learning models for both condensed matter and small molecules. However, while graph-based descriptors are frequently employed in machine learning models to predict the functional properties of small molecules, their application in the context of condensed matter has been limited. In this paper, we put forward a number of graph-based descriptors (such as node centrality and clustering coefficients) traditionally utilised in network science, as alternative representations for condensed matter systems. We apply this graph-based formalism to investigate the dynamical properties and phase transitions of the prototypical Lennard-Jones system. We find that our graph-based formalism outperforms symmetry function descriptors in predicting the dynamical properties and phase transitions of this system. These results demonstrate the broad applicability of graph-based features in representing condensed matter systems, paving the way for exciting advancements in the field of condensed matter through the integration of network science concepts.</description>

      <title>Dense Hopfield Networks in the Teacher-Student Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phases, localization and multifractality of monitored free fermions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure and wave function characteristics of continuously monitored free fermions with U$(1)$-symmetry in two spatial dimensions (2D). By deriving the exact fermion replica-quantum master equation, we line out two approaches: (i) a nonlinear sigma model analogous to disordered free fermions, resulting in an SU$(R)$-symmetric field theory of symmetry class AIII in (2+1) space-time dimensions, or (ii) for bipartite lattices, third quantization leading to a non-Hermitian SU$(2R)$-symmetric Hubbard model. Using exact numerical simulations, we explore the phenomenology of the entanglement transition in 2D monitored fermions, examining entanglement entropy and wave function inverse participation ratio. At weak monitoring, we observe characteristic $L\log L$ entanglement growth and multifractal dimension $D_q=2$, resembling a metallic Fermi liquid. Under strong monitoring, wave functions localize and the entanglement saturates towards an area law. Between these regimes, we identify a high-symmetry point exhibiting both entanglement growth indicative of emergent conformal invariance and maximal multifractal behavior. While this multifractal behavior aligns with the nonlinear sigma model of the Anderson transition, the emergent conformal invariance is an unexpected feature not typically associated with Anderson localization. These discoveries add a new dimension to the study of 2D monitored fermions and underscore the need to further explore the connection between non-unitary quantum dynamics in $D$ dimensions and quantum statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>
