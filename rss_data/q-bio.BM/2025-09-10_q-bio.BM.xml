      <title>Unveiling Biological Models Through Turing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turing patterns play a fundamental role in morphogenesis and population dynamics, encoding key information about the underlying biological mechanisms. Yet, traditional inverse problems have largely relied on non-biological data such as boundary measurements, neglecting the rich information embedded in the patterns themselves. Here we introduce a new research direction that directly leverages physical observables from nature--the amplitude of Turing patterns--to achieve complete parameter identification. We present a framework that uses the spatial amplitude profile of a single pattern to simultaneously recover all system parameters, including wavelength, diffusion constants, and the full nonlinear forms of chemotactic and kinetic coefficient functions. Demonstrated on models of chemotactic bacteria, this amplitude-based approach establishes a biologically grounded, mathematically rigorous paradigm for reverse-engineering pattern formation mechanisms across diverse biological systems.</description>

      <title>LSMTCR: A Scalable Multi-Architecture Model for Epitope-Specific T Cell Receptor de novo Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07627v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing full-length, epitope-specific TCR $\alpha\beta$ remains challenging due to vast sequence space, data biases and incomplete modeling of immunogenetic constraints. We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3$\beta$ and transferred to CDR3$\alpha$, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete $\alpha\beta$ sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For $\alpha$-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired $\alpha\beta$ co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>BioNeMo Framework: a modular, high-performance library for AI model development in drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10548v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models encoding biology and chemistry are opening new routes to high-throughput and high-quality in-silico drug development. However, their training increasingly relies on computational scale, with recent protein language models (pLM) training on hundreds of graphical processing units (GPUs). We introduce the BioNeMo Framework to facilitate the training of computational biology and chemistry AI models across hundreds of GPUs. Its modular design allows the integration of individual components, such as data loaders, into existing workflows and is open to community contributions. We detail technical features of the BioNeMo Framework through use cases such as pLM pre-training and fine-tuning. On 256 NVIDIA A100s, BioNeMo Framework trains a three billion parameter BERT-based pLM on over one trillion tokens in 4.2 days. The BioNeMo Framework is open-source and free for everyone to use.</description>

      <title>CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CAME-AB}, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an \emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525</description>
