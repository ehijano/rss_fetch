      <title>HybridRAG: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Vector Retrieval Augmented Generation for Efficient Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&amp;A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&amp;A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&amp;As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain</description>

      <title>What are the real implications for $CO_2$ as generation from renewables increases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind and solar electricity generation account for 14% of total electricity generation in the United States and are expected to continue to grow in the next decades. In low carbon systems, generation from renewable energy sources displaces conventional fossil fuel power plants resulting in lower system-level emissions and emissions intensity. However, we find that intermittent generation from renewables changes the way conventional thermal power plants operate, and that the displacement of generation is not 1 to 1 as expected. Our work provides a method that allows policy and decision makers to continue to track the effect of additional renewable capacity and the resulting thermal power plant operational responses.</description>

      <title>Ensemble data assimilation to diagnose AI-based weather prediction model: A case with ClimaX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with the advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</description>
