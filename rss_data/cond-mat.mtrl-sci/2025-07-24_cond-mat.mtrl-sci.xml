      <title>Sb2S3 and GaAs Absorber Layer-based Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Cadmium Telluride-based HTL: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) are widely acknowledged to be one of the best solar energy harvesting devices in the present world. Absorber layer is a core component of a QDSC with a strong influence on its operational efficiency. Hence, we choose to undertake a comparative study of two QDSC having different QD absorber layers: Sb2S3 and GaAs with the motive to identify the better absorber layer material. The numerical analysis has been carried out using SCAPS-1D (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator-1D). The structure of the QDSCs under study are: FTO/TiO2/CdS/Sb2S3/CuI/C and FTO/TiO2/CdS/GaAs/CuI/C. Critical parameters, including temperature, back contact work function, series and shunt resistances, were meticulously adjusted in the simulations, demonstrating that the maximum efficiency attained by Sb2S3 and GaAs absorber layer based QDSC is 15.94% and 26.95% respectively indicating GaAs-QD to be a better absorber layer material for a QDSC.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fe and Co binary catalysts in chemical vapor deposition growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal catalysts play a pivotal role in the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), with binary metallic catalysts emerging as an efficient SWCNT synthesis strategy. Among these, iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and their alloys are particularly effective. However, prior studies have predominantly employed Fe--Co alloy catalysts with fixed atomic ratios as well as unchanged chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions, leaving the influence of variable Fe--Co compositions and CVD growth parameters on SWCNT synthesis poorly understood. This study focuses on the role of Fe--Co catalyst ratios, with the aim of elucidating the distinct contributions of Fe and Co atoms in the growth of SWCNTs. By systematically exploring a wide range of Fe--Co ratios and growth conditions, we identified Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ as a highly efficient binary catalyst at 850~$^\circ$C, primarily forming catalyst clusters with diameters of 2.5--6~nm and yielding SWCNTs with diameters ranging from 0.9--1.1~nm. On the other hand, Fe$_{0}$Co$_{1}$ exhibited higher catalytic activity at 600~$^\circ$C, generating smaller catalyst clusters of 1.5--5~nm and producing SWCNTs with reduced diameters of about 0.6--0.9~nm. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of uniformly sized Fe--Co catalyst particles with surface-segregated Co that optimizes carbon solubility. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further corroborate these findings, demonstrating that the structure and melting behavior of Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$ clusters depend on cluster size and composition.</description>

      <title>Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved strain measurements are crucial to understanding the properties of engineering materials. Although strain measurements utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction offer high spatial resolution, they are limited to surface or thin samples. X-ray diffraction methods, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging and X-ray topography, enable strain measurements deep inside bulk materials but face challenges in simultaneously achieving both high spatial resolution and large field-of-view. Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) offers a promising solution with its ability to image bulk crystals at the nanoscale while offering a field-of-view approaching a few hundred $\mu$m. However, an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in DFXM to the strain and lattice rotation tensors is lacking. In this paper, we develop such an inverse modeling formalism. Using the oblique diffraction geometry, enabling access to noncoplanar symmetry-equivalent reflections, we demonstrate that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible. We also develop the computational framework to both forward calculate the anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Finally, utilizing the established formalism and computational framework, we present methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific angles of DFXM. The developed sensitivity analysis also enables explicit computation of the errors associated with the reconstruction of each component. The formalism, the computational framework, and the sensitivity analysis established in this paper should assist both the interpretation of past DFXM experiments and the design of future DFXM experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient $G_0W_0$ and BSE calculations of heterostructures within an all-electron framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of two-dimensional materials into heterostructures offers new opportunities for the design of optoelectronic devices with tunable properties. However, computing electronic and optical properties of such systems using state-of-the-art methodology is challenging due to their large unit cells. This is in particular so for highly-precise all-electron calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which come with high computational costs. Here, we extend an approach that allows for the efficient calculation of the non-interacting polarizability, previously developed for planewave basis sets, to the (linearized) augmented planewave (L)APW method. This approach is based on an additive ansatz, which computes and superposes the polarizabilities of the individual components in their respective unit cells. We implement this formalism in the $G_0W_0$ module of the exciting code and implement an analogous approach for BSE calculations. This allows the calculation of highly-precise optical spectra at low cost. So-obtained results of the quasi-particle band structure and optical spectra are demonstrated for bilayer WSe$_2$ and pyridine@MoS$_2$ in comparison with exact reference calculations.</description>

      <title>Tuning chiral anomaly signature in a Dirac semimetal via fast-ion implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cd$_3$As$_2$ is a prototypical Dirac semimetal that hosts a chiral anomaly and thereby functions as a platform to test high-energy physics hypotheses and to realize energy efficient applications. Here we use a combination of accelerator-based fast ion implantation and theory-driven planning to enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR)--a signature of a chiral anomaly--in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films. High-energy ion implantation is commonly used to investigate semiconductors and nuclear materials but is rarely employed to study quantum materials. We use electrical transport and transmission electron microscopy to characterize the NLMR and the crystallinity of Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films. We find surface-doped Nb-Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films display a maximum NLMR around $B = 7$ T and bulk-doped Nb-Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films display a maximum NLMR over $B = 9$ T--all while maintaining crystallinity. This is more than a 100% relative enhancement of the maximum NLMR compared to pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films ($B = 4$ T). Our work demonstrates the potential of high-energy ion implantation as a practical route to realize chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Compositional Tuning in NaxAlB14 via Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A uniform Na distribution in NaxAlB14 was achieved using high-pressure diffusion control (HPDC), which promotes Na deintercalation through enhanced diffusion under high pressure, combined with post-annealing. NaxAlB14 with a non-stoichiometric Na composition is thermodynamically metastable, and conventional solid-state reactions with adjusted starting compositions typically result in the formation of stoichiometric NaAlB14 and side products. While HPDC alone typically leads to concentration gradients, intentionally halting the Na removal process before complete extraction, followed by annealing, enabled a uniform composition across the bulk. This allowed structural and electronic properties to be examined over a wide range of Na concentrations. As Na content decreased, electrical conductivity increased, and the optical band gap narrowed. NMR measurements showed an increase in the density of states at the Fermi level, consistent with DFT calculations predicting boron-related in-gap states. Boron vacancies at specific sites were found to generate deep levels near the band gap center, which can explain experimentally observed optical gap reduction. These results demonstrate that diffusion-controlling methods can be effectively applied to synthesize metastable compounds with tunable compositions in covalent frameworks. Furthermore, they provide a foundation for designing functional boride-based materials with adjustable electronic properties by controlling Na extraction and inducing defect formation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-clean interface between high k dielectric and 2D MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for next-generation transistor channels due to their superior scaling properties. However, the integration of ultra-thin gate dielectrics remains a challenge, as conventional oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, and HfO2 tend to unintentionally dope 2D TMDs and introduce interfacial defect states, leading to undesirable field-effect transistor (FET) performance and unstable threshold voltages. Here, we demonstrate that zirconium oxide (ZrO2), a high-k dielectric compatible with semiconductor processing, forms an ultra-clean interface with monolayer MoS2. Using soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory, we find that ZrO2 does not measurably interact with MoS2, in contrast to significant doping observed for SiO2 and HfO2 substrates. As a result, back-gated monolayer MoS2 FETs fabricated with ZrO2 dielectrics exhibit stable and positive threshold voltages (0.36 plus/minus 0.3 V), low subthreshold swing (75 mV per decade), and high ON currents exceeding 400 microamperes. We further demonstrate p-type WSe2 FETs with ON currents greater than 200 microamperes per micrometer by suppressing electron doping with ZrO2 dielectrics. Atomic-resolution imaging confirms a defect-free ZrO2/MoS2 interface, which enables top-gate FETs with an equivalent oxide thickness of 0.86 nanometers and subthreshold swing of 80 mV per decade. Moreover, the ultraclean ZrO2/MoS2 interface allows for effective threshold voltage modulation in top-gate FETs via gate metal work function engineering. These findings establish ZrO2 as a highly promising, industry-compatible high-k dielectric for scalable 2D TMD-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Defect-Assisted Recombination in Semiconductors and Photovoltaic Device Parameters from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to calculate defect-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination rates in imperfect semiconductors from first principles. The method accounts for the steady state recombination dynamics under given non-equilibrium conditions (split quasi Fermi levels), by invoking a full solution to the rate equations describing transitions across the band gap via all possible charge states of the defect. Transition rates due to radiative and non-radiative multi-phonon emission processes are calculated from first principles. The method is used to evaluate the effect of selected defects on the photovoltaic device parameters of seven emergent photovoltaic semiconductors. These examples clearly highlight the limitations of commonly employed approximations to the recombination dynamics. Our work advances the description and understanding of defect-induced losses in photovoltaics and provides a basis for developing the important concept of defect tolerant semiconductors and to discover high-performance photovoltaic materials computationally.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane ferroelectricity, magnetoelectric coupling and persistent spin texture in two-dimensional multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional multiferroics with out of plane ferroelectricity hold significant promise for miniaturized magnetoelectric spin-orbit transistors, yet systems combining robust ferroelectricity and strong magnetoelectric coupling are exceedingly rare. Here, we demonstrate that epitaxial strain stabilizes out of plane ferroelectricity in exfoliated two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper derivatives. The hybrid improper ferroelectric Pc phase transitions to a competing P21 phase with purely in plane polarization upon switching, accompanied by a 90 degree rotation of weak ferromagnetism. Crucially, the Pc phase exhibits altermagnetism, while P21 displays full Brillouin zone band splitting, with persistent spin textures rotating 90 degree at the phase boundary. This work establishes a pathway to engineer two dimensional multiferroics that integrate vertical polarization, magnetoelectric coupling, and switchable spin textures, key features for next generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-vacancy centre formation via local femto-second laser annealing of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging quantum technologies based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond require carefully engineered material with controlled defect density, optimised NV formation processes, and minimal crystal strain. The choice of NV generation technique plays a crucial role in determining the quality and performance of these centres. In this work, we investigate NV centre formation in nitrogen-doped diamond using femtosecond (fs) laser processing. We systematically examine the effect of laser pulse energy on NV production and quality using photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. We also probe the role of pre-existing lattice defects formed by electron irradiation and consider defect evolution over extended dwell times. Finally, we are able to identify a regime where the main action of the fs-laser is to diffuse rather than create vacancies. This local annealing capability expands the toolkit for tailored NV production and presents opportunities for fine tuning defect populations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetoresistance in an antiferromagnetic Kagome semimetal heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Kagome semimetals have attracted tremendous attentions for their potential application in antiferromagnetic topological spintronics. Effectively manipulating Kagome antiferromagnetic states could reveal abundant physical phenomena induced from quantum interactions between topology, spin, and correlation. Here, we achieved tunable spin textures of FeSn thin films via introducing interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction from heavy-metal Pt overlayer. With increasing FeSn thickness, the variable spin textures result in gradual change in Hall resistivity and magnetoresistance. Importantly, an unconventional damped oscillatory-like behavior of magnetoresistance at relatively low magnetic field can be observed in thin FeSn-Pt samples. This oscillatory like magnetoresistance feature was confirmed to be related to the special topological spin textures revealed by magnetic force microscopy measurements. The formation of rich variety of topological spin textures in association with exotic magneto-transport properties in antiferromagnetic Kagome FeSn heterostructures offers new perspectives for understanding the novel emergent phenomena in Kagome antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the functional properties of diamond-like quaternary compound Li$_2$ZnGeS$_4$ for potential energy applications: A theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is anticipated that wide-bandgap semiconductors (WBGSs) would be useful materials for energy production and storage. A well-synthesized, yet, scarcely explored diamond-like quaternary semiconductor-Li$_2$ZnGeS$_4$ has been considered for this work. Herein, we have employed two well-known functionals GGA and mGGA within a frame-work of density functional theory (DFT). We have explored the electronic, optical, mechanical, and piezo-electromechanical properties. Our results are in qualitative agreement with some of the previously reported data. The structural stabilities have been confirmed using the Born stability criteria and Molecular-dynamic (MD) simulations. Based on our findings, we claim that Li$_2$ZnGeS$_4$ is the most probable candidate for optoelectronics and piezoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnetization Temperature Dependence in Ferrimagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnetics, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnetics such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnetics two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T &lt;&lt; T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dis-GEN: Disordered crystal structure generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of synthesized crystalline inorganic materials exhibit compositional disorder, where multiple atomic species partially occupy the same crystallographic site. As a result, the physical and chemical properties of such materials are dependent on how the atomic species are distributed among the corresponding symmetrical sites, making them exceptionally challenging to model using computational methods. For this reason, existing generative models cannot handle the complexities of disordered inorganic crystals. To address this gap, we introduce Dis-GEN, a generative model based on an empirical equivariant representation, derived from theoretical crystallography methodology. Dis-GEN is capable of generating symmetry-consistent structures that accommodate both compositional disorder and vacancies. The model is uniquely trained on experimental structures from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) - the world's largest database of identified inorganic crystal structures. We demonstrate that Dis-GEN can effectively generate disordered inorganic materials while preserving crystallographic symmetry throughout the generation process. This approach provides a critical check point for the systematic exploration and discovery of disordered functional materials, expanding the scope of generative modeling in materials science.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of magnetic textures in stripe domain bifurcations for reconfigurable domain wall racetracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the racetrack memory paradigm, systems exploiting magnetic guiding potentials instead of geometrical ones, allow for enhancing the versatility of the final devices adding magnetic reconfigurable capabilities. Hard/soft magnetic multilayers with stripe domain configurations fulfill these requirements. In these systems, the topology of the generated textures that would act as information carriers, is strongly conditioned by the stripe lattice configuration. Micromagnetic simulations have been used to study the magnetization reversal process in NdCo$_5$/Py reconfigurable racetracks. By using skyrmionic charges and magnetic vorticity lines, the topological transformations controlling the nucleation of vortices, antivortices, Bloch lines and Bloch points has been analyzed. It has been shown that magnetic topological charge exchanges between textures rule the formation of vortex/antivortex pairs with opposite polarities, key for the guided propagation through the stripe pattern.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Hall-Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-memristors are a class of materials that can store memories through the control of spins, potentially leading to novel technologies that address the constraints of standard silicon electronics, thereby facilitating the advancement of more intelligent and energy-efficient computing systems. In this work, we present a spin-memristor based on antiferromagnetic materials that exhibit Hall-memresistance. Moreover, the nonlinear Edelstein effect acts as both a writer and eraser of memory registers. We provide a generic symmetry-based analysis that supports the viability of the effect. To achieve a concrete realization of these ideas, we focus on CuMnAs, which has been shown to have a controllable nonlinear Hall effect. Our results extend the two-terminal spin-memristor setting, which is customarily the standard type of device in this context, to a four-terminal device.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50~meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>2D ferroelectricity accompanying antiferro-orbital order in semi-metallic WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first switchable electric polarization in metals was recently discovered in bilayer and trilayer WTe2. Strangely, despite the tininess of the ordered polarization, the ferroelectricity survives up to 350 K, rendering the mechanism of such ferroelectricity challenging for standard understandings. Here, via a density-functional-based multi-energy-scale analysis of the system's broken symmetries, we identify a weak out-of-plane ferroelectricity accompanying a strong in-plane antiferro-orbital order. This unusual low-energy correlation, which emerges from an antiferroelectric structure formed at much higher energy, naturally explains the above puzzling observation. This result reveals an unprecedented paradigm of electronic ferroelectricity generally applicable to 2D polar metals with ultrafast-switchable polarization ideal for the next-generation non-volatile memory and other devices.</description>

      <title>Active {\Delta}-learning with universal potentials for global structure optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have recently been formulated and shown to generalize well. When applied out-of-sample, further data collection for improvement of the uMLIPs may, however, be required. In this work we demonstrate that, whenever the envisaged use of the MLIPs is global optimization, the data acquisition can follow an active learning scheme in which a gradually updated uMLIP directs the finding of new structures, which are subsequently evaluated at the density functional theory (DFT) level. In the scheme, we augment foundation models using a {\Delta}-model based on this new data using local SOAP-descriptors, Gaussian kernels, and a sparse Gaussian Process Regression model. We compare the efficacy of the approach with different global optimization algorithms, Random Structure Search, Basin Hopping, a Bayesian approach with competitive candidates (GOFEE), and a replica exchange formulation (REX). We further compare several foundation models, CHGNet, MACE-MP0, and MACE-MPA. The test systems are silver-sulfur clusters and sulfur-induced surface reconstructions on Ag(111) and Ag(100). Judged by the fidelity of identifying global minima, active learning with GPR-based {\Delta}-models appears to be a robust approach. Judged by the total CPU time spent, the REX approach stands out as being the most efficient.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enabled large-scale analysis of particle geometry-lithiation correlations in battery cathode materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning model is employed to address the challenging problem of V2O5 nanoparticle segmentation and the correlation between the chemical composition and the geometrical features of lithiated V2O5 nanoparticles as an exemplar of a phase-transforming battery cathode material. First, the deep learning-enabled segmentation model is integrated with the singular value decomposition technique and a spectral database to generate accurate composition and phase maps capturing lithiation heterogeneities as imaged using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. These phase maps act as the output properties for correlation analysis. Subsequently, the quantitative influences of the geometrical features of nanoparticles such as the particle size (i.e., projected perimeter and area), the aspect ratio, circularity, convexity, and orientation on the lithiation phase maps are revealed. These findings inform strategies to improve lithiation uniformity and reduce stress in phase-transforming lithium battery materials via optimized particle geometry.</description>

      <title>Programmable phase selection between altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe on InP via molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase selecting nearly degenerate crystalline polymorphs during epitaxial growth can be challenging yet is critical to targeting physical properties for specific applications. Here, we establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe with high structural quality and phase purity can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates in molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth. Bulk altermagnetic MnTe is thermodynamically stable in the hexagonal NiAs-structure and is synthesized here on the (111)A surface (In-terminated) of InP, while the non-centrosymmetric, cubic ZnS-structure with wide band gap (&gt; 3eV) is stabilized on the (111)B surface (P-terminated). Here we use electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction, which together indicate that the phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. First principles calculations suggest that interfacial termination and strain have a significant effect on the interfacial energy; stabilizing the NiAs polymorph on the In-terminated surface and the ZnS structure on the P-terminated surface. Selectively grown, high-quality films of MnTe polymorphs are key platforms that will enable our understanding of the novel properties of these materials, thereby facilitating their use in new applications ranging from spintronics to microelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Indirect multiphoton scattering between light and bulk plasmons via ultrafast free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth, and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale. An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume, thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at ultrafast and nanometer scales.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of nanoparticles from carboxymethyl cellulose using one-pot hydrothermal carbonization for Drug Entrapment Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous nanomaterials have recently attracted a lot of attention due to various properties and potential applications. In this study, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source for carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization resulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1 micrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples resulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The positive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different functional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing aromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the other hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the lowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures. ACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials with a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The high surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high adsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using SEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation of clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with negative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order on ultrafast timescales, driven by spintronic and recording applications, is one of the main directions of current research in magnetism. Despite major advances in understanding the temporal evolution of magnetic order upon its emergence or quenching, experimental demonstration of the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation is missing. Here, taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, we observe that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks. We observe that the dislocation networks are formed and rearranged upon repeated crossing of the phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Our results establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase, with broad implications for ultrafast stroboscopic experiments and defect-mediated phase transitions in functional materials.</description>

      <title>Three-step growth of vapor-deposited ice under mesospheric temperature and water vapor conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly understood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze the structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K) under vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during vapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up to 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth suggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric clouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step growth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited ice at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Non-equilibrium Structures of Active Dipolar Particles by an External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effect of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We also demonstrate analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Simplified approach to estimate Lorenz number using experimental Seebeck coefficient for non parabolic band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is one of the most effective ways of improving thermoelectric properties. However extraction of $\kappa_L$ from the total measured thermal conductivity can be misleading if Lorenz ($L$) number is not estimated correctly. The $\kappa_L$ is obtained using Wiedemann-Franz law which estimates electronic part of thermal conductivity $\kappa_e$ = $L$$\sigma$T where, $\sigma$ and T are electrical conductivity and temperature. The $\kappa_L$ is then estimated as $\kappa_L$ = $\kappa_T$ - $L$$\sigma$T. For the metallic system the Lorenz number has universal value of 2.44 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ W$\Omega$K$^{-2}$ (degenerate limit), but for no-degenerate semiconductors, the value can deviate significantly for acoustic phonon scattering, the most common scattering mechanism for thermoelectric above room temperatures. Up till now, $L$ is estimated by solving a series of equation derived form Boltzmann transport equations. For the single parabolic band (SPB) an equation was proposed to estimate $L$ directly from the experimental Seebeck coefficient. However using SPB model will lead to overestimation of $L$ in case of low band gap semiconductors which result in underestimation of $\kappa_L$ sometimes even negative $\kappa_L$. In this letter we propose a simpler equation to estimate $L$ for a non parabolic band. Experimental Seebeck coefficient, band gap($E_g$), and Temperature ($T$) are the main inputs in the equation which nearly eliminates the need of solving multiple Fermi integrals besides giving accurate values of $L$.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover and emergence of novel phases in puckered PdSe$_2$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. At $\sim$ 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Crystal tensor properties of magnetic materials with and without spin-orbit coupling. Application of spin point groups as approximate symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin space groups, formed by operations where the rotation of the spins is independent of the accompanying operation acting on the crystal structure, are appropriate groups to describe the symmetry of magnetic structures with null spin-orbit coupling. Their corresponding spin point groups are the symmetry groups to be considered for deriving the symmetry constraints on the form of the crystal tensor properties of such idealized structures. These groups can also be taken as approximate symmetries (with some restrictions) of real magnetic structures, where spin-orbit and magnetic anisotropy are however present. Here we formalize the invariance transformation properties that must satisfy the most important crystal tensors under a spin point group. This is done using modified Jahn symbols, which generalize those applicable to ordinary magnetic point groups [Gallego et al., Acta Cryst. (2019) A75, 438-447]. The analysis includes not only equilibrium tensors, but also transport, optical and non-linear optical susceptibility tensors. The constraints imposed by spin collinearity and coplanarity within the spin group formalism on a series of representative tensors are discussed and compiled. As illustrative examples, the defined tensor invariance equations have been applied to some known magnetic structures, showing the differences of the symmetry-adapted form of some relevant tensors, when considered under the constraints of its spin point group or its magnetic point group. This comparison, with the spin point group implying additional constraints in the tensor form, can allow one to distinguish those magnetic-related properties that can be solely attributed to spin-orbit coupling from those that are expected even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent random phase approximation and optimized hybrid functionals for solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) and the $GW$ approximation share the same total energy functional but RPA is defined on a restricted domain of Green's functions determined by a local Kohn-Sham (KS) potential. In this work, we perform self-consistent RPA calculations by optimizing the local KS potential through the optimized effective potential equation. We study a number of solids (C, Si, BN, LiF, MgO, TiO$_2$), and find in all cases a lowering of the total energy with respect to non-self-consistent RPA. We then propose a variational approach to optimize parameter-dependent hybrid functionals based on the minimization of the RPA total energy with respect to the fraction of exact exchange used to generate the input KS orbitals. We show that this scheme leads to hybrid functionals with a KS band structure in close agreement with RPA, and with lattice constants of similar accuracy as within RPA. Finally, we evaluate $G_0W_0$ gaps using RPA and hybrid KS potentials as starting points. Special attention is given to TiO$_2$, which exhibits a strong starting-point dependence.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Electronic Band Alignment and Potentially Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties in Phase-Separated Mg2X (X=Si,Ge,Sn) Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mg2X (X=Si, Ge, Sn) based alloy is an eco-friendly thermoelectric material for mid-temperature applications. The Mg2Si1-xSnx and Mg2Ge1-xSnx alloys can be phase-separated into Si(Ge)- and Sn-rich phases during material synthesis, leading to a nanocomposite with locally varying electronic band structure. First-principles calculations reveal that the valence band offset is eight-times larger than the conduction band offset at the interface between Si- and Sn-rich phases for x=0.6, showing type-I and asymmetric band alignment (0.092 eV versus 0.013 eV). Using Boltzmann transport theory and thermionic emission calculations, we show that the large valence band energy discontinuity could allow for energy filtering effects to take place that can potentially increase the power factor substantially in the p-type material system if designed appropriately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simphony is an open-source software package designed for the topological analysis of lattice vibrations based on Wannier tight-binding models. Its primary function is to classify the topology of novel materials by computing bulk and slab phonon band structures, extracting phonon surface spectra, and providing analysis tools such as Wilson loop calculations and Weyl node detection. The workflow is analogous to that of established electronic topology codes like Wannier90 and WannierTools. It also incorporates long-range polar interactions during the wannierization process, making Simphony one of the first tools capable of diagnosing topology in polar insulators.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuned Language Models Generate Stable Inorganic Materials as Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose fine-tuning large language models for generation of stable materials. While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Chemical reasoning in LLMs unlocks strategy-aware synthesis planning and reaction mechanism elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While automated chemical tools excel at specific tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful tools enabling chemical analysis. When integrated with traditional search algorithms, they enable a new approach to computer-aided synthesis that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our system allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language -- from protecting group strategies to global feasibility assessment -- and uses traditional or LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to find routes that satisfy these constraints. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. This approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with newer and larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical automation systems.</description>

      <title>High Chern numbers and topological flat bands in high-field polarized Kitaev magnets on the star lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometrically frustrated Kitaev magnets are demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds that allow for the occurrence of exotic phenomena, including topological phases and the thermal Hall effect. Notwithstanding the established consensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet hosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \pm1$, the nature of magnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated geometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star lattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear spin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find that topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct topological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse order. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either $+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness are identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological high-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field increases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its sign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).</description>

Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are a major source of decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their atomistic origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, which are predominantly based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and only measure defects within a narrow frequency band and limited mode volume, hindering direct insight into TLS defect behaviour in isolated materials and interfaces. Here, we introduce a broadband 3D waveguide spectroscopy technique that enables cryogenic probing of ensembles of TLS defects that we call Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS). Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands of the ensembles of TLS defects. The broadband and power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it especially well-suited to the study of dressed-state physics in driven ensembles of TLS defects, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. Additionally, BCTDS enables the identification of eigenmode frequencies of the undriven ensembles of TLS defects through characteristic V-shaped features obtained via Fourier analysis of time-domain signals, and shows evidence of memory effects arising from interactions and the broadband nature of our approach. Crucially, our method is modular and can be applied throughout the device fabrication process, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>
