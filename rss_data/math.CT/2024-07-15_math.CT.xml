      <title>You Wouldn't Permutahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop formulas that define permutahedral commutation coherence relations of all orders. To illustrate the result geometrically, we begin by defining a rigid transformation of the $(n+1)$-permutahedron into a $n$-cube of dimensions $1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n$. With a fictitious assumption, we 'define' the corresponding coherence relations 'up to associativity' as an instance of a semi-simplicial type in the language of Displayed Type Theory. This is not a formal result in type theory, but we expect this to translate into one as soon as the problem of defining associahedral coherences is solved in a type theory with semi-simplicial types. On the other hand, this not-strictly-well-typed definition may be used to produce well-typed formulas in a restricted setting.</description>

      <title>A manifestly Morita-invariant construction of Turaev-Viro invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a state sum construction that assigns a scalar to a skeleton in a closed oriented three-dimensional manifold. The input datum is the pivotal bicategory $\mathbf{Mod}^{\mathrm{sph}}(\mathcal{A})$ of spherical module categories over a spherical fusion category $\mathcal{A}$.
  The interplay of algebraic structures in this pivotal bicategory with moves of skeleta ensures that our state sum is independent of the skeleton on the manifold. We show that the bicategorical invariant recovers the value of the standard Turaev-Viro invariant associated to $\mathcal{A}$, thereby proving the independence of the Turaev-Viro invariant under pivotal Morita equivalence without recurring to the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction.
  A key ingredient for the construction is the evaluation of graphs on the sphere with labels in $\mathbf{Mod}^{\mathrm{sph}}(\mathcal{A})$ that we develop in this article. A central tool are Nakayama-twisted traces on pivotal bimodule categories which we study beyond semisimplicity.</description>

      <title>Homology of strict polynomial functors over Fp-linear additive categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the strong comparison theorem of Franjou, Friedlander, Scorichenko and Suslin to the setting of Fp-linear additive categories. Our results have a strong impact in terms of explicit computations of functor homology, and they open the way to new applications to stable homology of groups or to K-theory. As an illustration, we prove comparison theorems between cohomologies of classical algebraic groups over infinite perfect fields, in the spirit of a celebrated result of Cline, Parshall, Scott et van der Kallen for finite fields.</description>

      <title>Pattern runs on matter: The free monad monad as a module over the cofree comonad comonad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interviews run on people, programs run on operating systems, voting schemes run on voters, games run on players. Each of these is an example of the abstraction pattern runs on matter. Pattern determines the decision tree that governs how a situation can unfold, while matter responds with decisions at each juncture.
  In this article, we will give a straightforward and concrete construction of the free monad monad for $(\mathbf{Poly}, \mathbin{\triangleleft}, \mathcal{y})$, the category of polynomial functors with the substitution monoidal product. Although the free monad has been well-studied in other contexts, the construction we give is streamlined and explicitly illustrates how the free monad represents terminating decision trees. We will also explore the naturally arising interaction between the free monad and cofree comonad. Again, while the interaction itself is known, the perspective we take is the free monad as a module over the cofree comonad. Lastly, we will give four applications of the module action to interviews, computer programs, voting, and games. In each example, we will see how the free monad represents pattern, the cofree comonad represents matter, and the module action represents runs on.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of noncommutative motives and secondary algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a universal characterization of the construction taking a scheme $X$ to its stable $\infty$-category $\text{Mot}(X)$ of noncommutative motives, patterned after the universal characterization of algebraic K-theory due to Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada. As a consequence, we obtain a corepresentability theorem for secondary K-theory. We envision this as a fundamental tool for the construction of trace maps from secondary K-theory.
  Towards these main goals, we introduce a preliminary formalism of "stable $(\infty, 2)$-categories"; notable examples of these include (quasicoherent or constructible) sheaves of stable $\infty$-categories. We also develop the rudiments of a theory of presentable enriched $\infty$-categories -- and in particular, a theory of presentable $(\infty, n)$-categories -- which may be of intependent interest.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic sets as a model of homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets are presheaves on a rich category of shapes, whose definition is motivated by combinatorial topology and higher-dimensional diagram rewriting. These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray products, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated model structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen equivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We construct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, and prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of diagrammatic sets.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606241</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>
