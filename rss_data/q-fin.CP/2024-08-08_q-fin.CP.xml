      <title>Consumer Transactions Simulation through Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of large-scale retail data systems, envisioning and simulating future consumer transactions has become a crucial area of interest. It offers significant potential to fortify demand forecasting and fine-tune inventory management. This paper presents an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic retail transaction data, specifically focusing on a novel system architecture that combines consumer behavior modeling with stock-keeping unit (SKU) availability constraints to address real-world assortment optimization challenges. We diverge from conventional methodologies by integrating SKU data into our GAN architecture and using more sophisticated embedding methods (e.g., hyper-graphs). This design choice enables our system to generate not only simulated consumer purchase behaviors but also reflects the dynamic interplay between consumer behavior and SKU availability -- an aspect often overlooked, among others, because of data scarcity in legacy retail simulation models. Our GAN model generates transactions under stock constraints, pioneering a resourceful experimental system with practical implications for real-world retail operation and strategy. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced realism in simulated transactions measured by comparing generated items with real ones using methods employed earlier in related studies. This underscores the potential for more accurate predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and price impact in the fluid-limit of an order book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a Discrete Time Random Walk (DTRW) numerical scheme to simulate the anomalous diffusion of financial market orders in a simulated order book. Here using random walks with Sibuya waiting times to include a time-dependent stochastic forcing function with non-uniformly sampled times between order book events in the setting of fractional diffusion. This models the fluid limit of an order book by modelling the continuous arrival, cancellation and diffusion of orders in the presence of information shocks. We study the impulse response and stylised facts of orders undergoing anomalous diffusion for different forcing functions and model parameters. Concretely, we demonstrate the price impact for flash limit-orders and market orders and show how the numerical method generate kinks in the price impact. We use cubic spline interpolation to generate smoothed price impact curves. The work promotes the use of non-uniform sampling in the presence of diffusive dynamics as the preferred simulation method.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
