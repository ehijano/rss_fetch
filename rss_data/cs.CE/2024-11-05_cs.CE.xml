      <title>Hedging and Pricing Structured Products Featuring Multiple Underlying Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedging a portfolio containing autocallable notes presents unique challenges due to the complex risk profile of these financial instruments. In addition to hedging, pricing these notes, particularly when multiple underlying assets are involved, adds another layer of complexity. Pricing autocallable notes involves intricate considerations of various risk factors, including underlying assets, interest rates, and volatility. Traditional pricing methods, such as sample-based Monte Carlo simulations, are often time-consuming and impractical for long maturities, particularly when there are multiple underlying assets. In this paper, we explore autocallable structured notes with three underlying assets and proposes a machine learning-based pricing method that significantly improves efficiency, computing prices 250 times faster than traditional Monte Carlo simulation based method. Additionally, we introduce a Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to hedge a portfolio containing an autocallable structured note. Our distributional RL based hedging strategy provides better PnL compared to traditional Delta-neutral and Delta-Gamma neutral hedging strategies. The VaR 5% (PnL value) of our RL agent based hedging is 33.95, significantly outperforming both the Delta neutral strategy, which has a VaR 5% of -0.04, and the Delta-Gamma neutral strategy, which has a VaR 5% of 13.05. It also provides the hedging action with better left tail PnL, such as 95% and 99% value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), highlighting its potential for front-office hedging and risk management.</description>

      <title>TDS Simulator: A MATLAB App to model temperature-programmed hydrogen desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TDS Simulator, a new software tool aimed at modelling thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments. TDS is a widely used technique for quantifying key characteristics of hydrogen-material interactions, such as diffusivity and trapping. However, interpreting the output of TDS experiments is non-trivial and requires appropriate post-processing tools. This work introduces the first software tool capable of simulating TDS curves for arbitrary choices of material parameters and hydrogen trap characteristics, using the primary hydrogen diffusion and trapping models (Oriani, McNabb-Foster). Moreover, TDS Simulator contains a specific functionality for loading experimental TDS data and conducting the inverse calibration of a selected transport model, providing automatic estimates of the density and binding energy of each hydrogen trap type in the material. In its first version, TDS Simulator is provided as a MATLAB App, which is made freely available to the community and provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make use of TDS Simulator straightforward. As reported in the present manuscript, the outputs of TDS Simulator have been extensively validated against literature data. Demonstrations of automatic determination of trap characteristics from experimental data through the optimisation tool are also provided. The present work enables an efficient and straightforward characterisation of hydrogen-material characteristics relevant to multiple applications, from nuclear fusion to the development of hydrogen-compatible materials for the hydrogen economy. TDS Simulator can be downloaded from https://mechmat.web.ox.ac.uk/codes.</description>

      <title>PMI-DT: Leveraging Digital Twins and Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling and Inspection in Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, Digital Twin (DT) has become popular in Advanced Manufacturing (AM) due to its ability to improve production efficiency and quality. By creating virtual replicas of physical assets, DTs help in real-time monitoring, develop predictive models, and improve operational performance. However, integrating data from physical systems into reliable predictive models, particularly in precision measurement and failure prevention, is often challenging and less explored. This study introduces a Predictive Maintenance and Inspection Digital Twin (PMI-DT) framework with a focus on precision measurement and predictive quality assurance using 3D-printed 1''-4 ACME bolt, CyberGage 360 vision inspection system, SolidWorks, and Microsoft Azure. During this approach, dimensional inspection data is combined with fatigue test results to create a model for detecting failures. Using Machine Learning (ML) -- Random Forest and Decision Tree models -- the proposed approaches were able to predict bolt failure with real-time data 100% accurately. Our preliminary result shows Max Position (30%) and Max Load (24%) are the main factors that contribute to that failure. We expect the PMI-DT framework will reduce inspection time and improve predictive maintenance, ultimately giving manufacturers a practical way to boost product quality and reliability using DT in AM.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution, US-scale Digital Similar of Interacting Livestock, Wild Birds, and Human Ecosystems with Applications to Multi-host Epidemic Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One Health issues, such as the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), present significant challenges at the intersection of human, animal, and environmental health. Recent H5N1 outbreaks underscore the need for comprehensive modeling that capture the complex interactions between various entities in these interconnected ecosystems, encompassing livestock, wild birds, and human populations. To support such efforts, we present a synthetic spatiotemporal gridded dataset for the contiguous United States, referred to as a digital similar. The methodology for constructing this digital similar involves fusing diverse datasets using statistical and optimization techniques. The livestock component includes farm-level representations of multiple livestock types -- cattle, poultry, hogs, and sheep -- including further categorization into subtypes, such as milk and beef cows, chicken, turkeys, ducks, etc. It also includes location-level data for livestock-product processing centers. Weekly abundance data for key wild bird species involved in avian flu transmission are included along with temporal networks of movements. Gridded distributions of the human population, along with demographic and occupational features, capture the placement of agricultural workers and the general population. The digital similar is verified and validated in multiple ways.This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive basis for modeling complex phenomena at the wild-domestic-human interfaces.</description>

      <title>Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent Trading Performance in Forex using Auxiliary Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced algorithms based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been able to become a reliable tool for the Forex market traders and provide a suitable strategy for maximizing profit and reducing trading risk. These tools try to find the most profitable strategy in this market by examining past market data. Artificial intelligent agents based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, one of the DRL algorithms, have shown a special ability to determine a profitable strategy. In this research, to increase profitability and determine the optimal strategy for the PPO, an auxiliary task has been used. The auxiliary function helps the PPO to model the reward function in a better way by recognizing and classifying patterns to obtain additional information from the problem's inputs and data. The results of simulation and backtesting on the EUR/USD currency pair have shown that the new proposed model has been able to increase the overall return from -25.25% to 14.86% and the value of sharp ratio from -2.61 to 0.24 in dataset 1 and increased overall return from 2.12% to 42.22% and the value of sharp ratio from -2.93 to 0.47 in dataset 2. These results indicate better identification of trends, timely trading, and great improvement in risk reduction while increasing the profit. It has also reduced the transaction risk and can be used as an effective tool for automatic trading in the complex forex market</description>

      <title>Leveraging Microservices Architecture for Dynamic Pricing in the Travel Industry: Algorithms, Scalability, and Impact on Revenue and Customer Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the implementation of a real-time, microservices-oriented dynamic pricing system for the travel sector. The system is designed to address factors such as demand, competitor pricing, and other external circumstances in real-time. Both controlled simulation and real-life application showed a respectable gain of 22% in revenue generation and a 17% improvement in pricing response time which concern the issues of scaling and flexibility of classical pricing mechanisms. Demand forecasting, competitor pricing strategies, and event-based pricing were implemented as separate microservices to enhance their scalability and reduce resource consumption by 30% during peak loads. Customers were also more content as depicted by a 15% increase in satisfaction score post-implementation given the appreciation of more appropriate pricing. This research enhances the existing literature with practical illustrations of the possible application of microservices technology in developing dynamic pricing solutions in a complex and data-driven context. There exist however areas for improvement for instance inter-service latency and the need for extensive real-time data pipelines. The present research goes on to suggest combining these with direct data capture from customer behavior at the same time as machine learning capacity developments in pricing algorithms to assist in more accurate real time pricing. It is determined that the use of microservices is a reasonable and efficient model for dynamic pricing, allowing the tourism sector to employ evidence-based and customer centric pricing techniques, which ensures that their profits are not jeopardized because of the need for customers.</description>

      <title>Datasets for Advanced Bankruptcy Prediction: A survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bankruptcy prediction is an important research area that heavily relies on data science. It aims to help investors, managers, and regulators better understand the operational status of corporations and predict potential financial risks in advance. To improve prediction, researchers and practitioners have begun to utilize a variety of different types of data, ranging from traditional financial indicators to unstructured data, to aid in the construction and optimization of bankruptcy forecasting models. Over time, not only instrumentalized data improved, but also instrumentalized methodology for data structuring, cleaning, and analysis. With the aid of advanced analytical techniques that deploy machine learning and deep learning algorithms, bankruptcy assessment became more accurate over time. However, due to the sensitivity of financial data, the scarcity of valid public datasets remains a key bottleneck for the rapid modeling and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for targeted tasks. This study therefore introduces a taxonomy of datasets for bankruptcy research, and summarizes their characteristics. This paper also proposes a set of metrics to measure the quality and the informativeness of public datasets The taxonomy, coupled with the informativeness measure, thus aims at providing valuable insights to better assist researchers and practitioners in developing potential applications for various aspects of credit assessment and decision making by pointing at appropriate datasets for their studies.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric Inference for Diffusion Processes: A Computational Approach via Bayesian Inversion for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical and computational workflow for the non-parametric Bayesian inference of drift and diffusion functions of autonomous diffusion processes. We base the inference on the partial differential equations arising from the infinitesimal generator of the underlying process. Following a problem formulation in the infinite-dimensional setting, we discuss optimization- and sampling-based solution methods. As preliminary results, we showcase the inference of a single-scale, as well as a multiscale process from trajectory data.</description>

      <title>A Flight-Mechanics Solver for Aircraft Inverse Simulations and Application to 3D Mirage-III Maneuver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to present a general mathematical model and an associated numerical algorithm applicable to an arbitrary fixed-wing fixed-mass aircraft undergoing an arbitrary maneuver, based on the 3D nonlinear coupled differential-algebraic equations of motion, including force, moment, kinematic and constraint equations. The model is formulated to address the inverse simulation problem where a target maneuver is prescribed and the corresponding time dependent patterns of the control variables are solved for to meet this maneuver. The model utilizes two different moving frames of references, namely the body axes and the wind axes. The numerical algorithm features sequential solution of equations in a fully explicit manner. It is straightforward to use the model in a reverse mode, namely the direct simulation problem. The inverse problem may be summarized as follows: Inputs: Time history of desired-trajectory rectangular coordinates relative to the ground-fixed axes. A constraint should be specified, which we arbitrarily chose it to be the bank angle. Also, certain geometric and aerodynamic aircraft data are needed. Outputs: Time history of the control variables (thrust magnitude, elevator angle, rudder angle, ailerons angle), which will satisfy the aimed trajectory. The paper finally applies the presented numerical algorithm to a roll maneuver for the Mirage-III fighter.</description>

      <title>AAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For data-constrained, complex and dynamic industrial environments, there is a critical need for transferable and multimodal methodologies to enhance anomaly detection and therefore, prevent costs associated with system failures. Typically, traditional PdM approaches are not transferable or multimodal. This work examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection in complex and dynamic manufacturing systems. The research aims to improve the transferability of anomaly detection models by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and seeks to validate the enhanced effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-sparse industrial applications. The research also seeks to enable more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators by allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics. Additionally, the research aims to address the issue of concept drift in dynamic industrial settings by integrating an adaptability mechanism. The literature review examines the latest developments in LLM time series tasks alongside associated adaptive anomaly detection methods to establish a robust theoretical framework for the proposed architecture. This paper presents a novel model framework (AAD-LLM) that doesn't require any training or finetuning on the dataset it is applied to and is multimodal. Results suggest that anomaly detection can be converted into a "language" task to deliver effective, context-aware detection in data-constrained industrial applications. This work, therefore, contributes significantly to advancements in anomaly detection methodologies.</description>

      <title>AGISim, An Open Source Airborne Gimbal Mounted IMU Signal Simulator Considering Flight Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present more comprehensive evaluations on our airborne Gimbal mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) signal simulator which also considers flight dynamic model (FDM). A flexible IMU signal simulator is an enabling tool in design, development, improvement, test and verification of aided inertial navigation systems (INS). Efforts by other researchers had been concentrated on simulation of the strapdown INS (SINS) with the IMU rigidly attached to the moving body frame. However custom airborne surveying/mapping applications that need pointing and stabilizing camera or any other surveying sensor, require mounting the IMU beside the sensor on a Gimbal onboard the airframe. Hence the proposed Gimbal mounted IMU signal simulator is of interest whilst itself requires further analysis and verifications. Extended evaluation results in terms of both unit tests and functional/integration tests (using aided inertial navigation algorithms with variable/dynamic lever arms), verifies the simulator and its applicability for the mentioned tasks. We have further packaged and published our MATLAB code for the proposed simulator as an open source GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Hyperbox Mixture Regression for Process Performance Prediction in Antibody Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of predicting bioprocess performance, particularly in monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, where conventional statistical methods often fall short due to time-series data's complexity and high dimensionality. We propose a novel Hyperbox Mixture Regression (HMR) model which employs hyperbox-based input space partitioning to enhance predictive accuracy while managing uncertainty inherent in bioprocess data. The HMR model is designed to dynamically generate hyperboxes for input samples in a single-pass process, thereby improving learning speed and reducing computational complexity. Our experimental study utilizes a dataset that contains 106 bioreactors. This study evaluates the model's performance in predicting critical quality attributes in monoclonal antibody manufacturing over a 15-day cultivation period. The results demonstrate that the HMR model outperforms comparable approximators in accuracy and learning speed and maintains interpretability and robustness under uncertain conditions. These findings underscore the potential of HMR as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive analytics in bioprocessing applications.</description>

      <title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving reasoning over quantities, especially arithmetics. This has particular relevance in scientific datasets where combinations of text and numerical data are abundant. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the CE loss, which assumes a nominal (categorical) scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. As a remedy, we here present two versions of a number token loss. The first is based on an $L_p$ loss between the ground truth token value and the weighted sum of the predicted class probabilities. The second loss minimizes the Wasserstein-1 distance between the distribution of the predicted output probabilities and the ground truth distribution. These regression-like losses can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training. We compare the proposed schemes on a mathematics dataset against existing tokenization, encoding, and decoding schemes for improving number representation in language models. Our results reveal a significant improvement in numerical accuracy when equipping a standard T5 model with the proposed loss schemes.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining effective representations of DNA sequences is crucial for genome analysis. Metagenomic binning, for instance, relies on genome representations to cluster complex mixtures of DNA fragments from biological samples with the aim of determining their microbial compositions. In this paper, we revisit k-mer-based representations of genomes and provide a theoretical analysis of their use in representation learning. Based on the analysis, we propose a lightweight and scalable model for performing metagenomic binning at the genome read level, relying only on the k-mer compositions of the DNA fragments. We compare the model to recent genome foundation models and demonstrate that while the models are comparable in performance, the proposed model is significantly more effective in terms of scalability, a crucial aspect for performing metagenomic binning of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>From x*y=k to Uniswap Hooks: A Comparative Review of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10162</link>

Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are pivotal applications in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape, aiming to facilitate trustless cryptocurrency trading by relying on smart contracts and blockchain networks. The developments in the DEXs sector began with the implementation of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) system using a simple math formula by Uniswap in 2018. Absorbing significant funding and the attention of web3 enthusiasts, DEXs have seen numerous advancements in their evolution. A notable recent advancement is the introduction of hooks in Uniswap v4, which allows users to take advantage of a wide range of plugin-like features with liquidity pools. This paper provides a comprehensive classification and comparative analyses of prominent DEX protocols, namely Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer, in addition to investigating other protocols' noteworthy aspects. The evaluation framework encompasses mechanisms, components, mathematical formulations, and the performance of liquidity pools. The goals are to elucidate the strengths and limitations of different AMM models, highlight emerging concepts in DEX development, outline current challenges, and differentiate optimal models for specific applications. The results and comparative insights can be a reference for web3 developers, blockchain researchers, traders, and regulatory parties.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation for the POD formulation of the parametric laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>

Abstract: A posteriori reduced-order models (ROM), e.g. based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), are essential to affordably tackle realistic parametric problems. They rely on a trustful training set, that is a family of full-order solutions (snapshots) representative of all possible outcomes of the parametric problem. Having such a rich collection of snapshots is not, in many cases, computationally viable. A strategy for data augmentation, designed for parametric laminar incompressible flows, is proposed to enrich poorly populated training sets. The goal is to include in the new, artificial snapshots emerging features, not present in the original basis, that do enhance the quality of the reduced basis (RB) constructed using POD dimensionality reduction. The methodologies devised are based on exploiting basic physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation, to construct physically-relevant, artificial snapshots at a fraction of the cost of additional full-order solutions. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the ideas exploiting only mass conservation (i.e., incompressibility) are not producing significant added value with respect to the standard linear combinations of snapshots. Conversely, accounting for the linearized momentum balance via the Oseen equation does improve the quality of the resulting approximation and therefore is an effective data augmentation strategy in the framework of viscous incompressible laminar flows. Numerical experiments of parametric flow problems, in two and three dimensions, at low and moderate values of the Reynolds number are presented to showcase the superior performance of the data-enriched POD-RB with respect to the standard ROM in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Model Based Approach for Evaluating Task-Competence of Antagonistic Continuum Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robot arms have made significant progress towards completing human-scale tasks, but designing arms for tasks with specific load and workspace requirements remains difficult. A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data. As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods. Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</description>
