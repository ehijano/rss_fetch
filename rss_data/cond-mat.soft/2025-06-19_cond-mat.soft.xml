      <title>Inverse method for determining general molecular weight distribution from polymer rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determination of polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) from rheological measurements is desirable due to the ease and low cost of rheometry compared to other methods such as gel permeation chromatography. However, relating MWD to rheology requires the inversion of rheological models, for which there is no analytic solution. Prior approaches assume a functional form for the MWD (such as a lognormal or generalized exponential distribution), minimizing the error with respect to the functional form's degrees of freedom. While this is a powerful and robust technique for determining general polymer properties, such as average MWD or polydispersity, it requires former knowledge of the shape of the MWD. This work presents a generalized approach to solving the inverse problem directly, with no former knowledge of the MWD or assumptions regarding its functional form. To close the inverse problem and establish uniqueness, Lagrange multipliers constraints on the MWD are included. The method is applied with reptation-based models to a variety of polycarbonate, polyethylene and polystyrene polymers. For samples whose rheology are well-described by reptation, the predicted MWD is shown to match experimental measurements very well. For samples that are not well-described by reptation, the predicted MWD naturally differs from experiment. Nevertheless, the results still offer insight into how reptation-described polymers differ from their counterparts. This establishes the proposed inverse method as a viable practical tool for rheology-based characterization.</description>

      <title>Segregation and cooperation in active colloidal binary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interactions underlying collective motion in biological systems give rise to emergent behaviours such as flocking, sorting, and cooperative transport. These dynamics often involve species with different motilities coordinating movement to optimize navigation and survival. Synthetic analogues based on active colloids offer a controlled platform to explore such behaviours, yet most experimental realizations remain limited to monodisperse systems or mixtures of passive and active particles. Here, we investigate dense binary mixtures of active Janus colloids with distinct motilities and independently tunable alignment, actuated by AC electric fields. We demonstrate experimentally and numerically that both species form highly dynamic polar clusters, with alignment emerging independently of propulsion speed. In mixed populations, interspecies interactions lead to effective segregation and cooperative motion, including transient enhancement of slower particle motility. Our results reveal how motility contrast and alignment combine to drive self-organization in active mixtures, offering strategies for designing reconfigurable materials with collective functionalities.</description>

      <title>Autonomous life-like behavior emerging in active and flexible microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many organisms leverage an interplay between shape and activity to generate motion and adapt to their environment. Embedding such feedback into synthetic microrobots could eliminate the need for sensors, software, and actuators, yet current realizations are either active but rigid, or flexible but passive. Here, we introduce micrometer-scale structures that integrate both activity and flexibility by 3D microprinting concatenated units and actuating them with an AC electric field. This minimal yet versatile design gives rise to a rich array of life-like modes of motion - including railway and undulatory locomotion, rotation, and beating - as well as emergent sense-response abilities, which enable autonomous reorientation, navigation, and collision avoidance. Our approach offers a versatile platform for designing biomimetic model systems and autonomously operating microrobots with embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Algal Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly a decade ago it was discovered that the spherical cell body of the alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ can act as a lens to concentrate incoming light onto the cell's membrane-bound photoreceptor and thereby affect phototaxis. Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have complex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental, yet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by the bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such questions: the $absorption$ problem for $incoming$ light, typified by photosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and the $emission$ problem for $outgoing$ light, where the paradigm is bioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates. Here we examine both of these aspects of ``algal optics" in the special case where the absorption or emission is localized in structures that are small relative to the overall organism size, taking into account both refraction and reflections at the cell-water boundary. Analytical and numerical results are developed for the distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we establish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing problems. For strongly non-spherical shapes we find lensing effects that may have implications for photosynthetic activity and for the angular distribution of light emitted during bioluminescent flashes.</description>

      <title>Devitrification and Melting Dynamics in Vapor Deposited Water Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibration dynamics of ultrastable glasses subjected to heating protocols has attracted recent experimental and theoretical interest. With simulations of the mW water model, we investigate the devitrification and melting dynamics of both conventional quenched (QG) and vapor deposited (DG) amorphous ices under controlled heating ramps. By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlates with the structural stability of the glasses and allows tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. Additionally, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1+d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.</description>

      <title>Learning to flock in open space by avoiding collisions and staying together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cohesive flocking in open, boundless space using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.</description>

      <title>Determining the chemical potential via universal density functional learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of an implicit loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical training data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based prediction of dynamical clustering in granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dense granular gases are continuously excited under microgravity conditions, spatial inhomogeneities of the particle number density can emerge. A significant share of particles may collect in strongly overpopulated regions, called clusters. This dynamical clustering, or gas-cluster transition, is caused by a complex interplay and balance between the energy influx and dissipation in particle collisions. Particle number density, container geometry, and excitation strength influence this transition. We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for ensembles of frictional spheres in a cuboid container and apply the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and a caging criterion to the local packing fraction profiles to detect clusters. Machine learning can be used to study the gas-cluster transition, and can be a promising alternative to identify the state of the system for a given set of system parameters without time-consuming complex DEM simulations. We test various machine learning models and identify the best models to predict dynamical clustering of frictional spheres in a specific experimental geometry.</description>

      <title>Slip flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the treatment of varicose veins with aqueous foams, we determine the velocity profiles and yield surface positions for pressure-driven flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels, incorporating Navier wall slip to capture the slip behavior of aqueous foams. Assuming a constant pressure gradient -- consistent with syringe-driven injection in sclerotherapy -- we reproduce a closed-form analytic solution for the flow in a straight channel, and extend this to a uniformly curved channel consisting of a section of an annulus. We find that increasing the slip length in the curved channel moves the unyielded fluid, or plug, towards the inside of the channel and slightly decreases the plug width. Channels with a change in curvature are tackled numerically, with a procedure that is validated against the analytic results. We solve for the flow of a Bingham fluid in the transition region between a straight and a uniformly curved channel and in a non-uniform sinusoidal channel where the wall curvature changes continuously. We find that there is greater yielding of the fluid in curved channels, caused by an increase in the shear stresses. As the slip length increases, there is a reduction in the area of unyielded fluid in regions of high wall curvature. In the context of varicose vein sclerotherapy, our results suggest that slip has both positive and negative consequences: it reduces the possibility of static regions of foam developing in areas of high curvature in the vein, but also reduces the plug width in general, reducing the efficacy with which the foam displaces blood from the vein.</description>

      <title>Advanced Langevin thermostats: Properties, extensions to rheology, and a lean momentum-conserving approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation accounts for unresolved bath degrees of freedom driving the system toward the bath temperature. Because of this, numerical solutions of the Langevin equation have a long history. Here, we recapitulate, combine, and extend existing Langevin-equation based thermostats, scrutinize their properties and demonstrate their superiority over global kinetic-energy controls. Our work includes compact, asymptotic-analysis based derivations of stochastic thermostats, including the highly accurate Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen scheme. Proposed extensions include a precise, colored and a lean, momentum-conserving thermostat.</description>

Abstract: A single light-driven Janus particle confined in a very thin oil droplet at an air--water interface displays intriguing dynamics. While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet.</description>

      <title>A Fluctuation Theory of Liquid-Phase Solutions: Shear Viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant challenge in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across the glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), is investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from an unpaired electron to a nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate $1/T_\mu$ measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields is analyzed using the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter $\nu$ is evaluated over a temperature $T$ range of 5-320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and preexponential factor are in good agreement with those for the "elemental process" revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three carbon-carbon bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling at the atomic scale.</description>
