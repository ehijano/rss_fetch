      <title>Local-Order-Invariant Logic on Classes of Bounded Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local-order-invariant (first-order) logic is an extension of first-order logic where formulae have access to a ternary local order relation on the Gaifman graph, provided that the truth value does not depend on the specific order relation chosen. Weinstein asked a number of questions about the expressive power of order-invariant and local-order-invariant logics on classes of finite structures of bounded degree, classes of finite structures in general, and classes of locally finite structures. We answer four of his five questions, including showing that local-order-invariant logic collapses to first-order logic on classes of bounded degree. We also investigate epsilon-invariant logic. We show that epsilon-invariant logic collapses to first-order logic on classes of bounded degree by containing it in local-order-invariant logic in this setting, and we give an upper bound for epsilon-invariant logic in terms of local-order-invariant logic on general finite structures. Finally, in the process of proving these theorems, we demonstrate some principles which suggest further directions for showing upper bounds on invariant logics, including an upper bound on epsilon-invariant logic in general.</description>

      <title>Logic of Sets with Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbit-finite models of computation generalise the standard models of computation, to allow computation over infinite objects that are finite up to symmetries on atoms, denoted by $\mathbb{A}$. Set theory with atoms is used to reason about these objects. Recent work assumes that $\mathbb{A}$ is countable and that the symmetries are the automorphisms of a structure on $\mathbb{A}$. We study this set theory to understand generalisations of this approach. We show that: this construction is well-defined and sufficiently expressive; and that automorphism groups are adequate.
  Certain uncountable structures appear similar to countable structures, suggesting that the theory of orbit-finite constructions may apply to these uncountable structures. We prove results guaranteeing that the theory of symmetries of two structures are equal. Let: $PM(\mathcal{A})$ be the universe of symmetries induced by adding atoms in bijection with $\mathcal{A}$ and considering the symmetric universe; $\underline{\mathcal{A}}$ be the image of $\mathcal{A}$ on the atoms; and $\phi ^{PM(\mathcal{A})}$ be the relativisation of $\phi$ to $PM(\mathcal{A})$. We prove that all symmetric universes of equality atoms have theory $Th(PM(\left\langle \mathbb{N}\right\rangle))$. We prove that for structures $\mathcal{A}$, `nicely' covered by a set of cardinality $\kappa$, there is a structure $\mathcal{B}\equiv\mathcal{A}$ of size $\kappa$ such that for all formulae $\phi(x)$ in one variable, \begin{equation*}
  ZFC\vdash \phi(\underline{\mathcal{A}})^{PM(\mathcal{A})}\leftrightarrow\phi(\underline{\mathcal{B}})^{PM(\mathcal{B})} \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>On the problem of stability of abstract elementary classes of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an open problem of Mazari-Armida whether every abstract elementary class of $R$-modules $(\mathbf{K}, \leq_{\mathrm{pure}})$, with $\leq_{\mathrm{pure}}$ the pure submodule relation, is stable. We answer this question in the negative by constructing unstable abstract elementary classes $(\mathbf{K}, \leq_{\mathrm{pure}})$ of torsion-free abelian groups. On the other hand, we prove (in $\mathrm{ZFC}$) that if $R$ is any ring and $(\mathbf{K}, \preccurlyeq)$ is an abstract elementary class of $R$-modules which is $\kappa$-local (also called $\kappa$-tame) for some $\kappa \geq \mathrm{LS}(\mathbf{K}, \preccurlyeq)$, then $(\mathbf{K}, \preccurlyeq)$ is almost stable, where almost stability is a new notion of independent interest that we introduce in this paper, and which is equivalent to the usual notion of stability under the assumption of amalgamation. As a consequence, assuming the existence of a strongly compact cardinal $\kappa$, we have that every abstract elementary class $(\mathbf{K}, \preccurlyeq)$ of $R$-modules with amalgamation satisfying $\kappa &gt; \mathrm{LS}(\mathbf{K}, \preccurlyeq)$ is stable.</description>

      <title>Transcendence degrees over mutually generic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_0$,..., $G_{n-1}$ be mutually generic over $V$, each $G_i$ adding at least one new real over $V$. We show that the transcendence degree of the reals of $V[G_0, \dots, G_{n-1}]$ is maximal (of size continuum) over the field generated by reals coming from models $V[ G_i : i \in a]$, for a proper subset $a$ of $n$. This answers a question of Fatalini and Schindler.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey Degrees in Ultraproducts of Finite Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a transfer principle of structural Ramsey theory from finite structures to ultraproducts. We show that under certain mild conditions, when a class of finite structures has finite small Ramsey degrees, under the (Generalized) Continuum Hypothesis the ultraproduct has finite big Ramsey degrees for internal colorings. The necessity of restricting to internal colorings is demonstrated by the example of the ultraproduct of finite linear orders. Under CH, this ultraproduct $\fLL^*$ has, as a spine, $\eta_1$, an uncountable analogue of the order type of rationals $\eta$. Finite big Ramsey degrees for $\eta$ were exactly calculated by Devlin in \cite{Devlin}. It is immediate from \cite{Tod87} that $\eta_1$ fails to have finite big Ramsey degrees. Moreover, we extend Devlin's coloring to $\eta_1$ to show that it witnesses big Ramsey degrees of finite tuples in $\eta$ on every copy of $\eta$ in $\eta_1,$ and consequently in $\fLL^*$. This work gives additional confirmation that ultraproducts are a suitable environment for studying Ramsey properties of finite and infinite structures.</description>

Abstract: We show that the classes of partial isometries in finite-dimensional polyhedral spaces and in finite-dimensional rational polyhedral spaces do not have the weak amalgamation property. This implies that the linear isometry group of the rational Gurarii space does not have a comeager conjugacy class. Our methods demonstrate also that the classes of finite-dimensional polyhedral spaces and of finite-dimensional rational polyhedral spaces fail to have the Hrushovski property.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for every Coxeter diagram $D$ with no rank $3$ residues of spherical type and such that $D$ has not only edges labelled by $2$, the space of countable (Tits) buildings of type $D$ is Borel complete, that is, classifying countable buildings of type $D$ up to isomorphism is as hard as classifying countable graphs up to isomorphism. In particular, for every $n\geq 3$, the space of countable generalised $n$-gons is Borel complete.</description>

      <title>Structures of uninorms on bounded lattices via t-conorms, closure operators and t-subnorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide some structures of uninorms on bounded lattices via t-conorms, closure operators and t-subnorms, subject to certain constraints on the closure operators and t-subnorms. Importantly, these constraints are shown to be both sufficient and necessary. That is, the proposed methods reveal clear relationships between the structure of the resulting uninorms and the properties of the underlying components. Meanwhile, we present the degenerate cases of the aforementioned results, which are constructed using special closure operators and t-subnorms. Some of these cases correspond to well-known results documented in the literature. Moreover, the dual constructions of uninorms on bounded lattices, based on t-norms, interior operators and t-superconorms, are presented simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical Complexity and Absoluteness of Rigidity Phenomena for Ulam Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the logical complexity and absoluteness of natural statements about Ulam sequences, with particular emphasis on the rigidity phenomena introduced by Hinman, Kuca, Schlesinger and Sheydvasser for the family $U(1,n)$. For each pair of coprime integers $a&lt;b$ we view the associated Ulam sequence $U(a,b)$ as a recursive subset of $\mathbb{N}$ and consider expansions of the form $(\mathbb{N},+,\mathrm{U}_{a,b})$.
  Our first main result is a uniform coding of Ulam sequences and of the ``interval with periodic mask'' patterns appearing in rigidity conjectures into first-order arithmetic. Using this, we show that the strong rigidity, regularity (eventual periodicity of gaps), and density statements for $U(a,b)$ are all arithmetical and lie at low levels of the arithmetical hierarchy (e.g.\ $\Sigma^0_2$ or $\Pi^0_3$).
  As a consequence, these statements are absolute between transitive models of $\mathrm{ZFC}$ with the same natural numbers: their truth value cannot be changed by forcing, and is independent of the Continuum Hypothesis and large cardinal axioms. We also study the expansions $(\mathbb{N},+,\mathrm{U}_{a,b})$ model-theoretically, showing that combinatorial rigidity implies tameness properties (NIP, dp-minimality, non-interpretability of multiplcation).</description>

      <title>The Dual of Quantifier Elimination: Boolean Elimination over C and R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every finite Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities in C^n admits two uniform normal forms: an $\exists\forall$ form and a $\forall\exists$ form, each using a single polynomial equation. Both forms have one existentially quantified variable and one universally quantified variable; regardless of the complexity of the original formula, no longer quantifier blocks are needed. The constructions are explicit and have linear degree bounds. Optimality results demonstrate that no purely existential or universal normal form is possible over C.
  Over R, similar normal forms exist, including a singly-quantified $\exists$ form for Boolean combinations of equations and inequations, and $\exists^d$ and $\forall\exists$ forms for Boolean combinations involving order inequalities. Prior results establish the existence of a $\exists$ normal form for R by other methods. Finally, similar forms exist over Q as well.
  These results may be viewed as a dual to classical quantifier elimination: instead of removing quantifiers at the cost of increased Boolean complexity, they remove Boolean structure at the cost of a short, fixed quantifier prefix.</description>
