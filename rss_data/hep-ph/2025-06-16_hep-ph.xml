      <title>Multiple Soft Scatterings in Scalar Dark Matter Freeze-In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the freeze-in production rate for scalar dark matter (DM) from a gauge-charged parent particle via a renormalizable interaction. Building on the previously developed 1PI-resummed framework to accurately capture the relevant regime $T \sim M$, we expand the analysis to include the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, which contributes at leading order $g^2 T$ to the interaction rate in the ultra-relativistic limit. To this end, we derive an equation for the LPM rate of a scalar particle for the first time and combine it with the previous 1PI results, providing a new state-of-the art calculation. In contrast to the 1PI results, the LPM treatment neglects vacuum mass scales such that a phenomenological switch-off function between the ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic regime is required. We propose a new function motivated by a thermal loop contribution and compare it to other approaches in the literature, quantifying the resulting uncertainty of this method. Depending on the gauge coupling and mass splitting between DM and mediator particles, the LPM effect contributes between 1% and 27% to the relic density, with the impact increasing for larger gauge couplings and smaller mass splittings. Additionally, we compare our results to commonly used semi-classical Boltzmann approaches. For instance, when these include decays and scatterings regulated with thermal masses, we find deviations ranging from -30% to +20% depending on the mass splitting. Finally, we compare to results based on hard-thermal-loop (HTL) approximations.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Scattering of Sub-GeV Dark Matter: Models and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the scattering rate of sub-GeV dark matter in solid-state targets for spin-dependent dark matter -- nucleon interactions. For dark matter particles with mass below 100 MeV, the scattering occurs predominantly through incoherent phonon production. For dark matter heavier than 100 MeV, we match onto the nuclear recoil calculation. To compare the sensitivity of future direct detection experiments with existing constraints, we consider three models with interactions which are mediated by spin-0 or spin-1 particles. This allows us to derive bounds on the cross section from searches for the mediating particle, including bounds from stellar cooling, beam dump experiments, meson factories and dark matter self-interactions. The existing bounds are very stringent, though for $m_\chi\gtrsim 100$ MeV there is parameter space which may be accessible with direct detection, depending on the exposure and background rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose searching for physics beyond the Standard Model in the low-transverse-momentum tracks accompanying hard-scatter events at the LHC. TeV-scale resonances connected to a dark QCD sector could be enhanced by selecting events with anomalies in the track distributions. As a benchmark, a quirk model with microscopic string lengths is developed, including a setup for event simulation. For this model, strategies are presented to enhance the sensitivity compared to inclusive resonance searches: a simple cut-based selection, a supervised search, and a model-agnostic weakly supervised anomaly search with the CATHODE method. Expected discovery potentials and exclusion limits are shown for 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Unlocking time-dependent $CP$ violation without signal vertexing at $B$ factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to measure, without reconstructing the signal decay vertex, time-dependent $CP$ violation in $B^0$ mesons produced in energy-asymmetric electron-positron collisions near the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance. The method relies on quantum-entangled $B^0\overline{B}^0$ pair-production making the decay time of the partner meson sensitive to $CP$ violation of the signal. We derive analytical expressions for the relevant time-evolution and study, as a use case, an application to $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ decays using simplified simulated experiments that approximate the experimental conditions of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. Our approach yields unbiased estimates of the $CP$-violating coefficients and achieves a sensitivity on mixing-induced $CP$ violation that would require 20-times larger samples with standard approaches. When incorporated into the $B \to \pi\pi$ isospin analysis, the expected results would reduce the degeneracy of $\phi_2$ solutions and significantly increase precision. This method opens a path to previously inaccessible $CP$-violation studies enhancing and accelerating the reach of Belle II and future flavor physics programs.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric muon-antimuon emission from $Z^0$ decays: a clear magnetometer in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a very clear signal of the presence of a strong magnetic field during the early stage of a high-energy heavy-ion collision is provided by the decay of the Z^0 into dimuon pairs. We find that the process is highly anisotropic, producing pairs mainly out of plane, as signaled by a negative value of v_2, and leads to a harder antimuon transverse momentum spectrum, compared with that of the muon transverse momentum spectrum. We also show that the process does not produce a significant distortion of the Z^0 spectral function. The signal can be identified by comparing the dimuon-invariant mass and the individual muon and antimuon spectra produced in semicentral heavy-ion collisions with the corresponding scaled spectra produced in p+p collisions at the $Z^0$ peak.</description>

      <title>Dihadron Angular Correlations in the $e^+e^-$ Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of fixed-order calculations on the dihadron production in electron-positron annihilation is paramount for probing QCD factorization and constraining non-perturbative inputs. This paper investigates the QCD corrections to the angular separation distribution $\theta_{12}$ between two observed hadrons, $H_1$ and $H_2$, in the process $e^+e^- \to H_1 H_2 + X$ up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, with particular emphasis on the intermediate region $\theta_{12} \in (0,\pi)$. The partonic processes at this accuracy consist of two sorts of contributions, the real-virtual and double-real corrections. Of them, the evaluation of four-body phase space integrals in the latter case is at the core of this study. To address them, we first employ the integration-by-parts (IBP) identities to reduce the number of independent integrals and then apply the differential equations (DE) method to recursively solve the resulting master integrals. In kinematic regions where the invariant mass of the unresolved partons vanishes, IBP coefficients can develop divergences. To this end, we resum higher-order terms in the dimensional regulator for each master integral based on the asymptotic behavior of the canonical DEs. After combining the real and virtual corrections with the counter terms from fragmentation function renormalization, we demonstrate that the pole terms in the final analytic expressions exactly cancel out in all partonic channels, thereby providing a non-trivial validation of collinear factorization at the next-to-leading order (NLO). Eventually, when presenting our analytic expressions of the finite partonic coefficients, we transform the transcendental functions resulting from the DE solutions into classical (poly)logarithmic functions, in order to facilitate the implementation in event generators.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in supersymmetric SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the charged and neutral fermion masses and mixings in a supersymmetric SO(10) model with a minimal Higgs sector consisting of the multiplets $10_H$, $45_H$, and $16_H + \overline{16}_H$. In addition to the renormalizable Yukawa couplings involving the Higgs 10-plet, we include non-renormalizable Yukawa couplings, which are important for reproducing with good accuracy the observed masses and mixings in the quark and lepton sectors. We identify a preferred solution which is compatible with third family quasi-Yukawa unification, namely $y_t \approx y_b \approx 0.73 y_{\tau}$ at the unification scale, with the MSSM parameter $\tan\beta \sim 58$. Acceptable solutions with lower $\tan\beta$ values are also realized in our framework, and we provide an example with $\tan \beta =10$. Based on our fits, the masses for the three right-handed neutrinos turn out to be $\left(M_1,M_2,M_3\right)\sim \left(10^9, 8\cdot 10^{12}, 9\cdot 10^{12}\right) \mathrm{GeV}$. We briefly discuss the metastable and quasistable string scenarios that can be realized in this class of supersymmetric SO(10) models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of the effect of density perturbations to the well known thermal dark matter freeze-out scenario. We find $\sim 10 \, \%$ enhancements in the cross section are required to match onto the observed relic abundance for primordial curvature perturbations $\sim 0.2$ at length scales $\sim 1/$Hubble at freeze-out. Such corrections may be of importance in scenarios in which such perturbations are present and observational signals, such as the indirect detection rate, depend sensitively on the DM mass and freeze-out cross section, e.g. near resonances associated with DM bound states.</description>

      <title>Extremal Magic States from Symmetric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic, a key quantum resource beyond entanglement, remains poorly understood in terms of its structure and classification. In this paper, we demonstrate a striking connection between high-dimensional symmetric lattices and quantum magic states. By mapping vectors from the $E_8$, $BW_{16}$, and $E_6$ lattices into Hilbert space, we construct and classify stabiliser and maximal magic states for two-qubit, three-qubit and one-qutrit systems. In particular, this geometric approach allows us to construct, for the first time, closed-form expressions for the maximal magic states in the three-qubit and one-qutrit systems, and to conjecture their total counts. In the three-qubit case, we further classify the extremal magic states according to their entanglement structure. We also examine the distinctive behaviour of one-qutrit maximal magic states with respect to Clifford orbits. Our findings suggest that deep algebraic and geometric symmetries underlie the structure of extremal magic states.</description>

      <title>InflationEasy: A C++ Lattice Code for Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for cosmological inflation. It simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field on a three-dimensional lattice in an expanding FLRW universe, using finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary dynamics beyond the reach of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Origin of the QCD Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity can give rise to (pseudo)scalar fields, for instance due to torsion. In particular, axions of gravitational origin have been proposed as a minimal and compelling solution to the strong CP problem. In this work, we critically examine the feasibility of this approach. We demonstrate that models in which the scalar field couples to fermionic currents only through derivatives do not yield a satisfactory axion. Moreover, we identify the necessary conditions for generating a gravitational axion through quantum effects, highlighting Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity as a promising theoretical setting.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the gravitational force can be obtained by gauging the Lorentz group, which puts gravity on the same footing as the Standard Model fields. The resulting theory - Einstein-Cartan gravity - has several crucial advantages.

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

      <title>The future muon collider for the research of the anomalous neutral quartic $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma\gamma$, and $ZZZ\gamma$ couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the post-LHC era, the muon collider represents a frontier project capable of providing high-energy and high-luminosity leptonic collisions among future lepton-lepton particle accelerators. In addition, it provides significantly cleaner final states than those produced in hadron collisions. With this expectation in mind, in this article, we research the sensitivity of the anomalous neutral gauge boson couplings $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma \gamma$, and $ZZZ\gamma$ defined by dimension-8 operators, through the $\mu^+\mu^- \to \mu^+\mu^-Z\gamma$ signal, with the $Z$-boson decaying to a neutrino pair. The projections at the future muon collider with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV, integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=10$ $\rm ab^{-1}$, and systematic uncertainties of $\delta_{sys}=0\%, 3\%, 5\%$, give an expected sensitivity on the anomalous $f_ {T,j}/\Lambda^4$ couplings at $95\%$ confidence level of the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-3}- 10^{-1})$ $\rm TeV^{-4}$. Compared with the research of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings, we find that the high-luminosity future muon collider could have better sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at the LHC: theory predictions and new-physics reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions for observables in inclusive $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ suitable for measurements at hadron colliders through a sum-over-exclusive approach. At low $q^2$ we calculate the branching ratio and three angular observables. At high $q^2$ we provide the branching ratio and the ratio of the $\bar B \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ rate with respect to the inclusive $\bar B \to X_u \ell \bar\nu$ rate with the same phase-space cut. We compare our predictions to the $B$ factory measurements and also to an extraction of the experimental rate through a sum-over-exclusive method using branching ratios of the exclusive $\bar B \to K^{(*)}\mu^+\mu^-$ modes measured at LHCb. We find a consistent picture comparing Standard Model theory and experiment. As such, our analysis does not support a recent claim about a deficit in the inclusive branching ratio in the high-$q^2$ region. Finally, we present current model-independent bounds on new physics and emphasize the potential of complementary analyses of $\bar{B}\to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at Belle II and the LHC.</description>

      <title>Extra-Dimensional Axion Expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions arising as modes of higher-dimensional gauge fields are known to offer a compelling solution to the axion quality problem and to naturally arise in string theory. In this context, it is interesting to ask how we would interpret an experimental measurement of the axion decay constant $f$. I give several arguments for, as well as concrete examples in string theory of, the existence in such a model of an axion string with tension of order $2\pi S_\mathrm{inst} f^2$, where $S_\mathrm{inst}$ is the instanton action. Furthermore, in models of this type axion strings are typically fundamental objects (rather than solitons), whose tension is at or above the fundamental cutoff of the theory. As a result, I argue that for an extra-dimensional QCD axion, it is likely that the fundamental cutoff scale lies at most two orders of magnitude above $f$. In addition to these core arguments, this paper begins with a self-contained introduction to the physics of extra-dimensional axions and ends with some comments on axion physics in relation to chiral fermions.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-violating Higgs-gauge Boson Couplings at Future Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of future muon colliders to CP-violating interactions in the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the process $\mu^- \mu^+ \to h \bar{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l} \to b\bar{b} \bar{\nu_{l}}\nu_{l}$. Using a model-independent approach within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the contribution of dimension-six operators to Higgs-gauge boson couplings, emphasizing CP-violating effects. To simulate the process, all signal and background events are generated through MadGraph. The analysis provides 95\% confidence level limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$, with a comparative discussion of existing experimental and phenomenological constraints. Our best constraints on the $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$ with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are $[-0.017428;0.018991]$, $[-0.002880;0.002586]$ and $[-0.010784;0.011381]$, respectively. In this context, this study highlights the capability of future muon collider experiments to probe new physics in the Higgs sector, potentially offering tighter constraints on CP-violating Higgs-gauge boson interactions than those provided by current colliders.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02\,$keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98\,$keV at 95% CL. For the general thermal relic fermion dark matter mass the limits translate into $m&gt;0.28\,$keV and $m&gt;0.49\,$keV, respectively. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54\,$keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71\,$keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Flavon in the diphoton channel at future super hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of a CP-even flavon $H_F$ in proton-proton collisions and the prospects for its detection via the diphoton channel at future super hadron colliders, i.e., $pp\to H_F\to\gamma\gamma$. The theoretical framework adopted is a model that invokes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an Abelian flavor symmetry, which includes a Higgs doublet and a complex singlet. We confront the free parameters of the model against theoretical and experimental constraints to find the allowed parameter space, which is then used to evaluate the production cross section of the flavon and the branching ratio of its decay into two photons. We find promising results based on specific benchmark points, achieving signal significances at the level of 5$\sigma$ for flavon masses in the interval $200\lesssim M_{H_F}\lesssim 450$ and integrated luminosities in the range $5-12$ ab$^{-1}$ at the future High-Energy LHC. On the other hand, the Future hadron-hadron Circular Collider could probe masses up to 1 TeV if it reaches an integrated luminosity of at least 2 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel method to experimentally access the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the charged pion $\pi^+$ through the Sullivan process in electron-proton scattering. We demonstrate that the cross sections of $J/\psi$-photoproduction and $\phi$-electroproduction near the respective thresholds are dominated by the gluon GFF of the pion to next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. We predict cross sections for the Electron-Ion Collider and the Jefferson Lab experiments.</description>

      <title>The ABC of RPV II: Classification of R-parity Violating Signatures from UDD Couplings and their Coverage at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the current phenomenological status of baryon number violating operators within the framework of the $R$-parity violating Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (RPV-MSSM). This study aims to identify any gaps in the experimental coverage of the RPV landscape. We identify the unique final states for all possible LSPs decaying via four different benchmark UDD operators. Both the direct production of the LSP and its production via gauge-cascades are considered. For each LSP, we assume that only one UDD coupling is non-zero at a time and confront the signals with existing ATLAS and CMS searches implemented in the recasting framework \texttt{CheckMATE\;2}. We find that the UDD colored LSP sector is well covered with the mass bounds on the gluino LSP being the strongest, and with possible improvements for some of the right-handed squark LSPs. We also point out that there is limited coverage for electroweakino and slepton LSPs with UDD decays. This limitation may be due to the lack of targeted experimental searches for these specific final states or the appropriate recasting of existing searches.</description>

      <title>Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ detection at the DUNE far detector on the experiment's sensitivity to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation. We show that the strongest observable NSI effect in the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance probabilities arises from $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We have studied the hierarchy sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and octant sensitivity of DUNE from $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance channels in presence of NSI. We have also studied the detection sensitivity of NSI phases and the future constaints on NSI parameters from the tau neutrino appearance channels in DUNE. Additionally, we examine the role of $\nu_\tau$ detection in constraining the unitary nature of the PMNS matrix. These studies emphasize the importance of incorporating $\nu_\tau$ detection in long-baseline neutrino experiments such as DUNE.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of near-conformal dynamics and light dilaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analysis of the region slightly outside the conformal window of a non-trivial infrared fixed point in a generic bottom-up holographic setup. We focus on models, which study the dynamics of a scalar field, dual to quark degrees of freedom, in a (nearly) AdS geometry. Such models realize the picture expected for vector-like near-conformal theories from Dyson-Schwinger analysis. The analysis covers a toy model, which allows for analytic solutions, and a more general setup as well, which encompass a complete model for the ultraviolet physics. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of a parametrically light scalar state in the spectrum, which can act as a candidate for the Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from breaking of the approximate conformal symmetry. We also present detailed results for the vacuum structure, correlators, and Ward identities in the near-conformal regime.</description>

      <title>Double neutral-current corrections to NLO electroweak leptonic cross sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for improving next-to-leading order electroweak (EW) predictions for lepton-scattering processes by consistently including double neutral-current corrections arising from vector-boson-fusion topologies, which are formally of higher order. By combining, in a process-independent manner, exact fixed-order results, collinear resummation of QED radiation, and a subtraction procedure, we obtain results which are gauge invariant and valid in the entire phase space, retain any dependence on the masses of electroweak bosons, and can be systematically improved, while avoiding the need for complete next-to-next-to-leading order calculations. This paper is devoted to the development and validation of the formalism; phenomenological applications are presented in a companion study, where we also discuss and motivate why our approach is superior to the one based on EW parton distribution functions for targeting percent-level precision at multi-TeV lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future lepton colliders, such as those based on linear $e^+e^-$ or circular $\mu^+\mu^-$ accelerators, are expected to attain centre-of-mass energies in the multi-TeV range. In this regime the impact of QED and of weak radiation, in both the initial and the final state, can become a leading effect. By employing a general framework presented in a companion paper - suitable for any flavour of colliding leptons - we improve next-to-leading order electroweak predictions by including higher-order contributions, which encompass, but are not limited to, vector-boson-fusion processes. We apply this approach to the study of $t\bar{t}$ and $W^+W^-$ production at a muon collider operating at centre-of-mass energies up to 10 TeV. We show that such an approach, where both QED and weak contributions are included at fixed order, in addition to the all-order resummation of initial-state QED effects, can provide predictions for arbitrary observables in all of the phase space which are precise at the percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results for $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions in general scalar fermion theories are presented to three loops. Various constraints on the individual coefficients for each diagram following from supersymmetry are analysed. The results are used to discuss potential fixed points in the $\varepsilon$-expansion for scalar fermion theories, with arbitrary numbers of scalar fields, and where there are just two scalar couplings and one Yukawa coupling. For different examples the fixed points follow a similar pattern as the numbers of fermions is varied. For diagrams with subdivergences there are extensive consistency constraints arising from the existence of a perturbative $a$-function and these are analysed in detail. Further arbitrary scheme variations which preserve the form of $\beta$ functions and anomalous dimensions in terms of 1PI diagrams are also discussed. The existence of linear and quadratic scheme invariants is demonstrated and the consistency condition are shown to be expressible in terms of these invariants.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. The recent DESI data, which indicate that dark energy may be dynamical, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we evaluate the performance of a data-driven background estimate method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A realistic background spectrum from a search conducted by CMS is considered, where a large sub-region below the trigger threshold is included. It is found that the $L_2$ regularisation can serve as a set of hyperparameters and control the overall modelling performance to satisfy common standards established by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, we show the robustness of this method against increasing luminosity via pseudo-experiments matching the expected luminosity at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). While traditional methods relying on empirical functions have been challenged during LHC Run 2 already, a GPR-based technique can offer a solution that is valid through the entire lifetime of the (HL)-LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field, a quantum field framework for spin-1/2 fermions that exhibit a Wigner doublet -- a discrete quantum number arising from nontrivial representations of the extended Poincar\'{e} group. In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM.</description>
