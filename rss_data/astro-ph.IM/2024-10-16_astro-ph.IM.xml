      <title>How accurate are transient spectral classification tools? -- A study using 4,646 SEDMachine spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of transients obtained from spectroscopic data are important to understand their nature and discover new classes of astronomical objects. For supernovae (SNe), SNID, NGSF (a Python version of SuperFit), and DASH are widely used in the community. Each tool provides its own metric to help determine classification, such as rlap of SNID, chi2/dof of NGSF, and Probability of DASH. However, we do not know how accurate these tools are, and they have not been tested with a large homogeneous dataset. Thus, in this work, we study the accuracy of these spectral classification tools using 4,646 SEDMachine spectra, which have accurate classifications obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Comparing our classifications with those from BTS, we have tested the classification accuracy in various ways. We find that NGSF has the best performance (overall Accuracy 87.6% when samples are split into SNe Ia and Non-Ia types), while SNID and DASH have similar performance with overall Accuracy of 79.3% and 76.2%, respectively. Specifically for SNe Ia, SNID can accurately classify them when rlap &gt; 15 without contamination from other types, such as Ibc, II, SLSN, and other objects that are not SNe (Purity &gt; 98%). For other types, determining their classification is often uncertain. We conclude that it is difficult to obtain an accurate classification from these tools alone. This results in additional human visual inspection effort being required in order to confirm the classification. To reduce this human visual inspection and to support the classification process for future large-scale surveys, this work provides supporting information, such as the accuracy of each tool as a function of its metric.</description>

      <title>Analysis of biasing from noise from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: implications for weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, set to launch in 2026, will bring unprecedented precision to measurements of weak gravitational lensing. Because weak lensing is an inherently small signal, it is imperative to minimize systematic errors in measurements as completely as possible; this will ensure that the lensing measurements can be used to their full potential when extracting cosmological information. In this paper, we use laboratory tests of the Roman detectors, simulations of the Roman High Latitude Survey observations, and the proposed Roman image combination pipeline to investigate the magnitude of detector read noise biasing on weak lensing measurements from Roman. First, we combine lab-measured detector noise fields with simulated observations and propagate these images through the Roman image combination pipeline, IMCOM. We characterize the specific signatures of the noise fields in the resultant images and find that noise contributes to the combined images most strongly at scales relevant to physical characteristics of the detector including PSF shape, chip boundaries, and roll angles. We then measure shapes of simulated stars and galaxies and determine the magnitude of noise-induced shear bias on these measurements. We find that star shape correlations satisfy the system noise requirements as defined by the Roman Science Requirements Document. However, for galaxies fainter than $m_{\rm AB}\simeq24$, correction for noise correlations will be needed in order to ensure confidence in shape measurements in any observation band.</description>

      <title>"My Earth" Astrophysics and Planets -- a serious game to build low carbon scenarios in the astronomy academic community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes what has happened in the mini-workshops entitled ''My Earth in 180 minutes'' organized during the lunch break at the SF2A 2024 conference in Marseille. The project showcased an innovative serious game designed to raise awareness of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in astronomical research laboratories. Participants, organized into teams, simulate strategies to reduce their carbon footprints by 50\%, focusing on key astronomical activities such as space instrumentation, data analysis, and laboratory work. The sessions highlight the challenges of achieving significant emissions reductions without disrupting core research activities, such as telescope observations. While the serious game facilitates important discussions on sustainable practices, the results point to the need for broader engagement, adaptation to different cultural contexts, and institutional support. The project highlights the importance of integrating climate action into the academic environment and suggests potential future directions for expanding its impact.</description>

      <title>The Radio Fundamental Catalogue. I. Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the all-sky catalogue of absolute positions and estimates of correlated flux density of 21,942 compact radio sources determined from processing interferometric visibility data of virtually all VLBI observing sessions at 2 to 23 GHz from 72 programs suitable for absolute astrometry collected for 30 years. We used a novel technique of generation of a dataset of fused observables that allowed us to incorporate all available data in our analysis. The catalogue is the most complete and most precise to date. It forms the foundation and reference for positional astronomy, space geodesy, space navigation, population analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and provides calibrators for phase-referencing for differential astrometry and VLBI astrophysical observations. Its accuracy was evaluated through a detailed accounting systematic errors, rigorous decimation tests, comparison of different datasets, and comparison with other catalogues. The catalogue samples preferentially the AGNs with a strong contemporary parsec-scale synchrotron emission. Its milliarcsecond level positional accuracy allows association of these AGNs with detections in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio to gamma-rays and high energy neutrinos. We describe the innovative data processing and calibration technique in full detail, report the in depth analysis of random and systematic positional errors, and provide the list of associations with large surveys at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>AI Foundation Model for Heliophysics: Applications, Design, and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have been widely researched in the areas of language and vision, demonstrating their capacity to understand long sequences of data and their usefulness in numerous helio-physics applications. Foundation models (FMs), which are pre-trained on a large-scale datasets, form the basis for a variety of downstream tasks. These models, especially those based on transformers in vision and language, show exceptional potential for adapting to a wide range of downstream applications. In this paper, we provide our perspective on the criteria for designing an FM for heliophysics and associated challenges and applications using the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) dataset. We believe that this is the first study to design an FM in the domain of heliophysics.</description>

      <title>Emulators for stellar profiles in binary population modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By delivering more information about the evolution of stellar internal structure, these emulators will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity with large-scale simulations of binary star population synthesis possible with POSYDON and other population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator for the 21-cm power spectrum from MWA drift scan observations II: The Missing Frequency Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing frequency channels pose a problem for estimating $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum (PS) from radio-interferometric visibility data. This is particularly severe for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which has a periodic pattern of missing channels that introduce spikes along $k_\parallel$. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) overcomes this by first correlating the visibilities in the frequency domain to estimate the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ that has no missing frequency separation $\Delta\nu$. We perform a Fourier transform along $\Delta\nu$ to estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$. Considering our earlier work, simulations demonstrate that the TTGE can estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ without any artifacts due to the missing channels. However, the spikes were still found to persist for the actual data, which is foreground-dominated. The current work presents a detailed investigation considering both simulations and actual data. We find that the spikes arise due to a combination of the missing channels and the strong spectral dependence of the foregrounds. Based on this, we propose and demonstrate a technique to mitigate the spikes. Applying this, we find the values of $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ in the region $0.004 \leq k_\perp \leq 0.048\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_\parallel &gt; 0.35 \,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ to be consistent with zero within the expected statistical fluctuations. We obtain the $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta_{\rm UL}^2(k)=(918.17)^2\,{\rm mK^2}$ at $k=0.404\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for the mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations of the $z=8.2$ epoch of reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. This upper limit is from just $\sim 17$ minutes of observation for a single pointing direction. We expect tighter constraints when we combine all $162$ different pointing directions of the drift scan observation.</description>

      <title>Planetary Mass Determinations from a Simplified Photodynamical Model -- Application To The Complete Kepler Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use PyDynamicaLC, a model using the least number of, and the least correlated, degrees of freedom needed to derive a photodynamical model, to describe some of the smallest -- and lowest TTV (transit timing variations) amplitude -- of the Kepler planets. We successfully analyze 64 systems containing 218 planets, for 88 of which we were able to determine significant masses (to better than $3\sigma$). We demonstrate consistency with literature results over two orders of magnitude in mass, and for the planets that already had literature mass estimations, we were able to reduce the relative mass error by $\sim22\%$ (median value). Of the planets with determined masses 23 are new mass determinations with no previous significant literature value, including a planet smaller and lighter than Earth (KOI-1977.02 / Kepler-345 b). These results demonstrate the power of photodynamical modeling with the appropriately chosen degrees of freedom. This will become increasingly more important as smaller planets are detected, especially as the TESS mission gathers ever longer-baseline light curves and for the analysis of the future PLATO mission data</description>

      <title>Simulating images of radio galaxies with diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data are required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implemented a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with full control over the flux and source morphology. We used a diffusion model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models were trained on two different datasets, respectively. One set was a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other, smaller set was obtained from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). In that set, every image was provided with a morphological class label the corresponding model was conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluated the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. The class conditioning was evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on both real and generated data. We were able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. The generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data and the distributions of different image metrics were replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating strong sampling control over morphological properties.</description>

      <title>Extract non-Gaussian Features in Gravitational Wave Observation Data Using Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning model to denoise gravitational wave (GW) signals in the time series strain data without relying on waveform information. Denoising GW data is a crucial intermediate process for machine-learning-based data analysis techniques, as it can simplify the model for downstream tasks such as detections and parameter estimations. We use the blind-spot neural network and train it with whitened strain data with GW signals injected as both input data and target. Under the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, our model successfully denoises 38% of GW signals from binary black hole mergers in H1 data and 49% of signals in L1 data detected in the O1, O2, and O3 observation runs with an overlap greater than 0.5. We also test the model's potential to extract glitch features, loud inspiral compact binary coalescence signals a few seconds before the merger, and unseen CCSN signals during training.</description>
