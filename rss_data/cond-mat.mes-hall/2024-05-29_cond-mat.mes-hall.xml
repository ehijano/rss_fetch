      <title>Resistance Distribution of Decoherent Quantum Hall-Superconductor Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission, of a decoherent quantum Hall-superconductor edge, with the decoherence coming from metallic puddles along the edge. Such metallic puddles may originate from magnetic vortex cores or other superconductivity suppressing perturbations. In contrast to the distribution of a coherent edge which is peaked away from zero charge transmission, we show analytically and numerically that the distribution of a decoherent edge with metallic puddles is always peaked at zero charge transmission, which serves as a probe of coherence of superconducting chiral edge states. We further show that the distribution width decays exponentially in magnetic field and temperature. Our theoretical decoherent distribution agrees well with the recent experimental observation in graphene with superconducting proximity.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional hydrodynamic viscous electron flow in annular Corbino rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of fluidic viscosity is ubiquitous in our everyday life and for it to arise the fluidic medium must necessarily form a continuum where macroscopic properties can emerge. While a powerful concept for tangible liquids, hydrodynamic manifestation of collective flow in electronic systems such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) has only been shown recently to occur in graphene and GaAs/AlGaAs. Here, we present nonlocal electronic transport measurements in concentric annular rings formed in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs and the resulting data strongly suggest that viscous hydrodynamic flow can occur far away from the source-drain current region. Our conclusion of viscous electronic transport is further corroborated by simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations that are found to be in agreement with our measurements below 1K temperature. Most importantly, our work emphasizes the key role played by viscosity via electron-electron (e-e) interaction when hydrodynamic transport is restricted radially, and for which a priori should not have played a major role.</description>

      <title>Charge transport through the multiple end zigzag edge states of armchair graphene nanoribbons and heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive study investigates charge transport through the multiple end zigzag edge states of finite-size armchair graphene nanoribbons/boron nitride nanoribbons (n-AGNR/w-BNNR) junctions under a longitudinal electric field, where n and w denote the widths of the AGNRs and the BNNRs, respectively. In 13-atom wide AGNR segments, the edge states exhibit a blue Stark shift in response to the electric field, with only the long decay length zigzag edge states showing significant interaction with the red Stark shift subband states. Charge tunneling through such edge states assisted by the subband states is elucidated in the spectra of the transmission coefficient. In the 13-AGNR/6-BNNR heterojunction, notable influences on the energy levels of the end zigzag edge states of 13-AGNRs induced by BNNR segments are observed. We demonstrate the modulation of these energy levels in resonant tunneling situations, as depicted by bias-dependent transmission coefficient spectra. Intriguing nonthermal broadening of tunneling current shows a significant peak-to-valley ratio. Our findings highlight the promising potential of n-AGNR/w-BNNR heterojunctions with long decay length edge states in the realm of GNR-based single electron transistors at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative photon-magnon coupling in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnon-photon coupling in an open cavity magnonic system, which leads to two different nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative coupling. One type of singularity is the exceptional point, which is just on the exceptional surface in parameter space. The other type of singularity is the bound state in the continuum discovered in the level-attraction-like coupling, which is above the exceptional surface. In experiment, we realized the two different singularities with nonreciprocity and selectivity in an open cavity magnonic system with suitable dissipation rating. Our results can be understood well with the pseudo-Hermitian theory of magnon-polariton system.</description>

      <title>Band geometry induced electro-optic effect and polarization rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field-induced modulation of the optical properties is crucial for amplitude and phase modulators used in photonic devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the band geometry-induced electro-optic effect, specifically focusing on the Fermi surface and disorder-induced contributions. These contributions are crucial for metallic and semimetallic systems and for optical frequencies comparable to or smaller than the scattering rates. We highlight the importance of the quantum metric and metric connection in generating the electro-optic effect in parity-time reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric systems such as CuMnAs. Our findings establish the electro-optic effect as a novel tool to probe band geometric effects and open new avenues to design electrically controlled efficient amplitude and phase modulators for photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent inhomogeneity and non-locality in a graphene field-effect transistor on a near-parallel moire superlattice of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At near-parallel orientation, twisted bilayer of transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit inter-layer charge transfer-driven out-of-plane ferroelectricity that may lead to unique electronic device architectures. Here we report detailed electrical transport in a dual-gated graphene field-effect transistor placed on 3R stacked twisted bilayer of WSe2 at a twist angle of 2.1 degree. We observe hysteretic transfer characteristics and an emergent charge inhomogeneity with multiple local Dirac points as the electric displacement field (D) is increased. Concomitantly, we also observe a strong non-local voltage signal at D = 0 V/nm that decreases rapidly with increasing D. A linear scaling of the non-local signal with longitudinal resistance suggests edge mode transport, which we attribute to the breaking of valley symmetry of the graphene channel due to the spatially fluctuating electric field from the moire domains of the underlying twisted WSe2. A quantitative analysis connecting the non-locality and channel inhomogeneity suggests emergence of finite-size domains in the graphene channel that modulate the charge and the valley currents simultaneously. This work underlines efficient control and impact of interfacial ferroelectricity that can trigger a new genre of devices for twistronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exchange Splitting Mechanism of Negative Magnetoresistance in Layered Antiferromagnetic Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with AFM-type ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$P$_2$, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about $\delta\rho/\rho \sim 4-6\%$ up to the spin-polarization field. Despite the fact that this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. In this paper we propose a novel theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that does not imply either topological origin of the materials, surface roughness, their potential defect structure, or electron-magnon scattering. We believe, the proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is applicable to a wide class of the layered AFM- ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.</description>

      <title>Triple-top-gate technique for studying the strongly-interacting 2D electron systems in heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a technique that dramatically reduces the contact resistances and depletes a shunting channel between the contacts in the ungated area outside the Hall bar in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. It involves the creation of three overlapping independent gates deposited on top of the structure and allows transport measurements to be performed at millikelvin temperatures in the strongly interacting limit at low electron densities, where the energy of the electron-electron interactions dominates all other energy scales. This design allows one to observe the two-threshold voltage-current characteristics that are a signature for the collective depinning and sliding of the electron solid.</description>

      <title>RealTimeTransport: An open-source C++ library for quantum transport simulations in the strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of quantum transport in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge that demands specialized tools for accurate analysis. RealTimeTransport is a new open-source C++ library that enables the computation of both stationary and transient transport observables for generic quantum systems connected to metallic reservoirs. It computes the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernels for both dynamics and transport in real-time going beyond traditional expansions in the bare system-reservoir couplings. Currently, several methods are available: (i) A renormalized perturbation theory in leading and next-to-leading order which avoids the low-temperature breakdown that limits the traditional theory. (ii) Starting from this well-behaved reference solution a 2- and 3-loop self-consistent renormalization-group transformation of the memory kernels is implemented. This allows refined quantitative predictions even in the presence of many body resonances, such as the Kondo enhancement of cotunneling. This paper provides an overview of the theory, the architecture of RealTimeTransport and practical demonstrations of the currently implemented methods. In particular, we analyze the stationary transport through a serial double quantum dot and showcase for the $T=0$ interacting Anderson model the complete time-development of single-electron tunneling (SET), cotunneling-assisted SET (CO-SET) and inelastic cotunneling resonances throughout the entire gate-bias stability diagram. We discuss the range of applicability of the implemented methods and benchmark them against other advanced approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced fractional quantum Hall gaps in a two-dimensional electron gas coupled to a hovering split-ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetotransport of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas coupled to a hovering split-ring resonator with controllable distance is studied in the quantum Hall regime. The measurements reveal an enhancement by more than a factor 2 of the quantum Hall energy gaps at the fractional filling factors 4/3, 5/3, and 7/5, alongside a concurrent reduction in exchange splitting at odd integer filling factors. Theoretically, we show the strength of both effects to be quantitatively compatible with the emergence of an effective electron-electron long-range attractive interaction mediated by the exchange of virtual cavity photons in the presence of significant spatial gradients of the cavity electric vacuum fields. These results unveil a compelling interplay between cavity quantum electrodynamics and electronic correlations in two-dimensional systems, with profound implications for the manipulation and control of quantum phases in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band (FB) to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states (CLS) associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the FB superconductivity in such a system. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Diamond phase in space and possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eventual presence of diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarises principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds extracted from meteorites. Size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects were never observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption, of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds, opens a possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Topology of Multiband Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex eigenenergies and non-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique topological phenomena that cannot appear in Hermitian systems. Representative examples are the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points. In a two-dimensional parameter space, topological classifications of non-separable bands in multiband non-Hermitian systems can be established by invoking a permutation group, where the product of the permutation represents state exchange due to exceptional points in the space. We unveil in this work the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines in non-Hermitian topology for multiple bands. Contrary to current understanding, the non-separability of non-Hermitian multibands can be topologically non-trivial without exceptional points in two-dimensional space. Our work builds on the fundamental and comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian multiband systems and also offers versatile applications and realizations of non-Hermitian systems without the need to consider exceptional points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian systems form a broad area of physics that remains greatly unexplored despite years of intensive investigations. The spotlight is on memory as a source of effects that are absent in their Markovian counterparts. In this work we dive into this problem and analyze a driven Brownian particle moving in a spatially periodic potential and exposed to correlated thermal noise. We show that the absolute negative mobility effect, in which the net movement of the particle is in direction opposite to the average force acting on it, may be induced by the memory of the setup. To explain the origin of this phenomenon we resort to the recently developed effective mass approach to dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>SP-STM study of the multi-Q phases in GdRu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two stable surfaces of GdRu2Si2 are studied using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM). Depending on the applied magnetic field different magnetic phases have been found and the presented measurements are in agreement with the respective previously proposed multi-Q spin textures. In particular the multi-Q nature of the zero magnetic field state, for which previous experiments could not rule out the coexistence of single-Q states, can be confirmed by our spin-resolved measurements on the Si-terminated surface. The surfaces of GdRu2Si2 exhibit strong magnetism-induced modulations of the spin-averaged density of states. We find that while the magnetic contribution to the tunnel signal can be clearly identified for the Si-terminated surface this proves to be much more difficult for the Gd-terminated surface. However, the magnetic field dependent spatial modulations on the Gd-terminated surface demonstrate that additional magnetic phase transitions occur for the surface layer compared to those identified for bulk GdRu2Si2 and possible spin textures are presented.</description>

      <title>Error-Free and Current-Driven Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Domain Wall Memory Enabled by Channel Meandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new type of multi-bit and energy-efficient magnetic memory based on current-driven, field-free, and highly controlled domain wall motion. A meandering domain wall channel with precisely interspersed pinning regions provides the multi-bit capability of a magnetic tunnel junction. The magnetic free layer of the memory device has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, so that spin-orbit torques induce efficient domain wall motion. Using micromagnetic simulations, we find two pinning mechanisms that lead to different cell designs: two-way switching and four-way switching. The memory cell design choices and the physics behind these pinning mechanisms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we show that switching reliability and speed may be significantly improved by replacing the ferromagnetic free layer with a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer. Switching behavior and material choices will be discussed for the two implementations.</description>

      <title>Switching dynamics in Al/InAs nanowire-based gate-controlled superconducting switch</title>

Abstract: The observation of the gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect in superconducting nanostructures increased the hopes for realizing a superconducting equivalent of semiconductor field-effect transistors. However, recent works attribute this effect to various leakage-based scenarios, giving rise to a debate on its origin. A proper understanding of the microscopic process underlying the GCS effect and the relevant time scales would be beneficial to evaluate the possible applications. In this work, we observed gate-induced two-level fluctuations between the superconducting state and normal state in Al/InAs nanowires (NWs). Noise correlation measurements show a strong correlation with leakage current fluctuations. The time-domain measurements show that these fluctuations have Poissonian statistics. Our detailed analysis of the leakage current measurements reveals that it is consistent with the stress-induced leakage current (SILC), in which inelastic tunneling with phonon generation is the predominant transport mechanism. Our findings shed light on the microscopic origin of the GCS effect and give deeper insight into the switching dynamics of the superconducting NW under the influence of the strong gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Controlling the orbital Hall effect in gapped bilayer graphene in the terahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in the AC regime using bilayer graphene (BLG) as a prototypical material platform. While the unbiased BLG has gapless electronic spectra, applying a perpendicular electric field creates an energy band gap that can be continuously tuned from zero to high values. By exploiting this flexibility, we demonstrate the ability to control the behavior of AC orbital Hall conductivity. Particularly, we demonstrate that the orbital Hall conductivity at the neutrality point changes its signal at a critical frequency, the value of which is proportional to the perpendicular electric field. For BLG with narrow band gaps, the active frequency region for the AC OHE may extend to a few terahertz, which is experimentally accessible with current technologies. We also consider the introduction of a perpendicular magnetic field in the weak coupling regime using first-order perturbation theory to illustrate how the breaking of time-reversal symmetry enables the emergence of AC charge Hall effect in the charge-doped situation and modifies the AC orbital Hall conductivity. Our calculations suggest that BLG with narrow bandgaps is a practical candidate for investigating time-dependent orbital angular momentum transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium orbital edge magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncompensated non-equilibrium orbital magnetization may arise at sample edges in the presence of charge current. The value of the effect scales as the product of the current density and the electron mean free path without any additional smallness. This non-relativistic phenomenon originates in a lack of inversion symmetry of the electron wave functions in a vicinity of sample interfaces. In a conducting layer, where $z$ direction is chosen perpendicular to the surface, and the current flows in $x$ direction, the non-equilibrium orbital magnetization points in $y$ direction. In a top-bottom symmetric layer, the orbital magnetization has an opposite sign near the top and bottom interfaces thus mimicking the symmetry of the spin-Hall effect but can exceed the latter by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Heat-based circuits using quantum rectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increased power consumption of modern computer components, heat-based circuitry has become ever more relevant due to a lower power expense to process logic bits of information. In heat-based circuits, computations are performed by driving heat currents through a circuit using a temperature difference. Utilizing harmonic oscillators and three-level quantum rectifiers as base components, we study three different heat-based circuits: a series configuration of diodes, a parallel configuration of diodes, and a diode bridge rectifier. We demonstrate the required functionality of each circuit for use as heat-based analogues of standard electronic components. Furthermore, the diode bridge rectifier is found to give consistent sign of the output bias independent of the input bias thus rectifying the input. Our results prove the theoretical feasibility of combining heat current components into heat-based circuits. The three circuits should be realizable using several of the current quantum technology platforms.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Quantum Geometry and the Strength of Electron-Phonon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling of electrons to phonons (electron-phonon coupling) is crucial for the existence of various phases of matter, in particular superconductivity and density waves. Here, we devise a theory that incorporates the quantum geometry of the electron bands into the electron-phonon coupling, demonstrating the crucial contributions of the Fubini-Study metric or its orbital selective version to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant. We apply the theory to two materials, graphene and MgB$_2$ where the geometric contributions account for approximately 50\% and 90\% of the total electron-phonon coupling constant, respectively. The quantum geometric contributions in the two systems are further bounded from below by topological contributions. Our results suggest that the nontrivial electron band geometry/topology might favor superconductivity with relatively high critical temperature.</description>

      <title>First-principles studies of fermiology in topological phases of bulk ZrTe$_5$</title>

Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Among these materials, three-dimensional (3D) zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_5$) stands out as one of the most intriguing for both theoretical and experimental studies because of its diverse range of distinct topological phases. In this work, we employ density functional theory to study the electronic structure and quantum oscillations exhibited by various topological phases of 3D bulk ZrTe$_5$. We have discovered that by analyzing combined patterns in band structures, Fermi surfaces, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations we can determine the corresponding topological phase without relying on the conventional calculation of topological invariants or boundary state contributions. This approach facilitates the identification of topological phases in ZrTe$_5$ directly from experimental quantum oscillation measurements. Using this method, we have analyzed the entire process of topological phase transition, revealing changes in the topology of the Fermi pockets and validating the shapes deduced from the experimental data for the topological phases.</description>
