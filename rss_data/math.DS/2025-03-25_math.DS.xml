      <title>Tensor-based homogeneous polynomial dynamical system analysis from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous complex real-world systems, such as those in biological, ecological, and social networks, exhibit higher-order interactions that are often modeled using polynomial dynamical systems or homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs). However, identifying system parameters and analyzing key system-theoretic properties remain challenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity, particularly for large-scale systems. To address these challenges, we develop an innovative computational framework in this article that leverages advanced tensor decomposition techniques, namely tensor train and hierarchical Tucker decompositions, to facilitate efficient identification and analysis of HPDSs that can be equivalently represented by tensors. Specifically, we introduce memory-efficient system identification techniques for directly estimating system parameters represented through tensor decompositions from time-series data. Additionally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for determining controllability and observability using the tensor decomposition-based representations of HPDSs, accompanied by detailed complexity analyses that demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pitchfork bifurcations and symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified framework is proposed to quantitatively characterize pitchfork bifurcations and associated symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). It is known that planar/vertical Lyapunov orbits and Lissajous orbits near the collinear libration points undergo pitchfork bifurcations with varying orbital energy. These bifurcations induce symmetry breaking, generating bifurcated families including halo/quasi-halo orbits, axial/quasi-axial orbits, and their corresponding invariant manifolds. Traditional semi-analytical methods for constructing halo orbits, based on resonant bifurcation mechanisms, have obstacles in fully exploiting the intrinsic symmetry breaking characteristics in pitchfork bifurcations. In this paper, we propose a unified trigonometric series-based framework to analyze these bifurcated families from the perspective of coupling-induced bifurcation mechanisms. By introducing a coupling coefficient and various bifurcation equations into the ERTBP, different symmetry breaking is achieved when the coupling coefficient is non-zero. This unified semi-analytical framework captures bifurcations of both periodic/quasi-periodic and transit/non-transit orbits. Furthermore, it reveals that pitchfork bifurcation solutions in the ERTBP fundamentally depend solely on the orbital eccentricity and three amplitude parameters of the system's degrees of freedom, governing both the elliptic direction and the hyperbolic one.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Optimal Projection onto Slow Spectral Manifolds for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the dynamically optimal projection onto the linear slow manifold from a temporal variational principle. We demonstrate that the projection captures transient dynamics of the overall dissipative system and leads to a considerably improved fit of reduced trajectories compared to full trajectories. We illustrate these optimal model reduction properties on explicit examples, including the linear three-component Grad's moment system.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Optimization for Multi-valued Topological Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of ergodic optimization for multi-valued dynamical systems is developed. A notion of maximum ergodic average is defined, and a number of characterisations are given. It is shown that typically a maximizing measure is unique: in a separable Banach space of continuous functions, the exceptional set of functions with non-unique maximizing measure can be covered by countably many hypersurfaces (this strengthens previous results, even in the case of single-valued dynamical systems). The connection with graph dynamical systems is elaborated, and a theory of open expanding multi-valued dynamical systems is developed, leading to a Ma\~n\'e lemma for such systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium states by synchronization, symbolic extensions, and factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the two classical topological concepts, time-preserving topological factors and synchronizing time-changes of a continuous flow, and explore some of their thermodynamic consequences. Particular focus is put on equilibrium states and, in particular, measures of maximal entropy, with emphasis on geodesic flows on rank-one surfaces of nonpositive curvature and their time-preserving expansive topological factors for which we investigate the scaled geometric potentials.</description>

      <title>Rational maps whose Julia sets are generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the Sierpi\'nski gasket-like sets can appear as the Julia sets of some geometrically finite rational maps. In this paper we prove that such type of Julia sets can also appear in the rational maps containing Siegel disks, Cremer points or which are infinitely renormalizable. Based on this, we prove the existence of gasket Julia sets with positive area. Moreover, we present a criterion which guarantees the existence of gasket Julia sets in some rational maps having exactly one fixed attracting or parabolic basin.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For continuous self-maps of compact metric spaces, we explore the relationship among the shadowable points, sensitive points, and entropy points. Specifically, we show that (1) if the set of shadowable points is dense in the phase space, then a point located in the interior of the set of sensitive points is an entropy point; and (2) if the topological entropy is zero, then the denseness of the set of shadowable points is equivalent to almost chain continuity. In addition, we present a counter-example to a question raised by Ye and Zhang regarding entropy points.</description>

      <title>A degenerate Takens--Bogdanov bifurcation in a normal form of Lorenz's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider an unfolding of a normal form of the Lorenz system near a triple-zero singularity. We are interested in the analysis of double-zero bifurcations emerging from that singularity. Their local study provide partial results that are extended by means of numerical continuation methods. Specifically, a curve of heteroclinic connections is detected. It has a degenerate point from which infinitely many homoclinic connections emerge. In this way, we can partially understand the dynamics near the triple-zero singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the classification of real-analytic vector fields on the two-torus up to orbital topological equivalence does not admit a complete numerical invariant that is a Borel function. Moreover, smooth vector fields that are difficult to classify appear in generic smooth 7-parameter families. In dimension 2, this improves the recent result of Gorodetski and Foreman (arXiv:2206.09322) for non-classifiability of smooth diffeomorphisms up to continuous conjugacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, building on the ideas of Avila--Forni and recent developments on the Kontsevich--Zorich cocycle, we prove that linear involutions are generically weakly mixing. As a consequence, we deduce that for generic half-translation surfaces, the vertical foliation is also weakly mixing.</description>

      <title>Connections between the minimal neighborhood and the activity value of cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a finite set $A$, a cellular automaton is a transformation of the configuration space $A^G$ defined via a finite neighborhood and a local map. Although neighborhoods are not unique, every CA admits a unique minimal neighborhood, which consists on all the essential cells in $G$ that affect the behavior of the local map. An active transition of a cellular automaton is a pattern that produces a change on the current state of a cell when the local map is applied. In this paper, we study the links between the minimal neighborhood and the number of active transitions, known as the activity value, of cellular automata. Our main results state that the activity value usually imposes several restrictions on the size of the minimal neighborhood of local maps.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected synchronization in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations of these), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the inner part of the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes play the role of independent pacemakers.</description>

      <title>Escape of mass of the Thue-Morse sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every Laurent series in $\mathbb{F}_q\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)$ has a continued fraction expansion whose partial quotients are polynomials. De Mathan and Teuli\'e proved that the degrees of the partial quotients of the left-shifts of every quadratic Laurent series are unbounded. Shapira and Paulin and Kemarsky improved this by showing that certain sequences of probability measures on the space of lattices in the plane $\mathbb{F}_q\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)^2$ exhibit positive escape of mass and conjectured that this escape is full -- that is, that these probability measures converge to zero. We disprove this conjecture by analysing in detail the case of the Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_2$ whose sequence of coefficients is the Thue-Morse sequence. The proof relies on the discovery of explicit symmetries in its number wall.</description>

      <title>Benign landscapes for synchronization on spheres via normalized Laplacian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonconvex optimization landscapes of synchronization problems on spheres. First, we present new results for the statistical problem of synchronization over the two-element group $\mathbf{Z}_2$. We consider the nonconvex least-squares problem with $\mathbf{Z}_2 = \{\pm 1\}$ relaxed to the unit sphere in $\mathbf{R}^r$ for $r \geq 2$; for several popular models, including graph clustering under the binary stochastic block model, we show that, for any $r \geq 2$, every second-order critical point recovers the ground truth in the asymptotic regimes where exact recovery is information-theoretically possible. Such statistical optimality via spherical relaxations had previously only been shown for (potentially arbitrarily) larger relaxation dimension $r$. Second, we consider the global synchronization of networks of coupled oscillators under the (homogeneous) Kuramoto model. We prove new and optimal asymptotic results for random signed networks on an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph, and we give new and simple proofs for several existing state-of-the-art results. Our key tool is a deterministic landscape condition that extends a recent result of Rakoto Endor and Waldspurger. This result says that, if a certain problem-dependent Laplacian matrix has small enough condition number, the nonconvex landscape is benign. Our extension allows the condition number to include an arbitrary diagonal preconditioner, which gives tighter results for many problems. We show that, for the synchronization of Kuramoto oscillator networks on nearest-neighbor circulant graphs as studied by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan, this condition is optimal. We also prove a natural complex extension that may be of interest for synchronization on the special orthogonal group $\operatorname{SO}(2)$.</description>

      <title>On two families of iterative methods without memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two natural families of methods of order $n\ge 2$ that are useful for solving numerically one variable equations $f(x)=0.$ The first family consists on the methods that depend on $x,f(x)$ and its successive derivatives up to $f^{(n-1)}(x)$ and the second family comprises methods that depend on $x,g(x)$ until $g^{\circ n}(x),$ where $g^{\circ m}(x)=g(g^{\circ (m-1)}(x))$ and $g(x)=f(x)+x$. The first family includes the well-known Newton, Chebyshev, and Halley methods, while the second one contains the Steffensen method. Although the results for the first type of methods are well known and classical, we provide new, simple, detailed, and self-contained proofs.</description>

Abstract: In the context of continuous zooming systems $f:M \to M$ on a compact metric space $M$, which include the non-uniformly expanding ones, possibly with the presence of a critical set, with the zooming set dense in $M$, we prove that any H\"older potential $\phi : M \to \mathbb{R}$ for which the integrals $\int \phi d\mu \geq 0$ with respect to any $f$-invariant probability $\mu$, admits a continuous function $\lambda_{0} : M \to \mathbb{R}$ (which can be H\"older if some integral is positive) such that
  \[
  \phi \geq \lambda_{0}- \lambda_{0} \circ f.
  \]
  This extends a result in [9] for $C^{1}$-expanding maps on the circle $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ to important classes of maps as uniformly expanding, local diffeomorphisms with non-uniform expansion, Viana maps, Benedicks-Carleson maps and Rovella maps. We also give an example beyond the exponential contractions context.
  Moreover, in the case of the integrals $\int \phi d\mu = 0$ with respect to any $f$-invariant probability $\mu$ and the set of periodic points to be dense in $M$, we obtain a version of the Livsic Theorem, that is, the functions $\lambda_{0}$ can be taken such that
  \[
  \phi = \lambda_{0}- \lambda_{0} \circ f.
  \]
  Additionally, we also prove that the measure which maximizes the integrals is unique for a residual set of potentials.</description>

      <title>Tracking and forecasting oscillatory data streams using Koopman autoencoders and Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.</description>

Abstract: A question of F. Kwakkel and V. Markovic on existence of C^1-diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces that permute a dense collection of domains with bounded geometry is answered in the negative. In fact, it is proved that for closed surfaces of genus at least one such diffeomorphisms do not exist regardless of whether they have positive or zero topological entropy.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of infinite number of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits to two periodic orbits for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE on the line with odd and periodic boundary conditions and for some fixed parameter value of the system.

      <title>Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Hankel DMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a noise-robust learning framework for the Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems, with guaranteed long-term stability and improved model performance for better model-based predictive control tasks. Unlike some existing approaches that rely on ad hoc observables or black-box neural networks in extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our framework leverages observables generated by the system dynamics, when the system dynamics is known, through a Hankel matrix, which shares similarities with discrete Polyflow. When system dynamics is unknown, we approximate them with a neural network while maintaining structural similarities to discrete Polyflow. To enhance noise robustness and ensure long-term stability, we developed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator, along with a progressive learning strategy for rollout loss. To further improve the performance of the model in the phase space, a simple iterative data augmentation strategy was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

      <title>Quantitative uniform exponential acceleration of averages along decaying waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, utilizing a specific exponential weighting function, we investigate the uniform exponential convergence of weighted Birkhoff averages along decaying waves and delve into several related variants. A key distinction from traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in observables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular, we develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential convergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this innovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different weighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in prior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted Birkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential acceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits, particularly from a quantitative perspective.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the impact of fear in the presence of additional food and prey refuge with nonlocal predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many positive and negative factors present in the predator-prey interaction which affect the net growth of the species. Fear of predation is one such factor that creates psychological stress in a prey species, which causes a negative impact on their overall growth. This work considers a predator-prey model where the prey species faces a reduction in their growth out of fear, and the predator has an alternative food source that helps the prey to hide in a safer place. As an extension into the nonlocal spatio-temporal model, a nonlocal term is considered in the prey growth to incorporate a fear-effect range around their spatial location. Linear stability analysis helps to analyze the temporal model and produces a wide range of interesting results, including the presence of a certain amount of fear or even prey refuge, which helps in population coexistence. Furthermore, the numerical simulations of the local and nonlocal spatio-temporal models show different types of spatial-temporal patterns, such as Turing and non-Turing patterns. Nevertheless, an increase in fear level reduces the range of the Turing domain for the local model, whereas the opposite happens when the range of nonlocal interaction is increased.</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Machine Learning-based Control Method for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems with Highly Noisy Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a physics-informed machine learning-based control method for nonlinear dynamic systems with highly noisy measurements. Existing data-driven control methods that use machine learning for system identification cannot effectively cope with highly noisy measurements, resulting in unstable control performance. To address this challenge, the present study extends current physics-informed machine learning capabilities for modeling nonlinear dynamics with control and integrates them into a model predictive control framework. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed method we test and validate with two noisy nonlinear dynamic systems: the chaotic Lorenz 3 system, and turning machine tool. Analysis of the results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks as measured by both modeling accuracy and control performance for nonlinear dynamic systems under high-noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Filters Using Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering - the task of estimating the conditional distribution for states of a dynamical system given partial and noisy observations - is important in many areas of science and engineering, including weather and climate prediction. However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), provide biased probabilistic estimates for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map - the transformation that takes samples from a forecast distribution, and combines with an observation, to update the approximate filtering distribution - using variational inference. In principle this can lead to a better approximation of the filtering distribution, and hence smaller bias. We show that this methodology can be used to learn the gain matrix, in an affine analysis map, for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems; we also study the learning of inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. The framework developed here can also be used to learn new filtering algorithms with more general forms for the analysis map.</description>

      <title>Unilateral vibration transmission in mechanical systems with bilinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Oscillation Estimates Arising in Pointwise Ergodic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove essentially optimal $L^p(\mathbb{R})$-estimates for variational variants of the maximal Fourier multiplier operators considered by Bourgain in his work on pointwise convergence of polynomial ergodic averages. As a corollary of our methods, we are able to quickly extend a result of Bourgain, namely the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages of integer parts of real-variables polynomials, to a broader class of functions, previously considered in a wide range of contexts by Boshernitzan-Jones-Wierdl. Namely, the following averages converge almost everywhere \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor P(n) \rfloor} f, \; \; \; f \in L^p(X,\mu), \ P \in \mathbb{R}[\cdot], \] for any $\sigma$-finite measure space equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T:X \to X$, whenever $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$ if $P$ is linear, and $4/3 &lt; p \leq \infty$ otherwise.</description>
