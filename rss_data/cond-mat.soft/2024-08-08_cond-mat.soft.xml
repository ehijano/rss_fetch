      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of head-on low-velocity collisions between particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle contact model is important for powder simulations. Although several contact models have been proposed, their validity has not yet been well established. Therefore, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to clarify the particle interaction. We simulate head-on collisions of two particles with impact velocities less than a few percent of the sound velocity to investigate the dependence of the interparticle force and the coefficient of restitution (COR) on the impact velocity and particle radius. In this study, we treat particles with a radius of 10-100 nm and perform simulations. We find that the interparticle force exhibits hysteresis between the loading and unloading phases. Larger impact velocities result in strong hysteresis and plastic deformation. For all impact velocities and particle radii, the coefficient of restitution is smaller than that given by the Johnson-Kendall-Robert theory. An inelastic contact model cannot reproduce our MD simulations. In particular, the COR is significantly reduced when the impact velocity exceeds a certain value. This significant energy dissipation cannot be explained even by the contact models including plastic deformation. We also find that the COR increases with increasing particle radius. We also find that the previous contact models including plastic deformation cannot explain the strong energy dissipation obtained in our MD simulations, although they agree with the MD results for very low impact velocities. Accordingly, we have constructed a new dissipative contact model in which the dissipative force increases with the stress generated by collisions. The new stress dependent model successfully reproduces our MD results over a wider range of impact velocities than the conventional models do. In addition, we proposed another, simpler, dissipative contact model that can also reproduce the MD results.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical materials with interconnected pores from capillary suspensions for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for bone grafts due to the aging population has opened new opportunities for the manufacture of porous ceramics to assist in bone reconstruction. In our study, we investigate a new, promising method to manufacture hierarchically porous structures in a straightforward, and tuneable way. It consists of combining the novel technology of capillary suspensions, formed by mixing solid particles and two immiscible liquids, one less than 5 vol%, with freeze casting. We have successfully achieved alumina and $\beta$-TCP materials with both &lt;2 $\mu$m and 20-50 $\mu$m as the smallest and largest pore size, respectively. The microstructure exhibits fully open pores and high levels of porosity (&gt; 60%). The capillary suspensions' rheological behaviour indicates that silica nano-suspensions as a secondary fluid creates a stronger internal particle network than sucrose for the alumina system. Conversely, the opposite was observed with the $\beta$-TCP system. These differences were attributed to the change in affinity between the secondary fluids and the solid loading. In our study, both systems have served to deepen the knowledge about the new area of capillary suspensions and prove their use in hierarchical porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Surface potentials of conductors in electrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we place conducting bodies in electrolyte solutions, their surface potential $\Phi_s$ appears to be much smaller in magnitude than the intrinsic one $\Phi_0$ and normally does not obey the classical electrostatic boundary condition of a constant surface potential expected for conductors. In this paper, we demonstrate that an explanation of these observations can be obtained by postulating that diffuse ions condense at the "wall" due to a reduced permittivity of a solvent.
  For small values of $\Phi_0$ the surface potential responds linearly. On increasing $\Phi_0$ further $\Phi_s$ augments nonlinearly and then saturates to a constant value. Analytical approximations for $\Phi_s$ derived for these three distinct modes show that it always adjusts to salt concentration, which is equivalent to a violation of the constant potential condition. The latter would be appropriate for highly dilute solutions, but only if $\Phi_0$ is small. Surprisingly, when the plateau with high $\Phi_s$ is reached, the conductor surface switches to a constant charge density condition normally expected for insulators. Our results are directly relevant for conducting electrodes, mercury drops, colloidal metallic particles and more.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained models for phase separation in DNA-based fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA is now firmly established as a versatile and robust platform for achieving synthetic nanostructures. While the folding of single molecules into complex structures is routinely achieved through engineering basepair sequences, much less is known about the emergence of structure on larger scales in DNA fluids. The fact that polymeric DNA fluids can undergo phase separation into dense fluid and dilute gas opens avenues to design hierachical and multifarious assemblies. Here we investigate to which extent the phase behavior of single-stranded DNA fluids is captured by a minimal model of semiflexible charged homopolymers while neglecting specific hybridization interactions. We first characterize the single-polymer behavior and then perform direct coexistence simulations to test the model against experimental data. We conclude that counterions not only determine the effective range of direct electrostatic interactions but also the effective attractions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Influence of Solvation on the Electrochemical Double Layer of Salt / Solvent Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling electrolytes accurately on both a nanoscale and cell level can contribute to improving battery chemistries.[Armand and Tarascon, Nature, 2008, 451, 652-657] We previously presented a thermodynamic continuum model for electrolytes.[arXiv:2010.14915] In this paper we include solvation interactions between the ions and solvent, which alter the structure of the electochemical double layer (EDL). We are able to combine a local solvation model -- permitting examination of the interplay between electric forces and the ion-solvent binding -- with a full electrolyte model. Using this, we can investigate double layer structures for a wide range of electrolytes, especially including highly concentrated solutions. We find that some of the parameters of our model significantly affect the solvent concentration at the electrode surface, and thereby the rate of solvent decomposition. Firstly, an increased salt concentration weakens the solvation shells, making it possible to strip the solvent in the EDL before the ions reach the surface. The strength of the ion-solvent interaction also affects at which potential difference the solvation shells removed. We are therefore able to qualitatively predict EDL structures for different electrolytes based on parameters like molecule size, solvent binding energy and salt concentration.</description>

      <title>Generalized Finsler geometry and the anisotropic tearing of skin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuum mechanical theory with foundations in generalized Finsler geometry describes the complex anisotropic behavior of skin. A fiber bundle approach, encompassing total spaces with assigned linear and nonlinear connections, geometrically characterizes evolving configurations of a deformable body with microstructure. An internal state vector is introduced on each configuration, describing subscale physics. A generalized Finsler metric depends on position and the state vector, where the latter dependence allows for both direction (i.e., as in Finsler geometry) as well as magnitude. Equilibrium equations are derived using a variational method, extending concepts of finite-strain hyperelasticity coupled to phase-field mechanics to generalized Finsler space. For application to skin tearing, state vector components represent microscopic damage processes (e.g., fiber rearrangements and ruptures) in different directions with respect to intrinsic orientations (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to Langer's lines). Nonlinear potentials, motivated from soft-tissue mechanics and phase-field fracture theories, are assigned with orthotropic material symmetry pertinent to properties of skin. Governing equations are derived for one- and two-dimensional base manifolds. Analytical solutions capture experimental force-stretch data, toughness, and observations on evolving microstructure, in a more geometrically and physically descriptive way than prior phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Programming bistability in geometrically perturbed mechanical metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials capable of large deformations are an emerging platform for functional devices and structures across scales. Bistable designs are particularly attractive since they endow a single object with two configurations that display distinct shapes, properties and functionalities. We propose a strategy that takes a common (non-bistable) metamaterial design and transforms it into a bistable one, specifically, by allowing for irregular patterns through geometric perturbations of the unit cell and by leveraging the intercell constraints inherent to the large deformation response of metamaterials. We exemplify this strategy by producing a design framework for bistable planar kirigami metamaterials starting from the canonical rotating-squares pattern. The framework comprises explicit design formulas for cell-based kirigami with unprecedented control over the shape of the two stable states, and an optimization methodology that allows for efficient tailoring of the geometric features of the designs to achieve target elastic properties as well as shape change. The versatility of this framework is illustrated through a wide variety of examples, including non-periodic designs that achieve two arbitrarily-shaped stable states. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, featuring prototypes with distinct engineering design details, complement the theory and shine light on the strengths and limitations of our design approach. These results show how to design bistable metamaterials from non-bistable templates, paving the way for further discovery of bistable systems and structures that are not simply arrangements of known bistable units.</description>

      <title>A Simple Tensorial Theory of Smectic C Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The smectic C (smC) phase represents a unique class of liquid crystal phases characterised by the layered arrangement of molecules with tilted orientations with respect to layer normals. Building upon the real-valued tensorial smectic A (smA) model in [Xia et al., PRL, 126, 177801 (2021)], we propose a new continuum mathematical model for smC (and smA) by introducing a novel coupling term between the real tensor containing orientational information and density variation, to control the tilt angle between directors and the layer normal (the tilt angle is zero for smA and nonzero for smC). To validate our proposed model, we conduct a series of two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments that account for typical structures in smectics: chevron patterns, defects, dislocations and toroidal focal conic domains (TFCDs). These results also reveal the phenomenological differences between smA and smC configurations.</description>

      <title>Chirotactic response of microswimmers in fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd viscosity is a property of chiral active fluids with broken time-reversal and parity symmetries. We show that the flow of such a fluid around a rotating axisymmetric body is exactly solvable and use this solution to determine the orientational dynamics of surface-driven microswimmers. Swimmers with a force-dipole moment exhibit precession around the axis of the odd viscosity. In addition, pushers show bimodal chirotaxis, i.e., alignment parallel or antiparallel to the axis, while pullers orbit in a plane perpendicular to it. A chiral swimmer that itself has a broken parity symmetry can exhibit unimodal chirotaxis and always align in the same direction.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part I: finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze three classes of time-reversal of a Markov process with Gaussian noise on a manifold. We first unveil a commutativity constraint for the most general of these time-reversals to be well defined. Then we give a triad of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stochastic process to be time-reversible. While most reversibility conditions in the literature require knowledge of the stationary probability, our conditions do not, and therefore can be analytically checked in a systematic way. We then show that the mathematical objects whose cancellation is required by our reversibility conditions play the role of independent sources of entropy production. Furthermore, we give a geometric interpretation of the so-called irreversible cycle-affinity as the vorticity of a certain vector field for a Riemannian geometry given by the diffusion tensor. We also discuss the relation between the time-reversability of the stochastic process and that of an associated deterministic dynamics: its Stratonovitch average. Finally, we show that a suitable choice of a reference measure - that can be considered as a prior or a gauge, depending on the context - allows to study a stochastic process in a way that is both coordinate-free and independent of the prescription used to define stochastic integrals. When this reference measure plays the role of a gauge choice, we interpret our previous results through the lens of gauge theory and prove them to be gauge-invariant.</description>

      <title>Consistent expansion of the Langevin propagator with application to entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is a developing theory for systems out of thermal equilibrium. It allows to formulate a wealth of nontrivial relations among thermodynamic quantities such as heat dissipation, excess work, and entropy production in generic nonequilibrium stochastic processes. A key quantity for the derivation of these relations is the propagator - the probability to observe a transition from one point in phase space to another after a given time. Here, applying stochastic Taylor expansions, we devise a formal expansion procedure for the propagator of overdamped Langevin dynamics. The three leading orders are obtained explicitly. The technique resolves the shortcomings of the current mathematical machinery for the calculation of the propagator. For the evaluation of the first two displacement cumulants, the leading order Gaussian propagator is sufficient. However, some functionals of the propagator, such as the entropy production, which we refer to as "first derivatives of the trajectory", need to be evaluated to a previously-unrecognized higher order. The method presented here can be extended to arbitrarily higher orders in order to accurately compute any other functional of the propagator.</description>
