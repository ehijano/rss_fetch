      <title>Edge-wave phase-shifts versus normal-mode phase-tilts in an Eady problem with a sloping boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One mechanistic interpretation of baroclinic instability is that of mutual constructive interference of Rossby edge-waves. While the two edge-waves and their relative phase-shifts are invoked as part of the mechanistic interpretation, the phase-tilts of the related normal modes are often presented instead. Here we highlight the differences between edge-wave phase-shifts and normal-mode phase-tilts, in the context of an Eady problem modified by the presence of a sloping boundary. We argue and present evidence that the normal-mode phase-tilt is potentially a misleading quantity to use, and edge-wave phase-shifts should be the ones that are mechanistically relevant. We also provide a clarification for the mechanistic rationalization for baroclinic instability in the presence of slopes (such as suppression of growth rates) that is valid over all parameter space, in contrast to previous attempts. We further present evidence that there is a strong correlation between quantities diagnosed from the GEOMETRIC framework with the edge-wave phase-shifts, but not the normal-mode phase-tilts. The result is noteworthy in that the geometric framework makes no explicit reference to the edge-wave structures in its construction, but the correlation suggests that in problems where edge-wave structures are not so well-defined or readily available, the GEOMETRIC framework should still capture mechanistic and dynamical information. Some implications for parameterization of baroclinic instability and relevant eddy-mean feedbacks are discussed. For completeness, we also provide an explicit demonstration that the linear instability problem of the present modified Eady problem is parity-time symmetric, and speculate on some suggestive links between parity-time symmetry, shear instability, and the edge-wave interaction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>
