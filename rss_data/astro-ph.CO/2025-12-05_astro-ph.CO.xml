      <title>Controlled Tension Forecasting: Quantifying Cross-Probe Biases in $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining DESI DR2 BAO, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SNe have reported mild but intriguing deviations from the LambdaCDM model. A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys.</description>

      <title>Testing warm dark matter with kinematics of the smallest galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every dark matter halo forms with a $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. For warm dark matter (WDM), these prompt cusps can be massive enough to influence the kinematics of dwarf galaxies. By implementing prompt cusps in the Galacticus galaxy formation model, we show that the measured velocity dispersions of Tucana V and Triangulum II are serious outliers for dwarf galaxies arising in WDM models. For thermal-relic dark matter, the three faintest Milky Way satellites together constrain the particle mass to be $m_\chi&gt;5.8$ keV at 95 percent confidence or $m_\chi&gt;9.4$ keV at 90 percent confidence. Improved velocity dispersion measurements for these systems could greatly refine this constraint, as could identification and kinematic characterization of more such galaxies.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with a Spectator Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.</description>

      <title>The impact of strong feedback on galaxy group scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.</description>

      <title>Confronting cosmic shear astrophysical uncertainties: DES Year 3 revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmology from weak gravitational lensing has been limited by astrophysical uncertainties in baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 3. Constraints on Inflation from Galaxy Power Spectra &amp; Bispectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.1\pm 7.4$, $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=719\pm 390$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-200\pm 100$ (at $68\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=200\pm 230$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-24\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.0\pm 4.1$, $18\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.</description>

      <title>Constraining regular primordial black holes with isocurvature gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses II: validation tests with an extended sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing images are subject to shape distortions due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight. The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|\gamma_{\rm LOS}| &gt; 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Hongmeng 21cm experiment on scattering dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering between dark matter and baryon can cool intergalactic medium temperature and deepen the 21cm signal. Such interactions have been proposed to explain the unusually deep 21cm absorption signal reported by EDGES in 2018. This paper explores the potential to detect dark matter - baryon scattering with the Hongmeng project, an upcoming lunar orbiting satellite experiment dedicated to measuring global 21cm signal between redshifts $11-46$. We self-consistently forward-model the simulated sky temperature data, jointly varying both the astrophysical and foreground models. We show that even with a very conservative observational strategy in which the experiment only takes data when both the Earth and the Sun are shielded by the Moon, Hongmeng can tighten the current constraints on dark matter - baryon scattering cross-section $\sigma_0$ by a factor of 21 after the full mission which lasts for five years. The prospective upper limit on $\sigma_0$ can reach $4 \times 10^{-43} {\rm cm^2}$ for dark matter masses between 0.1 MeV and 0.4 GeV. Even after only one month of observation, a factor of 3 improvement relative to current $\sigma_0$ limits can be expected.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from DESI and CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\tau$.</description>

      <title>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.</description>

      <title>A new connection between WIMP dark matter and the hierarchy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a direct link between the hierarchy problem and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): we suggest that the small mass of the Higgs boson arises from being dynamically driven to the scale of the WIMP. Such a special electroweak vacuum is singled out by lying close to the critical boundary of a phase transition, as recently explored in a new class of cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. They generically predict the Higgs potential to be destabilised just above the weak scale. Intriguingly, the requirement for new physics to achieve this coincides with two independently well-motivated expectations: a split spectrum of light fermions and heavy bosons, as anticipated from naturalness, and the so-called "WIMP miracle". A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than ~1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space.</description>

      <title>JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Popcorn EMRIs: Transient Gravitational Wave Signals and Their Analysis in Schwartz Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P&gt;1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Electroweak phase transition in SMEFT: Gravitational wave and collider complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electroweak first-order electroweak phase transition (FO-EWPT) within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework induced by dimension-6 operators. Such phenomena can be probed independently via \textit{di}-Higgs production at the collider experiments as well as via the detection of gravitational waves (GW). There are three dimension-6 SMEFT operators that simultaneously modify the Higgs potential at tree level and contribute to the \textit{di}-Higgs production at the hadron colliders. With \textit{di}-Higgs production being suppressed at current LHC runs, we aim to probe this production at high luminosity (HL) and high energy (HE) runs of the LHC to achieve better sensitivity of dimension-6 SMEFT operators. The correlations among these operators are analyzed in the context of probing FO-EWPT, emphasizing the complementarity between future GW observations and upgraded LHC searches.</description>

      <title>Inflation with a Growing Fifth Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation generally assumes a field with nonzero potential that leads to inflationary expansion happening at arbitrarily early times. We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.</description>

      <title>Stellar Bars in Jellyfish Galaxies: Statistical Insights into the Combined Role of Bars and Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational studies suggest that the interplay between internal and environmental mechanisms, in particular, the combined action of stellar bars and ram pressure stripping (RPS) may influence central star formation activity in jellyfish galaxies. However, current evidence relies on small samples, leaving open whether bars play a significant role during stripping. In this study, we analyse a sample about five times larger than those used in previous works, comprising 176 galaxies identified as RPS candidates based on optical morphological indicators such as asymmetries, debris tails, and displaced star-forming regions. To assess the impact of these processes, we examine radial $u-r$ colour profiles from SDSS imaging as tracers of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). We classify galaxies by bar presence and RPS signatures, and construct comparison samples through stepwise matching in stellar mass and environment to disentangle the individual and combined effects of bars and RPS on stellar population gradients. Our results show that central rejuvenation signals emerge in RPS candidate galaxies, becoming most evident when bars and RPS act together. Barred RPS galaxies are systematically bluer at all radii than their non-RPS counterparts, while unbarred systems display only mild or no central differences, suggesting that the observable outcome of RPS depends on the stripping stage. Furthermore, barred galaxies exhibit flatter central colour profiles than unbarred ones -- a robust signature across all matched configurations. These findings highlight the key role of bars in amplifying environmental effects on the stellar populations of jellyfish galaxies, underscoring how internal structures can modulate the observable signatures of environmental processes in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Z' portal dark matter from post-inflationary reheating: WIMPs, FIMPs, and UFOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark matter (DM) via a heavy $Z'$ mediator during the post-inflationary reheating epoch. In particular, we study production from three mechanisms which are smoothly connected to one another: WIMP-like freeze-out, FIMP-like freeze-in, and ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). This is the first systematic study of $Z'$ portal DM which includes UFO. We find that much of the available parameter space for keV to TeV DM lies in the UFO regime for $ 1 \text{ TeV}\lesssim M_{Z'} \lesssim 1 \text{ PeV}$. When the mediator mass $M_{Z'}$ is greater than both the DM mass and the reheating temperature, UFO is a robust mechanism for producing cold DM. Although UFO DM is initially "hot" after freeze-out, it can easily become cold before structure formation if freeze-out occurs during post-inflationary reheating. Compared to standard freeze-in, UFO can accommodate significantly stronger interaction strengths (stronger couplings and/or smaller mediator masses).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations of Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production from isocurvature perturbations in spectator scalar fields during inflation. These energetically subdominant fields develop blue-tilted power spectra through inflationary dynamics, generating second-order scalar perturbations that source a stochastic GW background. The mechanism naturally satisfies CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced signals at smaller scales across a broad frequency range $10^{-20} - 1$ Hz. We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation. For spectator fields with effective masses $0.5 \lesssim m_{\chi,\mathrm{eff}}/H_I$, the resulting GW energy density reaches $\Omega_{\text{GW}} h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$-$10^{-12}$, accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and next-generation CMB experiments. Our analysis reveals that GW-induced constraints exceed current isocurvature bounds. We examine both unstable (curvaton-like) and stable (dark matter) spectator fields, demonstrating strong sensitivity to reheating temperature, inflaton-spectator coupling, and decay dynamics. This framework establishes isocurvature-sourced GWs as a powerful probe of early universe physics, enabling simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through coordinated multi-frequency GW observations.</description>

      <title>ELG$\times$LRG distribution through dark matter halo dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of DESI Y1 emission-line (ELGs) and luminous red (LRGs) galaxies at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.1$, including their cross-correlation (ELG$\times$LRG), using the AbacusSummit suite and a new Halo Occupation Model (HOMe) for galaxy multi-tracers. This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.</description>

Abstract: We study the linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars under generic perturbations. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we demonstrate that, as expected, the ground state is always mode-stable. Additionally, we identify several mode-stable spherically symmetric excited states, including stationary states of constant and radial polarization, as well as multi-frequency states in case that the spin-spin selfinteraction vanishes. The existence of stable excited states may have implications for spin-$1$ ultralight dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.
  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using "mini-supernovae" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</description>

      <title>A Chandra view of SPT-CL J0217-5014: a massive galaxy cluster at a cosmic intersection at z=0.53</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters trace the densest regions of the cosmic web and are crucial laboratories for studying the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM). We present a Chandra study of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0217-5014 ($z \sim 0.53$; $M_{\rm 500} \sim 3 \times 10^{14}~\rm M_{\odot}$), previously reported as a Swift serendipitous clusters with the highest Fe abundance ($\sim 1.3\pm 0.4$ $\rm Z_{\odot}$ within $\sim 1'.7$) and a potentially disturbed morphology. The X-ray morphology reveals a disturbed ICM with a surface brightness edge at $\sim 0'.26$ ($\sim 100$ kpc) to the west and a tail-like feature extending towards the east. The best-fit metal abundance within 1'.5 ($\sim 0.7\rm R_{500}$) is $0.61_{-0.23}^{+0.26}~\rm Z_{\odot}$. The derived central electron number density, entropy, and cooling time classify this system as a non-cool-core cluster, suggesting that merger activity has likely disrupted the possible pre-existing cool core. At larger radii ($\sim 1' - 2'$), we detect excess X-ray emission to the south, spatially aligned with a filamentary distribution of red galaxies, indicating ongoing accretion along an intracluster filament. Based on the DESI DR9 cross-matched optical clusters and photometric redshifts, we identify three nearby, lower-mass clusters that likely trace the large-scale structures, suggesting that SPT-CL~J0217-5014 is the primary node of a dynamically active environment where past mergers and anisotropic accretion along cosmic filaments have shaped the present-day ICM.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincar\'e sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Genesis Cosmology from the Smeared Null Energy Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state. To address theoretical concerns regarding the accumulation of negative energy, the smeared null energy condition (SNEC) has been proposed as a quantum-motivated, semi-local bound on NEC violation. In this work, we examine the implications of the SNEC conjecture for Genesis models, typically constructed within generalized Galileon theories. Our results demonstrate that SNEC imposes nontrivial restrictions on the viability of Genesis models, highlighting the SNEC conjecture as a powerful tool for constraining nonsingular cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics vs Teleodynamics: A Cosmological Divide?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that stationary black holes and the evolving universe belong to fundamentally different thermodynamic regimes: black holes obey ordinary Bekenstein Hawking thermodynamics, whereas cosmology necessarily follows memory-bearing teleodynamics. We show that teleodynamics is not valid for black holes, but is unavoidable in an expanding cosmology. This provides a dynamical, semi-classical realization of the thermodynamic split conjecture and identifies memory accumulation as the natural source of deviations from the area law in cosmology. Our results suggest that quantum gravity should not seek to extrapolate black hole thermodynamics to the universe, but instead must incorporate horizon memory as a fundamental microscopic ingredient and consider cosmological constructions consistent with that.</description>

      <title>Resonant neutrino self-interactions and the $H_0$ tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the previously unexplored resonant region of neutrino self-interactions. Current disagreement on late and early time observations of the Universe expansion could be solved with new physics acting before the recombination era. Nonstandard neutrino self-interactions are among the most appealing candidates to solve this issue since they could be testable in the near (or midterm) future. We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H_0$ eases from 4.9$\sigma$ (for $\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\sigma$. Albeit, this is driven mainly by the addition of extra radiation, with $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\sim 0.5$. The joint dataset which includes Planck, BAO, and $H_0$ prefers a nonzero interaction from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.9$\sigma$ significance in the range $0.5$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10$ eV. Although, this last result is obtained with data that are still in tension. These results add the last piece in the parameter space of neutrino self-interactions at the linear perturbation regime.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses I: shear and mass model parametrisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhomogeneities along the line of sight in strong gravitational lensing distort the images produced, in an effect called shear. If measurable, this shear may provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to traditional cosmic shear. We model 23 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the 'minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. Across the 23 lenses, we measure the LOS shear with a mean magnitude of $0.056 \pm 0.013$. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies in the LOS shear measurement with other lens model parameters, and the inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (\texttt{dbscan}) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virialised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between Coma's dark matter halo and the dark energy driving the expansion of the surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $(69.959 \pm 0.012) \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From \texttt{dbscan}, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$, which varies between $[72, 80]$~km/s/Mpc with different calibrations for the distance moduli. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior mass estimates. However, our mass estimates are based on fewer model assumptions in the member selection and require fewer members to attain the same precision. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova growth-rate measurement with LSST simulations: intrinsic scatter systematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($&gt;75\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.</description>

      <title>Viability of general relativity and modified gravity cosmologies using high-redshift cosmic probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several models based on General Relativity and Modified Gravity aim to reproduce the observed universe with precision comparable to the flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In this study, we investigate the consistency of some of these models with current high-redshift cosmic data, assessing their ability to simultaneously describe both the background expansion and matter clustering, using measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$, and the growth rate of structures $[f\sigma_8](z)$ through parametric and non-parametric methods. Our results indicate that background observables alone offer limited capacity to distinguish between models, while the inclusion of growth of structures data proves useful in revealing deviations, even if small. An $F(Q)$ model, the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM emerge as alternatives well supported by data, closely matching the growth data and showing performance comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, as revealed by the Akaike Information Criterion. In contrast, $F(R)$ models are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM and $F(Q)$. However, according to the Bayesian Information Criterion, $\Lambda$CDM remains the preferred model among the models analysed. These analyses illustrate the usefulness of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to explore the observational viability of alternative cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Power Spectrum Emulators from Neural Networks and Tree-Based Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 Quijote simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator is built in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$, the total neutrino mass $M_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical Framework of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution: Highlighting a possible tension between Demographics and Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by \texttt{JWST}, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit numerical implementation of the Friedmann equations to model the expansion of the Universe in spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies. Using cosmological parameters from the Planck 2018 results for the concordance LCDM model, we compute the evolution of the scale factor a(t) by integrating the Friedmann acceleration equation together with the continuity equation for a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state p = w*rho. The model includes radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a dark-energy component with constant equation-of-state parameter w. An explicit Euler scheme implemented in Python is used to evolve a(t) into the past and the future, allowing exploration of the qualitative behavior of the expansion for different values of w, including the LCDM case (w = -1), phantom energy (w &lt; -1), and values associated with domain walls and cosmic strings. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the standard radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated expansion regimes. The code is simple and modular, and is intended as a computational and pedagogical tool for undergraduate and graduate cosmology courses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the audible axion mechanism, axion-like particles source primordial gravitational waves via their coupling to a dark Abelian gauge field. The original setup, however, relies on a large axion decay constant and coupling to produce sizable signals. In this article, we show that delaying the onset of axion oscillations opens up the testable parameter space and reduces the required coupling to $\alpha \gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, we investigate the emission of gravitational waves via the axion coupling to the Standard Model photon in the presence of Schwinger pair production, generating a strong signal in the $\mu$Hz or ultra-high frequency range. Cosmological constraints and gravitational wave projections are provided for both scenarios.</description>

      <title>From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provide a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryon Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16), two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3), and using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Planck likelihood. The results for $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$ in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, $\Omega_D$, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables, thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.</description>

      <title>Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffuse starlight extending throughout massive galaxy clusters, known as intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus "star-tagging" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar "splashback" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.</description>

      <title>Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of "excitation correction" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</description>

      <title>Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts with Einstein Probe and Space-Based Multi-band Astronomical Variable Objects Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive, low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z&gt;6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z&gt;6$ of $&lt;0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $&lt;0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z&gt;5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z&lt;10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z&gt;10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z&gt;16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z&gt;16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for a sample of 6325 disk galaxies. We utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT, while also showing a tendency to align perpendicular to the major axis. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_* \sim 10^{10}-10^{10.5}M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide new empirical evidence for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</description>

      <title>Natural inflation in Palatini $F(R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials. In this study, we examine natural inflation and show that its consistency with observational data can be restored when the model is embedded within $F(R)$ Palatini gravity, specifically for $F(R) = R + \alpha R^n$ with $7/4 \lesssim n \leq 2$. For completeness, we also demonstrate that models with $n &gt; 2$ do not yield comparable improvements, achieving partial agreement with the data only in the limit $n \rightarrow 2$.</description>
