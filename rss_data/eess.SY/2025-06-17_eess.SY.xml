      <title>C2PO: Coherent Co-packaged Optics using offset-QAM-16 for Beyond PAM-4 Optical I/O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).
  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.</description>

      <title>The Milieu, Science &amp; Logic of Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'The cardinal sin in control is to believe that the plant is given' Karl Astrom. Astrom, a towering figure of control theory and practice and awardee of the 1993 IEEE Medal of Honor for his work on adaptive control, provides this assessment of the obstinate part of realizing a feedback controller. And yet we are exhorted to rely on solely-data-driven methods of control design skipping the modeling and plant identification phases entirely. What is going on? Whom should we trust? How do we reconcile the implied ease (or indeed avoidance) of modeling with the steely focus on robustness of the control and the capacity of feedback to accommodate uncertainty? This paper seeks to investigate this subject with the objective of appreciating not whom to trust but what are the circumstances where the direct paradigm of control design from any lightly qualified data set provides a sensible way forward. Here is a clue: It depends on the confidence of your contentions about the plant system, the detailed data themselves and your appetite for failure.
  The paper attempts to segue repeatedly between the broad philosophical context and hard engineering examples. To instantiate ideas and add detail to vagaries, we incorporate a number of examples, each validated by their demonstrated commercial and industrial viability and each terminating with ein Blickwinkel or perspective in German. As David Wallace-Wells poses, before investing hundreds of billions of dollars we really ought to ask what is the trillion-dollar problem which might potentially be solved. By sticking to industrially proven technologies, we hope to delineate what works suitably well in practice or was judged worthy of the risk.</description>

      <title>Similar Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems over Directed Acyclic Graphs via Matrix-Weighted Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief proposes a distributed formation control strategy via matrix-weighted Laplacian that can achieve a similar formation in 2-D planar using inter-agent relative displacement measurement. Formation patterns that include translation, rotation, and scaling can be characterized by the null space of the matrix-weighted Laplacian associated with the topological graph. The main contribution of this brief is to extend the similar formation problem of undirected graphs to directed acyclic graphs and provide the necessary algebraic criteria for leader selection. Stability analysis, illustrative examples, and simulation results are provided.</description>

      <title>Adding links wisely: how an influencer seeks for leadership in opinion dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of leadership development for an external influencer using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, where the influencer is modeled as a fully stubborn agent and leadership is quantified by social power. The influencer seeks to maximize her social power by strategically adding a limited number of links to regular agents. This optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the absorbing probability to the influencer in an augmented Markov chain. The resulting objective function is both monotone and submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution. To handle large-scale networks efficiently, a random walk sampling over the Markov chain is employed to reduce computational complexity. Analytical characterizations of the solution are provided for both low and high stubbornness of regular agents. Specific network topologies are also examined: for complete graphs with rank-one weight matrices, the problem reduces to a hyperbolic 0-1 programmming problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; for symmetric ring graphs with circulant weight matrices and uniform agent stubbornness, the optimal strategy involves selecting agents that are sufficiently dispersed across the network. Numerical simulations are presented for illustration.</description>

      <title>Less Conservative Adaptive Gain-scheduling Control for Continuous-time Systems with Polytopic Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of adaptive gain-scheduling controller is discussed for continuous-time linear models characterized by polytopic uncertainties. The proposed approach computes the control law assuming the parameters as uncertain and adaptively provides an estimate for the gain-scheduling implementation. Conservativeness is reduced using our recent results on describing uncertainty: i) a structural relaxation that casts the parameters as outer terms and introduces slack variables; and ii) a precise topological representation that describes the mismatch between the uncertainty and its estimate. Numerical examples illustrate a high degree of relaxation in comparison with the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-Barycenter Consensus for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents' joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and final coordination success.</description>

      <title>Constrained Diffusers for Safe Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in planning and control tasks due to their ability to represent multimodal distributions over actions and trajectories. However, ensuring safety under constraints remains a critical challenge for diffusion models. This paper proposes Constrained Diffusers, a novel framework that incorporates constraints into pre-trained diffusion models without retraining or architectural modifications. Inspired by constrained optimization, we apply a constrained Langevin sampling mechanism for the reverse diffusion process that jointly optimizes the trajectory and realizes constraint satisfaction through three iterative algorithms: projected method, primal-dual method and augmented Lagrangian approaches. In addition, we incorporate discrete control barrier functions as constraints for constrained diffusers to guarantee safety in online implementation. Experiments in Maze2D, locomotion, and pybullet ball running tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve constraint satisfaction with less computation time, and are competitive to existing methods in environments with static and time-varying constraints.</description>

      <title>GenControl: Generative AI-Driven Autonomous Design of Control Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Experimental Verification of a Time-Domain Load Identification Method for Single-Phase Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental validation of a time-domain load parameter determination method for single-phase circuits. The verification is performed in a state-of-the-art smart grid laboratory equipped with power hardware and real-time emulators. The proposed method enables the identification of circuit parameters using only instantaneous voltage and current measurements at the point of common coupling. The experimental setup includes a range of test cases covering linear and non-sinusoidal single-phase conditions. Voltage and current waveforms are acquired, preprocessed, and used to calculate the relevant circuit parameters. The experimental results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy and robustness, with minimal percentage errors across all test cases. The identified parameters show excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations, confirming the validity and applicability of the proposed method to identify the load of single-phase systems. This validation highlights the potential of the method for improved monitoring, control, and protection of smart grids, paving the way for future extensions to three-phase systems and real-time implementations.</description>

      <title>ECLIP: Energy-efficient and Practical Co-Location of ML Inference on Spatially Partitioned GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI inference becomes mainstream, research has begun to focus on improving the energy consumption of inference servers. Inference kernels commonly underutilize a GPU's compute resources and waste power from idling components. To improve utilization and energy efficiency, multiple models can co-locate and share the GPU. However, typical GPU spatial partitioning techniques often experience significant overheads when reconfiguring spatial partitions, which can waste additional energy through repartitioning overheads or non-optimal partition configurations. In this paper, we present ECLIP, a framework to enable low-overhead energy-efficient kernel-wise resource partitioning between co-located inference kernels. ECLIP minimizes repartitioning overheads by pre-allocating pools of CU masked streams and assigns optimal CU assignments to groups of kernels through our resource allocation optimizer. Overall, ECLIP achieves an average of 13% improvement to throughput and 25% improvement to energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging Data-Driven and Physics-Based Models: A Consensus Multi-Model Kalman Filter for Robust Vehicle State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle state estimation presents a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving systems, requiring both physical interpretability and the ability to capture complex nonlinear behaviors across diverse operating conditions. Traditional methodologies often rely exclusively on either physics-based or data-driven models, each with complementary strengths and limitations that become most noticeable during critical scenarios. This paper presents a novel consensus multi-model Kalman filter framework that integrates heterogeneous model types to leverage their complementary strengths while minimizing individual weaknesses. We introduce two distinct methodologies for handling covariance propagation in data-driven models: a Koopman operator-based linearization approach enabling analytical covariance propagation, and an ensemble-based method providing unified uncertainty quantification across model types without requiring pretraining. Our approach implements an iterative consensus fusion procedure that dynamically weighs different models based on their demonstrated reliability in current operating conditions. The experimental results conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Equinox vehicle demonstrate performance improvements over single-model techniques, with particularly significant advantages during challenging maneuvers and varying road conditions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Condition Monitoring with Machine Learning: A Data-Driven Framework for Quantifying Wind Turbine Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime.</description>

      <title>Online-Optimized Gated Radial Basis Function Neural Network-Based Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time adaptive control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and time-varying disturbances demands precise modeling and robust parameter adaptation. While existing neural network-based strategies struggle with computational inefficiency or inadequate temporal dependencies, this study proposes a hybrid control framework integrating a Temporal-Gated Radial Basis Function (TGRBF) network with a nonlinear robust controller. The TGRBF synergizes radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) through dynamic gating, enabling efficient offline system identification and online temporal modeling with minimal parameter overhead (14.5% increase vs. RBFNNs). During control execution, an event-triggered optimization mechanism activates momentum-explicit gradient descent to refine network parameters, leveraging historical data to suppress overfitting while maintaining real-time feasibility. Concurrently, the nonlinear controller adaptively tunes its gains via Jacobian-driven rules derived from the TGRBF model, ensuring rapid error convergence and disturbance rejection. Lyapunov-based analysis rigorously guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of both tracking errors and adaptive parameters. Simulations on a nonlinear benchmark system demonstrate the framework's superiority: compared to PID and fixed-gain robust controllers, the proposed method reduces settling time by 14.2%, limits overshoot to 10%, and achieves 48.4% lower integral time-weighted absolute error under dynamic disturbances. By unifying data-driven adaptability with stability-guaranteed control, this work advances real-time performance in partially observable, time-varying industrial systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient operation of greenhouses is essential for enhancing crop yield while minimizing energy costs. This paper investigates a control strategy that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize economic benefits in autonomous greenhouses. Previous research has explored the use of RL and MPC for greenhouse control individually, or by using MPC as the function approximator for the RL agent. This study introduces the RL-Guided MPC framework, where a RL policy is trained and then used to construct a terminal cost and terminal region constraint for the MPC optimization problem. This approach leverages the ability to handle uncertainties of RL with MPC's online optimization to improve overall control performance. The RL-Guided MPC framework is compared with both MPC and RL via numerical simulations. Two scenarios are considered: a deterministic environment and an uncertain environment. Simulation results demonstrate that, in both environments, RL-Guided MPC outperforms both RL and MPC with shorter prediction horizons.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance of Online Feedback Optimization for Distribution Grid Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into sub-transmission systems has enabled new opportunities for flexibility provision in ancillary services such as frequency and voltage support, as well as congestion management. This paper investigates the stability and performance of Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers in ensuring reliable flexibility provision. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, emphasizing safe transitions between system states within the Feasible Operating Region (FOR). We evaluate the controller's stability and performance through simulations of transitions to the vertices of the FOR, analyzing the impact of tuning parameters. The study demonstrates that controller stability is sensitive to parameter tuning, particularly gain and sensitivity approximations. Results demonstrate that improper tuning can lead to oscillatory or unstable behavior, highlighting the need for systematic parameter selection to ensure reliable operation across the full flexibility range.</description>

      <title>EPC Framework for BESS Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are critical for modern power networks, supporting grid services such as frequency regulation, peak shaving, and black start. Delivering a BESS under an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) model requires a concise methodology that balances regulatory compliance, technical details, and schedule efficiency. This paper presents a streamlined, five step EPC framework covering feasibility assessment, permitting, procurement, construction, and commissioning. A Danish demonstration (the BOSS project on Bornholm) serves as a case study.</description>

      <title>Aggregating Inverter-Based Resources for Fast Frequency Response: A Nash Bargaining Game-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for grid-level frequency regulation by aggregating inverter-based resources (IBRs). Virtual power plants (VPPs), acting as aggregators, can efficiently respond to dynamic response requirements from the grid. Through parametric modeling, grid-level frequency regulation requirements are accurately quantified and translated into a feasible parameter region defined by device-level parameters. Based on this feasible region, an MOO model is developed to address the conflicting demands of IBRs during frequency response. A Nash bargaining game-based approach is then employed to optimally allocate regulation requirements within the VPP, balancing the various demands of the IBRs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing frequency stability and improving coordination among IBRs.</description>

      <title>Voltage Stability of Inverter-Based Systems: Impact of Parameters and Irrelevance of Line Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates voltage stability in inverter-based power systems concerning fold and saddle-node bifurcations. An analytical expression is derived for the sensitivity of the stability margin using the normal vector to the bifurcation hypersurface. Such information enables efficient identification of effective control parameters in mitigating voltage instability. Comprehensive analysis reveals that reactive loading setpoint and current controller's feedforward gain are the most influential parameters for enhancing voltage stability in a grid-following (GFL) inverter system, while the voltage controller's feedforward gain plays a dominant role in a grid-forming (GFM) inverter. Notably, both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that transmission line dynamics have no impact on fold/saddle-node bifurcations in these systems. Results in this paper provide insights for efficient analysis and control in future inverter-dominated power systems through reductions in parameter space and model complexity.</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Detection Method for Internal Short Circuits in Single Lithium-ion Cells Using Pseudo Open-Circuit Voltage Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a lightweight, model-free online diagnostic framework for detecting internal short circuits (ISC) in single lithium-ion cells under dynamic operating conditions. The core of the method lies in computing the first-order difference of pseudo open-circuit voltage ($\boldsymbol{\mathrm{OCV}_{\text{pseudo}}}$) to extract high-frequency deviations caused by ISC events from low-frequency polarization variations. The method relies solely on terminal voltage, current measurements, and an offline $R_0$--SOC look-up table, thereby eliminating the need for electrochemical or equivalent-circuit observers. Validated on ten real and one false fault scenarios, the proposed approach achieves a 100\% detection success rate with no missed or false alarms. In addition, the proposed method exhibits extremely low computational and memory requirements, making it highly suitable for real-time deployment in battery management systems (BMS).</description>

      <title>High-gain model-following control for trajectory tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider trajectory tracking for minimum-phase nonlinear systems in Byrnes-Isidori form using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. The tracking problem is motivated by a hierarchical control concept where a higher-level instance provides the reference trajectory at run-time. We present a computational efficient implementation of the feedback linearisation MFC design, and apply high-gain feedback in the process control loop (PCL) to achieve practical tracking in presence of Lipschitz perturbations. Our main results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be attenuated using MFC. We demonstrate the results via an automotive case study considering advanced engine-based cruise control.</description>

Abstract: In technical communique, we develop a graphical design procedure for reset controllers for unstable LTI plants based on recent developments on Scaled Relative Graph analysis, yielding an $L_2$-gain performance bound. The stabilizing controller consists of a second order reset element in parallel with a proportional gain. The proposed method goes beyond existing approaches that are limited to stable systems only, providing a well-applicable approach to design problems in practice where the plant is unstable.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Polynomial Zonotopes: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis in Hybrid Nonaffine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability analysis for hybrid nonaffine systems remains computationally challenging, as existing set representations--including constrained, polynomial, and hybrid zonotopes--either lose tightness under high-order nonaffine maps or suffer exponential blow-up after discrete jumps. This paper introduces Hybrid Polynomial Zonotope (HPZ), a novel set representation that combines the mode-dependent generator structure of hybrid zonotopes with the algebraic expressiveness of polynomial zonotopes. HPZs compactly encode non-convex reachable states across modes by attaching polynomial exponents to each hybrid generator, enabling precise capture of high-order state-input couplings without vertex enumeration. We develop a comprehensive library of HPZ operations, including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and intersection. Theoretical analysis and computational experiments demonstrate that HPZs achieve superior tightness preservation and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches for hybrid system reachability analysis.</description>

      <title>BattBee: Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Early Detection of Thermal Runaway Triggered by Internal Short Circuits for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the enabling power source for transportation electrification. However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway (TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper. First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk management.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Method for Estimating Flicker in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parallel GPU-accelerated solver for branch Model Predictive Control problems. Based on iterative LQR methods, our solver exploits the tree-sparse structure and implements temporal parallelism using the parallel scan algorithm. Consequently, the proposed solver enables parallelism across both the prediction horizon and the scenarios. In addition, we utilize an augmented Lagrangian method to handle general inequality constraints. We compare our solver with state-of-the-art numerical solvers in two automated driving applications. The numerical results demonstrate that, compared to CPU-based solvers, our solver achieves competitive performance for problems with short horizons and small-scale trees, while outperforming other solvers on large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Deceptive Path Planning: A Bayesian Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how an autonomous agent can transmit information through its motion in an adversarial setting. We consider scenarios where an agent must reach its goal while deceiving an intelligent observer about its destination. We model this interaction as a dynamic Bayesian game between a mobile Attacker with a privately known goal and a Defender who infers the Attacker's intent to allocate defensive resources effectively. We use Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE) as our solution concept and propose a computationally efficient approach to find it. In the resulting equilibrium, the Defender employs a simple Markovian strategy, while the Attacker strategically balances deception and goal efficiency by stochastically mixing shortest and non-shortest paths to manipulate the Defender's beliefs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of our PBNE-based strategies over existing methods based on one-sided optimization.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Foundation Models for IoT: Taxonomy and Criteria-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security &amp; privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.</description>

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is the cornerstone of the modern IT industry. However, managing this infrastructure effectively requires considerable manual effort from the DevOps engineering team. We make a case for developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to automate cloud infrastructure management tasks. In a preliminary study, we investigate the potential for AI agents to use different cloud/user interfaces such as software development kits (SDK), command line interfaces (CLI), Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platforms, and web portals. We report takeaways on their effectiveness on different management tasks, and identify research challenges and potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Role of Uncertainty in Model Development and Control Design for a Manufacturing Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform machines, especially in the micro scale manufacturing, which requires high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for high level of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment. Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity) etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high-precision microprocessors, which are utilized in nowadays robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, but a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system can reduce various uncertainties to a great amount.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>Explosive Output to Enhance Jumping Ability: A Variable Reduction Ratio Design Paradigm for Humanoid Robots Knee Joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the explosive power output of the knee joints is critical for improving the agility and obstacle-crossing capabilities of humanoid robots. However, a mismatch between the knee-to-center-of-mass (CoM) transmission ratio and jumping demands, coupled with motor performance degradation at high speeds, restricts the duration of high-power output and limits jump performance. To address these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design paradigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive output during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee kinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction ratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly increases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes motor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained high-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod mechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization guided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation demonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical improvement of 28.1\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints). Integrated into a humanoid robot, the proposed design enabled a 1.1 m long jump, a 0.5 m vertical jump, and a 0.5 m box jump.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Encrypted Policy Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient encrypted policy synthesis to develop privacy-preserving model-based reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate that the relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework offers a computationally convenient linear and ``min-free'' structure for value iteration, enabling a direct and efficient integration of fully homomorphic encryption with bootstrapping into policy synthesis. Convergence and error bounds are analyzed as encrypted policy synthesis propagates errors under the presence of encryption-induced errors including quantization and bootstrapping. Theoretical analysis is validated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RERL framework in integrating FHE for encrypted policy synthesis.</description>

      <title>Automated Heuristic Design for Unit Commitment Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving the UC problem.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Generative Agents for Energy Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations remains challenging due to inherent uncertainties, behavioral complexities, and limited empirical data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging generative agents--artificial agents powered by large language models--to realistically simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. We demonstrate that these agents behave more optimally and rationally in simpler market scenarios, while their performance becomes more variable and suboptimal as task complexity rises. Furthermore, the agents exhibit heterogeneous customer preferences, consistently maintaining distinct, persona-driven reasoning patterns. Our findings highlight the potential value of integrating generative agents into energy management simulations to improve the design and effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs.</description>

      <title>Federated Neuroevolution O-RAN: Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning xApps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL (DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing the additional computational load.</description>

      <title>KCLNet: Physics-Informed Power Flow Prediction via Constraints Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust, they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however, they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work, we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations, thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.</description>

      <title>Counterexample-Guided Synthesis of Robust Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained popularity for training candidate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to satisfy the CBF conditions on a finite set of sampled states. However, since the CBF is unknown a priori, it is unclear which sampled states belong to its zero-superlevel set and must satisfy the CBF conditions, and which ones lie outside it. Existing approaches define a set in which all sampled states are required to satisfy the CBF conditions, thus introducing conservatism. In this paper, we address this issue for robust discrete-time CBFs (R-DTCBFs). Furthermore, we propose a class of R-DTCBFs that can be used in an online optimization problem to synthesize safe controllers for general discrete-time systems with input constraints and bounded disturbances. To train such an R-DTCBF that is valid not only on sampled states but also across the entire region, we employ a verification algorithm iteratively in a counterexample-guided approach. We apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents SEGO (Semantic Graph Ontology), a cognitive mapping architecture designed to integrate geometric perception, semantic reasoning, and explanation generation into a unified framework for human-centric collaborative robotics. SEGO constructs dynamic cognitive scene graphs that represent not only the spatial configuration of the environment but also the semantic relations and ontological consistency among detected objects. The architecture seamlessly combines SLAM-based localization, deep-learning-based object detection and tracking, and ontology-driven reasoning to enable real-time, semantically coherent mapping.</description>

      <title>Delayed Expansion AGT: Kinodynamic Planning with Application to Tractor-Trailer Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics. The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster. To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching. Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of 10x acceleration compared to a previous method.</description>

Abstract: This paper comprehensively surveys research trends in imitation learning for contact-rich robotic tasks. Contact-rich tasks, which require complex physical interactions with the environment, represent a central challenge in robotics due to their nonlinear dynamics and sensitivity to small positional deviations. The paper examines demonstration collection methodologies, including teaching methods and sensory modalities crucial for capturing subtle interaction dynamics. We then analyze imitation learning approaches, highlighting their applications to contact-rich manipulation. Recent advances in multimodal learning and foundation models have significantly enhanced performance in complex contact tasks across industrial, household, and healthcare domains. Through systematic organization of current research and identification of challenges, this survey provides a foundation for future advancements in contact-rich robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>From Data-Driven to Purpose-Driven Artificial Intelligence: Systems Thinking for Data-Analytic Automation of Patient Care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled In-context Learning for Wireless Network Optimization: A Case Study of Power Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) has recently been considered a promising technique for many fields. This work explores LLM-based wireless network optimization via in-context learning. To showcase the potential of LLM technologies, we consider the base station (BS) power control as a case study, a fundamental but crucial technique that is widely investigated in wireless networks. Different from existing machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed in-context learning algorithm relies on LLM's inference capabilities. It avoids the complexity of tedious model training and hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which is a well-known bottleneck of many ML algorithms. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first describes the target task via formatted natural language, and then designs the in-context learning framework and demonstration examples. After that, it considers two cases, namely discrete-state and continuous-state problems, and proposes state-based and ranking-based methods to select appropriate examples for these two cases, respectively. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable performance as conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques without dedicated model training or fine-tuning. Such an efficient and low-complexity approach has great potential for future wireless network optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust control problems have significant practical implications since external disturbances can significantly impact the performance of control methods. Existing robust control methods excel at control-affine systems but fail at neural network dynamic models. Developing robust control methods for such systems remains a complex challenge. In this paper, we focus on robust tracking methods for neural network dynamic models. We first propose a reachability analysis tool designed for this system and then introduce how to reformulate a robust tracking problem with reachable sets. In addition, we prove the existence of a feedback policy that bounds the growth of reachable sets over an infinite horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations of the tracking task, where we compare it with a standard tube MPC method.</description>

      <title>Distributed Attack-Resilient Platooning Against False Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed vehicle platooning control and coordination strategy. We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combining a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in an extensive simulation study against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and a robust control scheme. We additionally extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Deadlocks Is Not Enough: Analysis and Resolution of Blocked Airplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis and resolution of a pathological phenomenon in airplane encounters called blocking mode. As autonomy in airplane systems increases, a pathological phenomenon can be observed in two-aircraft encounter scenarios, where airplanes stick together and fly in parallel for an extended period. This parallel flight results in a temporary blocking that significantly delays progress. In contrast to widely studied deadlocks in multi-robot systems, such transient blocking is often overlooked in existing literature. Since such prolonged parallel flying places high-speed airplanes at elevated risks of near-miss collisions, encounter conflicts must be resolved as quickly as possible in the context of aviation. We develop a mathematical model for a two-airplane encounter system that replicates this blocking phenomenon. Using this model, we analyze the conditions under which blocking occurs, quantify the duration of the blocking period, and demonstrate that the blocking condition is significantly less restrictive than that of deadlock. Based on these analytical insights, we propose an intention-aware strategy with an adaptive priority mechanism that enables efficient resolution of ongoing blocking phenomena while also incidentally eliminating deadlocks. Notably, the developed strategy does not rely on central coordination and communications that can be unreliable in harsh situations. The analytical findings and the proposed resolution strategy are validated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Control for LQR with Unknown Packet Loss Rate Using Finite Channel Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem over an unknown Bernoulli packet loss channel. The unknown loss rate is estimated using finite channel samples and a certainty-equivalence (CE) optimal controller is then designed by treating the estimate as the true rate. The stabilizing capability and sub-optimality of the CE controller critically depend on the estimation error of loss rate. For discrete-time linear systems, we provide a stability threshold for the estimation error to ensure closed-loop stability, and analytically quantify the sub-optimality in terms of the estimation error and the difference in modified Riccati equations. Next, we derive the upper bound on sample complexity for the CE controller to be stabilizing. Tailored results with less conservatism are delivered for scalar systems and n-dimensional systems with invertible input matrix. Moreover, we establish a sufficient condition, independent of the unknown loss rate, to verify whether the CE controller is stabilizing in a probabilistic sense. Finally, numerical examples are used to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</description>

      <title>Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Chemical Reaction Networks Using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Settling Time of Finite-Time Stable Systems using Sum of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-time stability (FTS) of a differential equation guarantees that solutions reach a given equilibrium point in finite time, where the time of convergence depends on the initial state of the system. For traditional stability notions such as exponential stability, the convex optimization framework of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) enables computation of polynomial Lyapunov functions to certify stability. However, finite-time stable systems are characterized by non-Lipschitz, non-polynomial vector fields, rendering standard SoS methods inapplicable. To this end, we show that computation of a non-polynomial Lyapunov function certifying finite-time stability can be reformulated as feasibility of a set of polynomial inequalities under a particular transformation. As a result, SoS can be utilized to verify FTS and obtain a bound on the settling time. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the conditions in both certifying finite-time stability and bounding the settling time.</description>

      <title>Object State Estimation Through Robotic Active Interaction for Biological Autonomous Drilling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</description>

      <title>CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.</description>

      <title>Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.</description>
