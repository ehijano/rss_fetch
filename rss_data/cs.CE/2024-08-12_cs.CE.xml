      <title>The LATIN-PGD methodology to nonlinear dynamics and quasi-brittle materials for future earthquake engineering applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a first implementation of the LArge Time INcrement (LATIN) method along with the model reduction technique called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) for solving nonlinear low-frequency dynamics problems when dealing with a quasi-brittle isotropic damage constitutive relations. The present paper uses the Time-Discontinuous Galerkin Method (TDGM) for computing the temporal contributions of the space-time separate-variables solution of the LATIN-PGD approach, which offers several advantages when considering a high number of DOFs in time. The efficiency of the method is tested for the case of a 3D bending beam, where results and benchmarks comparing LATIN-PGD to classical time-incremental Newmark/Quasi-Newton nonlinear solver are presented. This work represents a first step towards taking into account uncertainties and carrying out more complex parametric studies imposed by seismic risk assessment.</description>

      <title>A reduced simulation applied to viscoelastic fatigue of polymers using a time multi-scale approach based on Partition of Unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of viscoelastic time-evolution problems described by a large number of internal variables and with a large spectrum of relaxation times requires high computational resources for their resolution. Furthermore, the internal variables evolution is described by a set of linear differential equations which involves many time scales. In this context, the use of a space-time PGD approximation is proposed here to boost their resolution, where the temporal functions are constructed following a multi-scale strategy along with the Partition of Unity method, in order to catch each dynamic efficiently. The feasibility and the robustness of the method are discussed in the case of a polymer in a non-equilibrium state under cyclic loading.</description>

      <title>AcousAF: Acoustic Sensing-Based Atrial Fibrillation Detection System for Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution. However, these systems have various applicability issues, such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present AcousAF, a novel AF detection system based on acoustic sensors of smartphones. Particularly, we explore the potential of pulse wave acquisition from the wrist using smartphone speakers and microphones. In addition, we propose a well-designed framework comprised of pulse wave probing, pulse wave extraction, and AF detection to ensure accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 20 participants utilizing our custom data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our system, with 92.8% accuracy, 86.9% precision, 87.4% recall, and 87.1% F1 Score.</description>

      <title>A Low-Frequency-Stable Higher-Order Isogeometric Discretization of the Augmented Electric Field Integral Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution investigates the connection between isogeometric analysis and integral equation methods for full-wave electromagnetic problems up to the low-frequency limit. The proposed spline-based integral equation method allows for an exact representation of the model geometry described in terms of non-uniform rational B-splines without meshing. This is particularly useful when high accuracy is required or when meshing is cumbersome for instance during optimization of electric components. The augmented electric field integral equation is adopted and the deflation method is applied, so the low-frequency breakdown is avoided. The extension to higher-order basis functions is analyzed and the convergence rate is discussed. Numerical experiments on academic and realistic test cases demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach in multivariate pair trading, termed the Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We present a method for selectively forming a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities simultaneously. To address quantitative conflicts from multiple trading signals, a novel bi-objective convex optimization formulation is designed to balance investor preferences between profitability and risk tolerance. We understand that cryptocurrencies carry significant financial risks. Therefore this process includes tunable parameters such as volatility penalties and action thresholds. In experiments conducted in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022, which encompassed a vigorous bull run followed by a bear run, the OTT achieved an annualized profit of 15.49%. Additionally, supplementary experiments detailed in the appendix extend the applicability of OTT to other major cryptocurrencies in the post-COVID period, validating the model's robustness and effectiveness in various market conditions. The arbitrage operation offers a new perspective on trading, without requiring external shorting or holding the intermediate during the arbitrage period. As a note of caution, this study acknowledges the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investments, which can be subject to significant volatility and potential loss.</description>
