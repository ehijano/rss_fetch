      <title>Lithological Controls on the Permeability of Geologic Faults: Surrogate Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault zones exhibit complex and heterogeneous permeability structures influenced by stratigraphic, compositional, and structural factors, making them critical yet uncertain components in subsurface flow modeling. In this study, we investigate how lithological controls influence fault permeability using the PREDICT framework: a probabilistic workflow that couples stochastic fault geometry generation, physically constrained material placement, and flow-based upscaling. The flow-based upscaling step, however, is a very computationally expensive component of the workflow and presents a major bottleneck that makes global sensitivity analysis (GSA) intractable, as it requires millions of model evaluations. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network surrogate to emulate the flow-based upscaling step. This surrogate model dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, thereby making GSA feasible. The surrogate-model-enabled GSA reveals new insights into the effects of lithological controls on fault permeability. In addition to identifying dominant parameters and negligible ones, the analysis uncovers significant nonlinear interactions between parameters that cannot be captured by traditional local sensitivity methods.</description>

      <title>The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL): Challenges and Solutions to Data Harmonization, Labeling, and Provenance in Fusion Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion energy research increasingly depends on the ability to integrate heterogeneous, multimodal datasets from high-resolution diagnostics, control systems, and multiscale simulations. The sheer volume and complexity of these datasets demand the development of new tools capable of systematically harmonizing and extracting knowledge across diverse modalities. The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL) is introduced as a unified workflow instrument that performs uncertainty-aware data harmonization, schema-compliant data fusion, and provenance-rich manual and automated labeling at scale. By embedding alignment, normalization, and labeling within a reproducible, operator-order-aware framework, dFL reduces time-to-analysis by greater than 50X (e.g., enabling &gt;200 shots/hour to be consistently labeled rather than a handful per day), enhances label (and subsequently training) quality, and enables cross-device comparability. Case studies from DIII-D demonstrate its application to automated ELM detection and confinement regime classification, illustrating its potential as a core component of data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control in future burning plasma devices.</description>

      <title>The Role of Deep Mesoscale Eddies in Ensemble Forecast Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present forecasting efforts rely on assimilation of observational data captured in the upper ocean (&lt; 1000 m depth). These observations constrain the upper ocean and minimally influence the deep ocean. Nevertheless, development of the full water column circulation critically depends upon the dynamical interactions between upper and deep fields. Forecasts demonstrate that the initialization of the deep field is influential for the development and evolution of the surface in the forecast. Deep initial conditions that better agree with observations have lower upper ocean uncertainty as the forecast progresses. Here, best and worst ensemble members in two 92-day forecasts are identified and contrasted in order to determine how the deep ocean differs between these groups. The forecasts cover the duration of the Loop Current Eddy Thor separation event, which coincides with available deep observations in the Gulf. Model member performance is assessed by comparing surface variables against verifying analysis and satellite altimeter data during the forecast time-period. Deep cyclonic and anticyclonic features are reviewed, and compared against deep observations, indicating subtle differences in locations of deep eddies at relevant times. These results highlight both the importance of deep circulation in the dynamics of the Loop Current system and more broadly motivate efforts to assimilate deep observations to better constrain the deep initial fields and improve surface predictions.</description>

      <title>Beyond empirical models: Discovering new constitutive laws in solids with graph-based equation discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Serviceability-Based Design of Reinforced Concrete Rail Bridges under Geometric Uncertainties induced by unforeseen events: A Surrogate Modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforced concrete rail bridges are essential components of railway infrastructure, where reliability, durability, and adaptability are key design priorities. However, the design process is often complicated by uncertainties stemming from unforeseen construction constraints, such as the need to reposition piers or alter geometric characteristics. These design adaptations can lead to repeated redesigns, added costs, and project delays if not anticipated in the early design stages, as well as significant computational overhead when using traditional finite element (FE) simulations. To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR). This methodology supports early-stage uncertainty-informed design, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of reinforced concrete rail bridges in the face of practical constraints and changing site conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>
