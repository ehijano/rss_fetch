      <title>WIN-PDQ: A Wiener-estimator-based projection-domain quantitative SPECT method that accounts for intra-regional uptake heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPECT can enable the quantification of activity uptake in lesions and at-risk organs in {\alpha}-particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapies ({\alpha}-RPTs). But this quantification is challenged by the low photon counts, complicated isotope physics, and the image-degrading effects in {\alpha}-RPT SPECT. Thus, strategies to optimize the SPECT system and protocol designs for the task of regional uptake quantification are needed. Objectively performing this task-based optimization requires a reliable (accurate and precise) regional uptake quantification method. Conventional reconstruction-based quantification (RBQ) methods have been observed to be erroneous for {\alpha}-RPT SPECT. Projection-domain quantification methods, which estimate regional uptake directly from SPECT projections, have demonstrated potential in providing reliable regional uptake estimates, but these methods assume constant uptake within the regions, an assumption that may not hold. To address these challenges, we propose WIN-PDQ, a Wiener-estimator-based projection-domain quantitative SPECT method. The method accounts for the heterogeneity within the regions of interest while estimating mean uptake. An early-stage evaluation of the method was conducted using 3D Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT of anthropomorphic phantoms with radium-223 uptake and lumpy-model-based intra-regional uptake heterogeneity. In this evaluation with phantoms of varying mean regional uptake and intra-regional uptake heterogeneity, the WIN-PDQ method yielded ensemble unbiased estimates and significantly outperformed both reconstruction-based and previously proposed projection-domain quantification methods. In conclusion, based on these preliminary findings, the proposed method is showing potential for estimating mean regional uptake in {\alpha}-RPTs and towards enabling the objective task-based optimization of SPECT system and protocol designs.</description>

      <title>Safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel device to monitor ischaemic stroke patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assessed the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel device to monitor ischaemic stroke patients. The device captured electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) data to compute an ECG-based metric termed the Electrocardiography Brain Perfusion index (EBPi), which may function as a proxy for cerebral blood flow (CBF). Seventeen ischaemic stroke patients wore the device for nine hours and reported feedback at 1, 3, 6 and 9 hours regarding user experience, comfort, and satisfaction (acceptability). Safety was assessed as the number of adverse events reported. Feasibility was assessed as the percentage of uninterrupted EEG/ECG data recorded (data capture efficiency). No adverse events were reported, only minor incidences of discomfort. Overall device comfort (92.5% +/- 10.3%) and data capture efficiency (95.8% +/- 6.8%) were very high with relatively low variance. The device did not restrict participants from receiving clinical care and rarely (n=6) restricted participants from undertaking routine tasks. This study provides a promising evidence base for the deployment of the device in a clinical setting. If clinically validated, EBPi may be able to detect CBF changes to monitor early neurological deterioration and treatment outcomes, thus filling an important gap in current monitoring options.</description>

      <title>AutoMRISimQA: an automated system for daily quality control of a 3T MRI simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A software system named AutoMRISimQA was developed to monitor the daily performance of a wide-bore 3T scanner(MRI) which was designed and dedicated to radiotherapy simulation. The system can monitor the performance of the MRI simulator not only by using image quality indices such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uniformity, ghosting and contrast but also performing a quick check of geometry accuracy as well as the external lasers quantitatively. It was implemented into the daily clinically workflow in 2013 and has been used for more than 10 years. It was also seamlessly integrated with QAtrack, allowing continuous monitoring of the consistency of the MRI simulator's performance.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Correlation of Epileptic Seizures with The Electrocardiography Brain Perfusion Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electrocardiography Brain Perfusion index (EBPi) is a novel electrocardiography (ECG)-based metric that may function as a proxy for cerebral blood flow (CBF). We investigated the spatio-temporal correlation between EBPi and epileptic seizure events. EBPi was computed retrospectively from clinical EEG and ECG data captured previously from 30 epilepsy patients during seizures. Significant EBPi changes were compared temporally with clinically defined ground-truth seizure onset and offset times. We also assessed the spatial correlation between EBPi metrics and clinically defined ground-truth seizure locations. A significant increase in EBPi was detected 10.5 s [-6, 53] (median [95% confidence interval (CI)]) after ground-truth seizure onset, and a significant decrease in EBPi was detected 5 s [-42, 74] (median [95% CI]) after ground-truth seizure offset. EBPi demonstrated a positive predictive value of 61.5% [33.3, 75] (median [95% CI]) and a sensitivity of 57.1% [38.5, 66.7] (median [95% CI]) for the detection of ground truth seizure locations. EBPi signals exhibited a temporal sensitivity to seizure events and in some cases were correlated spatially to the seizure location. Therefore, EBPi, which has been linked to CBF, appears to contain spatio-temporal information related to seizure activity and might have useful application in augmenting EEG data captured during seizures.</description>

      <title>Compensating for charge sharing by a deep-learning method: a preliminary experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon counting detectors (PCDs) bring valuable advantages to diagnostic computed tomography (CT), including lower noise and higher resolution than energy integrating detectors. However, there are still several nonideal factors preventing PCDs from meeting people's expectations, for example, charge sharing and pile up. In this paper, we did some preliminary work on charge sharing and conducted an experimental study using an XCounter PCD to compare the effects of no anti-coincidence, anti-coincidence by hardware and charge sharing compensation by a deep learning method. In our results, a smaller bias and standard deviation are obtained from deep learning method than directly from no-anti-coincidence mode of the detector. Our network also outperforms the anti-coincidence mode of the detector in the low energy bin and has smaller standard deviation in the high energy bin. The results validate that a deep learning method is suitable to compensate for charge sharing.</description>

      <title>IQMDose3D: a software tool for reconstructing the dose in patient using patient planning CT images and the signals measured by IQM detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integral quality monitor (IQM) system compares the signal measured with a large volume chamber mounted to the linear accelerator's head to the signal calculated using the patient DICOM RT plan for patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA). A method was developed to reconstruct the dose in patients using the signal measured by IQM chamber and patient planning CT images. A software tool named IQMDose3D was implemented to automate this procedure and integrated into the IQM-based PSQA workflow. IQMDose3D enables the physicists to evaluate PSQA by focusing on the clinical perspective by comparing the delivered plan t the approved clinical plan in terms of the clinical goals, dose-volume histogram (DVH) in addition to the three-dimensional (3D) gamma map and gamma pass rate.</description>

      <title>MR sequence design using digital twins of non-idealized hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process typically happens invisibly to the pulse designer, allowing them to assume the achieved gradient waveform will be as desired. Whilst convenient, this imposes stricter limits on the sequence design than the hardware can handle (for example, pre-emphasis adds an additional overhead to amplifiers). This strategy can be undesirable particularly for lower performance or resource-limited hardware. Instead we explore the use of a 'digital twin' (i.e. an end-to-end model of the scanner system) to optimize control inputs, resulting in sequences that inherently compensate for known imperfections. We explore digital twin optimization specifically for gradient system imperfections as an exemplar. This is first explored in simulations using a simple exponential eddy current model, then experimentally using an empirical gradient impulse response function on a 7T MRI system. When unconstrained, digital twin optimization reproduces classic pre-emphasis. When strict hardware constraints are imposed (simulating lower performance hardware), it identifies novel sequences for scenarios where classic pre-emphasis would be unachievable. Experimentally, the optimization approach was demonstrated to substantially reduce ghosting effects in echo planar images on a 7T system. Digital twin optimization may allow more efficient use of hardware by taking a whole system approach. Ultimately this could enable the use of cheaper hardware without loss of performance.</description>

      <title>Can patient-specific acquisition protocol improve performance on defect detection task in myocardial perfusion SPECT?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial perfusion imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) is a widely used clinical imaging modality for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Current clinical protocols for acquiring and reconstructing MPS images are similar for most patients. However, for patients with outlier anatomical characteristics, such as large breasts, images acquired using conventional protocols are often sub-optimal in quality, leading to degraded diagnostic accuracy. Solutions to improve image quality for these patients outside of increased dose or total acquisition time remain challenging. Thus, there is an important need for new methodologies to improve image quality for such patients. One approach to improving this performance is adapting the image acquisition protocol specific to each patient. For this study, we first designed and implemented a personalized patient-specific protocol-optimization strategy, which we term precision SPECT (PRESPECT). This strategy integrates ideal observer theory with the constraints of tomographic reconstruction to optimize the acquisition time for each projection view, such that MPS defect detection performance is maximized. We performed a clinically realistic simulation study on patients with outlier anatomies on the task of detecting perfusion defects on various realizations of low-dose scans by an anthropomorphic channelized Hotelling observer. Our results show that using PRESPECT led to improved performance on the defect detection task for the considered patients. These results provide evidence that personalization of MPS acquisition protocol has the potential to improve defect detection performance, motivating further research to design optimal patient-specific acquisition and reconstruction protocols for MPS, as well as developing similar approaches for other medical imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised learning towards automated segmentation of PET images with limited annotations: Application to lymphoma patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-consuming task of manual segmentation challenges routine systematic quantification of disease burden. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) hold significant promise to reliably identify locations and boundaries of tumors from PET scans. We aimed to leverage the need for annotated data via semi-supervised approaches, with application to PET images of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). We analyzed 18F-FDG PET images of 292 patients with PMBCL (n=104) and DLBCL (n=188) (n=232 for training and validation, and n=60 for external testing). We employed FCM and MS losses for training a 3D U-Net with different levels of supervision: i) fully supervised methods with labeled FCM (LFCM) as well as Unified focal and Dice loss functions, ii) unsupervised methods with Robust FCM (RFCM) and Mumford-Shah (MS) loss functions, and iii) Semi-supervised methods based on FCM (RFCM+LFCM), as well as MS loss in combination with supervised Dice loss (MS+Dice). Unified loss function yielded higher Dice score (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) (0.73 +/- 0.03; 95% CI, 0.67-0.8) compared to Dice loss (p-value&lt;0.01). Semi-supervised (RFCM+alpha*LFCM) with alpha=0.3 showed the best performance, with a Dice score of 0.69 +/- 0.03 (95% CI, 0.45-0.77) outperforming (MS+alpha*Dice) for any supervision level (any alpha) (p&lt;0.01). The best performer among (MS+alpha*Dice) semi-supervised approaches with alpha=0.2 showed a Dice score of 0.60 +/- 0.08 (95% CI, 0.44-0.76) compared to another supervision level in this semi-supervised approach (p&lt;0.01). Semi-supervised learning via FCM loss (RFCM+alpha*LFCM) showed improved performance compared to supervised approaches. Considering the time-consuming nature of expert manual delineations and intra-observer variabilities, semi-supervised approaches have significant potential for automated segmentation workflows.</description>
