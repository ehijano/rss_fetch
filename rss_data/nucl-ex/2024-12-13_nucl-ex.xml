      <title>Performance of the prototype beam drift chamber for LAMPS at RAON with proton and Carbon-12 beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam Drift Chamber (BDC) is designed to reconstruct the trajectories of incident rare isotope beams provided by RAON (Rare isotope Accelerator complex for ON-line experiments) into the experimental target of LAMPS (Large Acceptance Multi-Purpose Spectrometer). To conduct the performance test of the BDC, the prototype BDC (pBDC) is manufactured and evaluated with the high energy ion beams from HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) facility in Japan. Two kinds of ion beams, 100 MeV proton, and 200 MeV/u $^{12}$C, have been utilized for this evaluation, and the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution have been measured as the function of applied high voltage. This paper introduces the construction details and presents the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution of pBDC.</description>

      <title>Jet substructure of light and heavy flavor jets at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider have been used to constrain parton distribution functions, test perturbative QCD, measure the strong-coupling constant, and probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. We extend these studies to lower energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that would additionally allow us to test existing models of non-perturbative physics. In this study, we present a \pythia-based Monte Carlo study of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The selection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We consider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet angularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of collinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.</description>

      <title>Photo-Induced Quenching of the 229Th Isomer in a Solid-State Host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population dynamics of the 229Th isomeric state is studied in a solid-state host under laser illumination. A photoquenching process is observed, where off-resonant vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation leads to relaxation of the isomeric state. The cross-section for this photoquenching process is measured and a model for the decay process, where photoexcitation of electronic states within the material bandgap opens an internal conversion decay channel, is presented and appears to reproduce the measured cross-section.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we present the directed flow $v_1$ measurements of protons from Xe+Cs(I) collisions at 3.8 AGeV (BM@N run8). We show the datasets, event and track selection cuts, centrality definition, event plane reconstruction and resolution. The $v_1$ results are presented as function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y_{cm}$) for 10-30\% central Xe+Cs(I) collisions. The systematic uncertainty study will also be presented and discussed. The $v_1$ measurements are compared with results of JAM transport model calculations and published data from other experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity, transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of open-heavy flavored hadron production in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV using PYTHIA8</title>

Abstract: Recently, with the upgradation of LHC, it is realized that study of heavy-flavored hadrons, namely $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and $\rm{D}^{0}$ in hadronic collisions, could reveal the possibility of thermalization of charm quarks. With this motivation, we study the production dynamics of these hadrons using a pQCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8 in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The production dynamics of these hadrons are analyzed through charged-particle multiplicity, transverse momentum, and pseudorapidity. With the help of the established PYTHIA8 tunes to mimic the behavior of flow-like features, we investigated the variation of effective temperature and degree of non-extensivity using thermodynamically consistent non-extensive Tsallis statistics. We further attempted to establish a connection between the initial state and final state by estimating the correlation between the number of multi-partonic interactions ($\rm{n}_{MPI}$) with the Knudsen number.</description>

      <title>Modification of Quark-Gluon Distributions in Nuclei by Correlated Nucleon Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis using a factorized nuclear structure model incorporating individual nucleons and pairs of correlated nucleons. Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. Such successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure properties connecting nucleon- and parton-level quantities.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the extraction of physics beyond the Standard Model from electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of electron and positron scattering, including parity violation, offer great promise in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this context it is crucial to understand the corrections which might arise from charge symmetry violation, as well as the less well known strange and charm quark distributions. Our analysis, using state of the art parton distributions, suggests that these contributions lead to corrections in the extraction of the weak couplings $g^{eq}_{AV}$ and $g^{eq}_{VA}$ of the order $(1-2)\%$, while they are as large as $4\%$ for $g^{eq}_{AA}$, at a typical scale of $Q^2 = 10\ {\rm GeV}^2$. These results underline the importance of carrying out high precision measurements, which will not only provide information on physics beyond the Standard Model but also reduce the current uncertainties on our knowledge of the strange and charm quark distributions in the proton.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>
