      <title>Discerning and quantifying high frequency activities in EEG under normal and epileptic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the modifications in the temporal dynamics manifested in the high-frequency EEG spectra of the normal human brain in comparison to the diseased brain undergoing epilepsy. For this purpose, the Fourier reconstruction is efficaciously made use of after Welch's transform, which helped identify the relevant frequency components undergoing significant changes in the case of epilepsy. The temporal dynamics involved in the EEG signals and their associated variations showed a well-structured periodic pattern characterized by bi-stability and significant quantifiable structural changes during epileptic episodes. In particular, we demonstrate and quantify the precise differences in the high-frequency gamma band (40-100 Hz) present in EEG recordings from neurologically normal participants compared to those with epilepsy. The periodic modulations at two dominant frequencies around 50 Hz and 76 Hz in power spectral density are isolated from high frequency noise through the use of Welch's transform, pinpointing their collective behaviors through a phase-space approach. The reconstructed signals from these restricted frequency domains revealed oscillatory motions showing a bi-stability and bi-furcations with distinct differences between normal and seizure conditions. These differences in the phase space images, when analyzed through linear regression and SVM-based machine learning models, support a classification accuracy of around 94-95% between healthy and ictal states using a publicly available EEG dataset from the University of Bonn (Germany). The partial reconstruction of the dynamics as compared to the earlier studies of the full phase space accurately pinpointed the destabilization of the collective high-frequency synchronous behavior and their precise differences in the normal and diseased conditions, avoiding the other chaotic components of the EEG signals.</description>

      <title>Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic nature of iterated map models of population dynamics is justifiable for infinite-sized populations, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible in this limit. However, they are ill-suited for finite-population systems where finite-size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Adding noise to the equations cannot model the demographic noise as it can only represent environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, opening the door to systematic study of extinction risk, quasi-stationarity, and noise-induced transitions.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; nonetheless, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be explored rigorously. This paper introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to grasp the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Behavioral Nuances: Amplifying Non-Obvious Motor Noise Under True Empirical Considerations May Lead to Briefer Assays and Faster Classification Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.</description>

      <title>Spectral fluctuations and crossovers in multilayer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral fluctuations in multilayer networks within the random matrix theory (RMT) framework to characterize universal and non-universal features. The adjacency matrix of a multilayer network exhibits a block structure, with diagonal blocks representing intra-layer connections and off-diagonal blocks encoding inter-layer connections. Applying appropriate scaling factors for these blocks, we equalize variances across inter- and intra-layers, enabling direct comparison of spectral statistics. We analyze eigenvalue spectra across multilayer network configurations with varying inter- and intra-layer connectivities. Introducing a crossover model for bilayer networks, we capture the smooth transition of spectral properties from block-diagonal (two independent GOEs) to single-layer (one GOE) statistics as the relative strength of inter-layer to intra-layer connection varies. Furthermore, we analyze interatomic distance networks derived from protein crystal structures, including 1EWT, 1EWK, and 1UW6, to demonstrate applicability. Our findings reveal that the universality of spectral fluctuations persists across multilayer network architectures and highlight RMT as a robust tool for probing topological and dynamical complexities of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Rare event sampling for moving targets: extremes of temperature and daily precipitation in a general circulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events epitomize high cost: to society through their physical impacts, and to computer servers that are used to simulate them to provide information to mitigate those impacts. It costs hundreds of years to sample a few once-per-century events with straightforward model integration, but that cost can be much reduced with rare event sampling, which nudges ensembles of simulations to convert moderate events to severe ones, e.g., by steering a cyclone directly through a region of interest. With proper statistical accounting, rare event algorithms can provide quantitative climate risk assessment at reduced cost. But this can only work if ensemble members diverge fast enough. Sudden, transient events characteristic of Earth's midlatitude storm track regions, such as heavy precipitation and heat extremes, pose a particular challenge because they come and go faster than an ensemble can explore the possibilities. Here we extend standard rare event algorithms to handle this challenging case in an idealized atmospheric general circulation model, achieving 5-10 times sped-up estimation of long return periods, such as 100-150 years from only 20 years of simulation for extremes of daily precipitation and surface temperature. The algorithm, called TEAMS (``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting''), was developed previously in Finkel and O'Gorman (2024) using a toy chaotic system, and relies on a key parameter -- the advance split time -- which may be estimated based on simple diagnostics of ensemble dispersion rates. The results are promising for accelerated risk assessment across a wide range of physical hazards using more realistic and complex models with acute computational constraints.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos &gt; 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm &gt; 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</description>

      <title>Hemispheric-Specific Coupling Improves Modeling of Functional Connectivity Using Wilson-Cowan Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neural mass models have been widely used to simulate resting-state brain activity from structural connectivity. In this work, we extend a well-established Wilson--Cowan framework by introducing a novel hemispheric-specific coupling scheme that differentiates between intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric structural interactions. We apply this model to empirical cortical connectomes and resting-state fMRI data from matched control and schizophrenia groups. Simulated functional connectivity is computed from the band-limited envelope correlations of regional excitatory activity and compared against empirical functional connectivity matrices. Our results show that incorporating hemispheric asymmetries enhances the correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of anatomically-informed coupling strategies in improving the biological realism of large-scale brain network models.</description>

      <title>Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</description>
