      <title>Modeling the dynamics of aeolian meter-scale bedforms induced by bed heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Desert surfaces are typically non uniform, with individual sand dunes generally surrounded by gravel or non-erodible beds. Similarly, beaches vary in composition and moisture that enhances cohesion between the grains. These bed heterogeneities affect the aeolian transport properties greatly, and can then influence the emergence and dynamics of bedforms. Here, we propose a model that describes how, due to transport capacity being greater on consolidated than erodible beds, patches of sand can grow, migrate and spread to form bedforms with meter-scale length. Our approach has a quantitative agreement with high-resolution spatio-temporal observations, where conventional theory would predict the disappearance of these small bedforms. A crucial component of the model is that the transport capacity does not instantly change from one bed configuration to another. Instead, transport capacity develops over a certain distance, which thereby determines the short-term evolution of the bedform. The model predicts various stages in the development of these meter-scale bedforms, and explains how the evolution of bed elevation profiles observed in the field depends on the duration of the wind event and the intensity of the incoming sand flux. Our study thus sheds light on the initiation and dynamics of early-stage bedforms by establishing links between surface properties, emerging sand patterns and protodunes, commonly observed in coastal and desert landscapes.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation on the Compressive Behavior of Hierarchical Granular Piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical granular piles composed of aggregates are key structural features in both geoscience and planetary science, from fault gouge in seismic zones to the internal structures of comets. Although experimental studies have suggested a multi-step evolution in their packing structure, this hypothesis has lacked numerical validation. In this study, we performed large-scale numerical simulations using the discrete element method to investigate the compressive behavior of hierarchical granular piles. We successfully reproduced and confirmed a three-stage evolution process: (i) rearrangement of the aggregate packing structure, (ii) plastic deformation of small aggregates, and (iii) elastic deformation of constituent particles. Additionally, we developed a semi-analytical model for the compression curve, offering insights into the compressive stages and structural dynamics. Our findings have applications in modeling the internal density profiles of comets and in understanding the early thermal evolution of small icy bodies.</description>

      <title>WHALES: an optimized retracker for satellite radar altimeter waveforms in sea state applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest version of the European Space Agency's Sea State Climate Change Initiative database adopts a dedicated algorithm (retracker) to reprocess two decades of satellite altimetry measurements and provide long time series of significant wave height in the global ocean. This paper describes the main characteristics of this algorithm, called WHALES, and analyzes the impact of algorithm choices on measurement physics, particularly the weighted analysis of residuals in the cost function. Moreover, the impact of WHALES on the sea state database is analyzed in terms of noise reduction and scatter index with in situ data, with a particular focus on the coastal zone, where WHALES primarily improves data quality and quantity compared to previous approaches. We found that valid data records increased by 30% at 5 km from the coast after applying the retracker discussed here.</description>

      <title>GlobalTomo: A global dataset for physics-ML seismic wavefield modeling and FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Goupil: A Monte Carlo engine for the backward transport of low-energy gamma-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goupil is a software library designed for the Monte Carlo transport of low-energy gamma-rays, such as those emitted from radioactive isotopes. The library is distributed as a Python module. It implements a dedicated backward sampling algorithm that is highly effective for geometries where the source size largely exceeds the detector size. When used in conjunction with a conventional Monte Carlo engine (i.e., Geant), the response of a scintillation detector to gamma-active radio-isotopes scattered over the environment is accurately simulated (to the nearest percent) while achieving events rates of a few kHz (with a ~2.3 GHz CPU).</description>
