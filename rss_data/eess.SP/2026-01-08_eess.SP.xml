      <title>SEP Analysis of a Low-Resolution SIMO System with M-PSK over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the average symbol error probability (SEP) of a phase-quantized single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system with M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation is analyzed under Rayleigh fading and additive white Gaussian noise. By leveraging a novel method, we derive exact SEP expressions for a quadrature PSK (QPSK)-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with maximum ratio combining (SIMO-MRC), along with the corresponding high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characterizations in terms of diversity and coding gains. For a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with selection combining, the diversity and coding gains are further obtained for an arbitrary number of receive antennas, complementing existing results. Interestingly, the proposed method also reveals a duality between a SIMO-MRC system and a phase-quantized multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with maximum ratio transmission, when the modulation order, phase-quantization resolution, antenna configuration, and the channel state information (CSI) conditions are reciprocal. This duality enables direct inference to obtain the diversity of a general M-PSK-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO-MRC system, and extends the results to its MISO counterpart. All the above results have been obtained assuming perfect CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Finally, the SEP analysis of a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system is extended to the limited CSIR case, where the CSI at each receive antenna is represented by only 2 bits of channel phase information. In this scenario, the diversity gain is shown to be further halved in general.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Aided Hierarchical Control for Robust RIS-Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) in sixth-generation (6G) networks could shift communication into the near-field communication (NFC) regime. In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Energy Harvesting in High Altitude Platform Station Enabled Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are becoming crucial facilitators for future wireless communication networks, enhancing connectivity across all vertical communication layers, including small Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices, terrestrial users, and aerial devices. In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems.</description>

      <title>Intensity Fluctuation Dynamics in XPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM) constitutes a critical nonlinear impairment in high-capacity Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems, significantly driven by intensity fluctuations (IFs) that evolve due to chromatic dispersion. This paper presents an enhanced XPM model that explicitly incorporates frequency-domain IF growth along the fiber, improving upon prior models that focused primarily on temporal pulse deformation. A direct correlation between this frequency-domain growth and XPM-induced phase distortions is established and analyzed. Results demonstrate that IF evolution, particularly at lower frequencies, profoundly affects XPM phase fluctuation spectra and phase variance. Validated through simulations, the model accurately predicts these spectral characteristics across various system parameters. Furthermore, the derived phase variance enables accurate prediction of system performance in terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER). These findings highlight the necessity of modeling frequency-domain IF evolution to accurately characterize XPM impairments, offering guidance for the design of advanced optical networks.</description>

      <title>OpenISAC: An Open-Source Real-Time Experimentation Platform for OFDM-ISAC with Over-the-Air Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned to be one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. While significant progresses have been achieved for the theoretical studies, the further advancement of ISAC is hampered by the lack of accessible, open-source, and real-time experimental platforms. To address this gap, we introduce OpenISAC, a versatile and high-performance open-source platform for real-time ISAC experimentation. OpenISAC utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform and implements crucial sensing functionalities, including both monostatic and bistatic delay-Doppler sensing. A key feature of our platform is a novel over-the-air (OTA) synchronization mechanism that enables robust bistatic operations without requiring a wired connection between nodes. The platform is built entirely on open-source software, leveraging the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) hardware driver (UHD) library, thus eliminating the need for any commercial licenses. It supports a wide range of software-defined radios, from the cost-effective USRP B200 series to the high-performance X400 series. The physical layer modulator and demodulator are implemented with C++ for high-speed processing, while the sensing data is streamed to a Python environment, providing a user-friendly interface for rapid prototyping and validation of sensing signal processing algorithms. With flexible parameter selection and real-time communication and sensing operation, OpenISAC serves as a powerful and accessible tool for the academic and research communities to explore and innovate within the field of OFDM-ISAC.</description>

      <title>F$^4$-CKM: Learning Channel Knowledge Map with Radio Frequency Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 6G mobile communications, acquiring accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) becomes increasingly challenging due to the growing antenna array size and bandwidth. To alleviate the CSI feedback burden, the channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a promising approach by leveraging environment-aware techniques to predict CSI based solely on user locations. However, how to effectively construct a CKM remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose F$^4$-CKM, a novel CKM construction framework characterized by four distinctive features: radiance Field rendering, spatial-Frequency-awareness, location-Free usage, and Fast learning. Central to our design is the adaptation of radiance field rendering techniques from computer vision to the radio frequency (RF) domain, enabled by a novel Wireless Radiator Representation (WiRARE) network that captures the spatial-frequency characteristics of wireless channels. Additionally, a novel shaping filter module and an angular sampling strategy are introduced to facilitate CKM construction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F$^4$-CKM significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of wireless channel prediction accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS ISAC with Bistatic Sensing via Semi-Blind Atomic Norm Denoising Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) through Zak-transform-based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation is a promising solution for high-mobility scenarios. Realizing accurate bistatic sensing and robust communication necessitates precise channel estimation; however, this remains a formidable challenge in doubly dispersive environments, where fractional delay-Doppler shifts induce severe channel spreading. This paper proposes a semi-blind atomic norm denoising scheme for Zak-OTFS ISAC with bistatic sensing. We first derive the discrete-time input-output (I/O) relationship of Zak-OTFS under fractional delay-Doppler shifts and rectangular windowing. Based on this I/O relation, we formulate the joint channel parameter estimation and data detection task as an atomic norm denoising problem, utilizing the negative square penalty method to handle the non-convex discrete constellation constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we develop an accelerated iterative algorithm that integrates majorization-minimization, accelerated projected gradient, and inexact accelerated proximal gradient methods. We provide a rigorous convergence proof for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves super-resolution sensing accuracy and communication performance approaching the perfect channel state information lower bound.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bound for Angle of Arrival Estimates in True-Time-Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of joint communication and sensing JC&amp;S, the challenge of obtaining accurate parameter estimates is of interest. Parameter estimates, such as the AoA can be utilized for solving the initial access problem, interference mitigation, localization of users or monitoring of the environment and synchronization of MIMO systems. Recently, TTD systems have gained attention for fast beam training during initial access and mitigation of beam squinting. This work derives the CRB for angle estimates in typical TTD systems. Properties of the CRB and the Fisher information are investigated and numerically evaluated. Finally, methods for angle estimation such as ML and established estimators are utilized to solve the angle estimation problem using a uniform linear array.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Multi-beam Training for Multiuser Millimeter-Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study an efficient multi-beam training method for multiuser millimeter-wave communication systems. Unlike the conventional single-beam training method that relies on exhaustive search, multi-beam training design faces a key challenge in balancing the trade-off between beam training overhead and success beam-identification rate, exacerbated by severe inter-beam interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new two-stage multi-beam training method with two distinct multi-beam patterns to enable fast and accurate user angle identification. Specifically, in the first stage, the antenna array is divided into sparse subarrays to generate multiple beams (with high array gains), for identifying candidate user angles. In the second stage, the array is redivided into dense subarrays to generate flexibly steered wide beams, for which a cross-validation method is employed to effectively resolve the remaining angular ambiguity in the first stage. Last, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the success beam-identification rate compared to existing multi-beam training methods, while retaining or even reducing the required beam training overhead.</description>

      <title>CSI-MAE: A Masked Autoencoder-based Channel Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a key technique in machine learning, tackling challenges such as limited labeled data, high annotation costs, and variable wireless channel conditions. It is essential for developing Channel Foundation Models (CFMs), which extract latent features from channel state information (CSI) and adapt to different wireless settings. Yet, existing CFMs have notable drawbacks: heavy reliance on scenario-specific data hinders generalization, they focus on single/dual tasks, and lack zero-shot learning ability. In this paper, we propose CSI-MAE, a generalized CFM leveraging masked autoencoder for cross-scenario generalization. Trained on 3GPP channel model datasets, it integrates sensing and communication via CSI perception and generation, proven effective across diverse tasks. A lightweight decoder finetuning strategy cuts training costs while maintaining competitive performance. Under this approach, CSI-MAE matches or surpasses supervised models. With full-parameter finetuning, it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Its exceptional zero-shot transferability also rivals supervised techniques in cross-scenario applications, driving wireless communication innovation.</description>

      <title>ASVspoof 5: Evaluation of Spoofing, Deepfake, and Adversarial Attack Detection Using Crowdsourced Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges which promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake detection solutions. A significant change from previous challenge editions is a new crowdsourced database collected from a substantially greater number of speakers under diverse recording conditions, and a mix of cutting-edge and legacy generative speech technology. With the new database described elsewhere, we provide in this paper an overview of the ASVspoof 5 challenge results for the submissions of 53 participating teams. While many solutions perform well, performance degrades under adversarial attacks and the application of neural encoding/compression schemes. Together with a review of post-challenge results, we also report a study of calibration in addition to other principal challenges and outline a road-map for the future of ASVspoof.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Downlink Beamforming with Outage Constraints under Imperfect CSI using Model-Driven Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider energy-efficient multi-user hybrid downlink beamforming (BF) and power allocation under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and probabilistic outage constraints. In this domain, classical optimization methods resort to computationally costly conic optimization problems. Meanwhile, generic deep network (DN) architectures lack interpretability and require large training data sets to generalize well. In this paper, we therefore propose a lightweight model-aided deep learning architecture based on a greedy selection algorithm for analog beam codewords. The architecture relies on an instance-adaptive augmentation of the signal model to estimate the impact of the CSI error. To learn the DN parameters, we derive a novel and efficient implicit representation of the nested constrained BF problem and prove sufficient conditions for the existence of the corresponding gradient. In the loss function, we utilize an annealing-based approximation of the outage compared to conventional quantile-based loss terms. This approximation adaptively anneals towards the exact probabilistic constraint depending on the current level of quality of service (QoS) violation. Simulations validate that the proposed DN can achieve the nominal outage level under CSI error due to channel estimation and channel compression, while allocating less power than benchmarks. Thereby, a single trained model generalizes to different numbers of users, QoS requirements and levels of CSI quality. We further show that the adaptive annealing-based loss function can accelerate the training and yield a better power-outage trade-off.</description>

      <title>Discriminating real and synthetic super-resolved audio samples using embedding-based classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution (ADSR), producing perceptually convincing wideband audio from narrowband inputs. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on signal-level or perceptual metrics, leaving open the question of how closely the distributions of synthetic super-resolved and real wideband audio match. Here we address this problem by analyzing the separability of real and super-resolved audio in various embedding spaces. We consider both middle-band ($4\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Planar Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architecture Design Using Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enable programmable control of the wireless propagation environment and are key enablers for future networks. Beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) architectures enhance conventional RIS by interconnecting elements through tunable impedance components, offering greater flexibility with higher circuit complexity. However, excessive interconnections between BD-RIS elements require multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) designs, increasing fabrication difficulty. In this letter, we use graph theory to characterize the BD-RIS architectures that can be realized on double-layer PCBs, denoted as planar-connected RISs. Among the possible planar-connected RISs, we identify the ones with the most degrees of freedom, expected to achieve the best performance under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>Flexible-Duplex Cell-Free Architecture for Secure Uplink Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Expectation Propagation for Distributed Inference in Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grant-free cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (GF-CF-MaMIMO) systems are anticipated to be a key enabling technology for next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, as they support massive connectivity without explicit scheduling. However, the large amount of connected devices prevents the use of orthogonal pilot sequences, resulting in severe pilot contamination (PC) that degrades channel estimation and data detection performance. Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors.</description>

      <title>Solar Panel-based Visible Light Communication for Batteryless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a batteryless wireless communication node for the Internet of Things, powered entirely by ambient light and capable of receiving data through visible light communication. A solar panel serves dual functions as an energy harvester and an optical antenna, capturing modulated signals from LED light sources. A lightweight analog front-end filters and digitizes the signals for an 8-bit low-power processor, which manages the system's operational states based on stored energy levels. The main processor is selectively activated to minimize energy consumption. Data reception is synchronized with the harvester's open-circuit phase, reducing interference and improving signal quality. The prototype reliably decodes 32-bit VLC frames at 800\,Herz, consuming less than 2.8\,mJ, and maintains sleep-mode power below 30\,uW.</description>

      <title>Short-time Fourier Transform-based Signal Recovery for Modulo Analog-to-Digital Converters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a short-time Fourier transform-based method for reconstructing signals encoded using modulo analog-to-digital converters with 1-bit folding information. In contrast to existing Fourier-based reconstruction approaches that require complete access to the entire observation, the proposed technique performs reconstruction over short, overlapping segments, enabling significantly lower latency while preserving the recovery accuracy. We also address the spectral leakage introduced by the windowing operation by selecting window parameters that balance the leakage suppression and the computational complexity of the algorithm. In addition, we establish conditions under which the correct unfolding of the modulo samples is guaranteed, leading to a reconstruction error determined solely by the quantization noise at the output. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method enables modulo analog-to-digital converters to surpass the mean squared error performance of conventional analog-to-digital converters. Furthermore, the proposed recovery method offers improved reconstruction performance compared with higher-order difference-based recovery, particularly in low-resolution and low-sampling rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided for HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Fluid RIS-aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (fRIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed to enhance multi-target sensing and multi-user communication. Unlike the conventional RIS, the fRIS employs movable elements with adjustable positions, offering additional spatial degrees of freedom. In this system, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize sensing beampattern mismatch and symbol estimation error. An algorithm based on alternating minimization is devised to handle the resultant non-convex problem, where the subproblems are solved via augmented Lagrangian method, quadratic programming, semidefinite relaxation, and majorization-minimization. A key challenge is that the element positions affect both incident and reflective channels, leading to the high-order composite objective functions. As a remedy, the high-order terms are transformed into linear and linear-difference forms by exploiting the structural characteristics of fRIS and the channels. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional RIS-aided ISAC and other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Parameter Convergence Radar Detector Based on VAMP Deep Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared with the sparse recovery process in traditional compressed sensing (CS) radar detector CAMP, vector AMP deep unfolding (VAMP-DU) can achieve sparse recovery over a broader range of observation matrices, with faster convergence speed and higher recovery accuracy. However, the distribution of the error term in VAMP-DU remains unknown, which renders the distribution of the test statistic in CS radar detection undetermined and thus hinders threshold setting under a given false alarm rate when VAMP-DU is applied to CS radar detection. In this work, we theoretically prove that the error term in VAMP-DU follows a Gaussian distribution by leveraging a general state evolution (SE). Based on the Gaussianity, we propose a new parameter convergence radar detector (PCRD) as the CS detector to calculate the distribution parameter of the test statistic and realize target detection under a given false alarm rate. Specifically, PCRD exploits the Gaussian property of error term in VAMP-DU to exhibit superior false alarm control capability, while leveraging the improved recovery accuracy of VAMP-DU to further enhance target detection performance. Numerical simulations validate the Gaussianity of the error term in VAMP-DU and show the superiority of the VAMP-DU-based PCRD over existing approaches in both false alarm control accuracy and target detection performance.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted mmWave Systems via Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter addresses the physics-consistent optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and 1-bit-programmable RIS elements. This combination of constraints is typical of current prototypes but unexplored in theoretical work. First, we present a simple statistical generator for multiport-network-theory (MNT) parameters of rich-scattering, RIS-parametrized channels. We account for reciprocity, passivity, and coherent backscattering; then, we add a simple hyper-parameter to control the MC strength. Second, we benchmark model-agnostic (dictionary search, coordinate descent, genetic algorithm) and model-based (temperature-annealed back-propagation) strategies under varying MC, with and without intelligent initialization. Except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with random initialization offers the best trade-off in performance, runtime, and memory. Our insights can guide wireless practitioners who optimize RIS prototypes and other reconfigurable wave systems.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Spread Bounds for Graph Diffusion via Laplacian Regularisation in Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can deviate from a designed starting pattern when the pattern is generated via Laplacian regularisation. Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (with an inverse square-root law). This leads to a design rule: given any target limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming -- where the initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights -- the result applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies the maximum steady-state deviation.</description>

      <title>Multistatic Radar Performance in the Presence of Distributed Wireless Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multistatic radar (MSR) system utilizing a distributed wireless synchronization protocol. The wireless synchronization protocol uses a two-tone waveform exchange for frequency synchronization and a bi-directional waveform exchange for time synchronization, independent of GPS. A Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) framework is developed to quantify the impact of synchronization offsets on joint delay and Doppler estimation, and consequently, on target localization and velocity estimation accuracy. Simulation results derived from the analytical expressions establish the extent to which the residual synchronization offsets degrade the MSR's performance. The performance of the synchronization links primarily depends on the synchronization-link channel and transmit parameters; optimizing these parameters enables the MSR configuration to surpass the monostatic performance and approach the ideal case. Furthermore, the simulated synchronization-link parameters suggest that practical implementation is feasible.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental physical layer conflict in hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) between high-throughput primary communication and the stringent power envelope requirements of passive backscatter sensors. We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments.</description>

      <title>AI-Native 6G Physical Layer with Cross-Module Optimization and Cooperative Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, a framework of AI-native cross-module optimized physical layer with cooperative control agents is proposed, which involves optimization across global AI/ML modules of the physical layer with innovative design of multiple enhancement mechanisms and control strategies. Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of BLER and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3GPP, which hopefully provides valuable insights for future standardization discussions.</description>
