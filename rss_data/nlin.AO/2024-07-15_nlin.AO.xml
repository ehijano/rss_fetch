      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms are capable of swimming through viscous fluids such as water in order to search for nutrients, swim toward oxygen or light, or to escape from predators. To navigate their environment they often perform large nonreciprocal periodic deformations of their shape, by waving appendages such as cilia or flagella, or by deforming their entire body. Even unicellular organisms are fundamentally made of parts, which need to be cooperatively utilized to allow these creatures to navigate their environment, without using a centralized control mechanism. Here, we investigate the physical implications of decentralized decision-making of the actuators of a generalized N-bead Najafi Golestanian microswimmer, self-propelling via coordinated non-reciprocal swimming strokes. We treat each bead as an artificial neural network-based agent that perceives information about its neighbors and whose actions induce strokes of its adjacent arms. With neuroevolution techniques, we evolve optimal policies for the single-bead decision centers such that the N-bead collective efficiently self-propels as an individual, allowing us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies. We demonstrate that such decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and facilitate cargo transport or drug delivery applications "out of the box", without further optimization. Our approach allows us to train large swimmers ($N=100$ and more), and we show that long-wavelength solutions lead to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. Our work is of relevance to understand robust locomotion of biological microswimmers, to develop robust artificial microswimmer navigation strategies, and, in a broader conceptional context, for Artificial Life&lt; and in general emergent levels of individuality.</description>

      <title>Resonant Solitary States in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06483</link>

Abstract: Partially synchronized solitary states occur frequently when a synchronized system of networked oscillators is perturbed locally. Several asymptotic states of different frequencies can coexist at the same node. Here, we reveal the mechanism behind this multistability: additional solitary frequencies arise from the coupling between network modes and the solitary oscillator's frequency, leading to significant energy transfer. This can cause the solitary node's frequency to resonate with a Laplacian eigenvalue. We analyze which network structures enable this resonance and explain longstanding numerical observations. Another solitary state is characterized by the effective decoupling of the synchronized network and the solitary node at the natural frequency. Our framework unifies the description of solitary states near and far from resonance, allowing to predict the behavior of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Approximation of Fading Mode in Neurooscillator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of two delay differential equations with a large parameter, modeling the association of a pair of neurooscillators. The unknown functions describe the changes in the normalized membrane potentials of neurons over time, with the large parameter characterizing the speed of electrical processes. The first equation is separated from the system and represents a generalized Hutchinson equation. This equation, as known, possesses periodic solutions with high peaks over the period. The second equation is also based on the generalized Hutchinson equation, but with an additional term, linking it to an oscillator satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, it is possible to asymptotically construct the so-called fading neuron mode, which is as follows: for any natural number $n$, one can adjust the parameters of the problem in such a way that the solution is asymptotically close to a periodic function with high peaks over $n$ periods, and then, after a transient process represented by decreasing peaks, becomes asymptotically small.</description>
