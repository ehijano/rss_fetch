      <description>arXiv:2408.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kepler potential and its relatives $q\mapsto -\|q\|^{-2(1-1/n)}$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$ in arbitrary dimension $d$. We derive a unique real-analytic symplectic extension of phase space on which the Hamiltonian flow is complete and still real-analytic.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $C^2$ generic hyperbolic Ma\~n\'e sets contain a periodic periodic orbit. In dimension 2, adding a result by Contreras, Figalli, Rifford, which states that $C^2$ generic Ma\~n\'e sets are hyperbolic; we obtain Ma\~n\'e's Conjecture for surfaces in the $C^2$ topology: Given a Tonelli Lagrangian $L$ on a compact surface $M$ there is a $C^2$ open and dense set of functions $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ such that the Ma\~n\'e set of the Lagrangian $L+f$ is a hyperbolic periodic orbit.</description>

      <title>Application of Superconducting Technology in the Electricity Industry: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Government Subsidy Policies and Power Company Equipment Upgrade Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of "LK-99," a novel material developed by a Korean research team, on the power equipment industry. Using evolutionary game theory, the interactions between governmental subsidies and technology adoption by power companies are modeled. A key innovation of this research is the introduction of sensitivity analyses concerning time delays and initial subsidy amounts, which significantly influence the strategic decisions of both government and corporate entities. The findings indicate that these factors are critical in determining the rate of technology adoption and the efficiency of the market as a whole. Due to existing data limitations, the study offers a broad overview of likely trends and recommends the inclusion of real-world data for more precise modeling once the material demonstrates room-temperature superconducting characteristics. The research contributes foundational insights valuable for future policy design and has significant implications for advancing the understanding of technology adoption and market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of synchronous tridiagonal network motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a network of identical agents, coupled through linear asymmetric coupling. An important case is when each agent has an asymptotically stable periodic orbit, so that the full network inherits a synchronous periodic orbit, but also chaotic trajectories are of interest. In this work, we will restrict to "nearest-neighbor" type of couplings.
  The Master Stability Function (MSF) is a powerful tool to establish local stability of the synchronous orbit, in particular a negative MSF implies asymptotic stability. But not every network structure gives a negative MSF. Moreover, there are many situations where in order to obtain a negative MSF, symmetric networks need a coupling strength so large, that the model bears little physical interest. We make two main contributions: (i) Given a tridiagonal nearest neighbor topology, we show how it is possible to choose appropriate coupling so that the synchronous orbit is stable, and (ii) we show that this stability comes without the need of a large coupling strength if the structure is not symmetric. Our construction is based on solving inverse eigenvalue problems. We will see that the coupling of the agents cannot always be chosen to be symmetric so that the underlying graph structure is that of a directed graph with edges having different weights. We provide numerical implementation of our technique on networks of van der Pol and of chaotic R\"ossler oscillators, where the standard symmetric nearest neighbor coupling fails to give stability of the synchronous orbit.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Families of Gibbs Measures and their Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For H\"older continuous functions $f_i$, $i=0,\ldots ,d$, on a subshift of finite type and $\Theta\subset \mathbb \R^d$ we consider a parametrized family of potentials $\{F_\theta= f_0+\sum_{i=1}^d \theta_i f_i : \theta\in \Theta\}$. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$ for a family of Gibbs measures with potentials $F_\theta$ is consistent and determine its asymptotic distribution under the associated shift-invariant distribution. A second part discusses applications; from confidence intervals through testing problems to connections to Bernoulli distributions and stationary Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Finite Dynamical Laminations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed several combinatorial notions about these laminations some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We introduce the pullback tree, and show that all FDL have a child in it. This gives a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations have very nice properties. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides a summary of the combinatorial information we provide about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>Determining Modes, Synchronization, and Intertwinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the interrelation between the determining modes property in the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) of incompressible fluids and the synchronization property of two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation applied to the 2D NSE. These two properties are realized as manifestations of a more general phenomenon of "self-synchronous intertwinement". It is shown that this concept is a logically stronger form of asymptotic enslavement, as characterized by the existence of finitely many determining modes in the 2D NSE. In particular, this stronger form is shown to imply convergence of the synchronization filter and the nudging filter from continuous data assimilation (CDA), and then subsequently invoked to show that convergence in these filters implies that the 2D NSE possesses finitely many determining modes. The main achievement of this article is to therefore identify a new concept, that of self-synchronous intertwinement, through which a rigorous relationship between the determining modes property and synchronization in these CDA filters is established and made decisively clear. The theoretical results are then complemented by numerical experiments that confirm the conclusions of the theorems.</description>

      <title>One dimensional energy cascades in a fractional quasilinear NLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>Entropy of group actions beyond uniform lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy of measure preserving or continuous actions of amenable discrete groups allows for various equivalent approaches. Among them are the ones given by the techniques developed by Ollagnier and Pinchon on the one hand and the Ornstein-Weiss lemma on the other. We extend these two approaches to the context of actions of amenable topological groups. In contrast to the discrete setting, our results reveal a remarkable difference between the two concepts of entropy in the realm of non-discrete groups: while the first quantity collapses to 0 in the non-discrete case, the second yields a well-behaved invariant for amenable unimodular groups. Concerning the latter, we moreover study the corresponding notion of topological pressure, prove a Goodwyn-type theorem, and establish the equivalence with the uniform lattice approach (for locally compact groups admitting a uniform lattice). Our study elaborates on a version of the Ornstein-Weiss lemma due to Gromov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In connection with the results of Tim Austin, and Wen Huang, Song Shao, Xiangdong Ye we present the following assertion: there are infinite automorphisms $S,T$, some set $A$ of positive finite measure and a sequence $N_m$ with $|N_{m+1}|/|N_m|\ \to\infty$ such that $T^iA\cap S^iA=\phi$ for $i\in [N_{4k}, N_{4k+1}]$ and $T^iA=S^iA$ for $i\in [N_{4k+2}, N_{2k+3}]$. For the corresponding deterministic Gaussian and Poisson suspensions $S_\circ,T_\circ$ over $S,T$ for some $f\in L_\infty$ there is no limit of $ \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N T_\circ^nf\,S_\circ^nf$ in $ L_2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>

      <title>Linear System Analysis and Optimal Control of Natural Gas Dynamics in Pipeline Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine nonlinear and adaptive linear control systems that model compressor-actuated dynamics of natural gas flow in pipeline networks. A model-predictive controller (MPC) is developed for feedback control of compressor actions in which the internal optimization over the local time horizon is constrained by the dynamics of either the nonlinear system or the adaptive linear system. Stability of the local linear system is established and a rigorous bound on the error between the solutions of the nonlinear and linear systems is derived and used to devise situations when the linear MPC may be used instead of the nonlinear MPC without a significant difference between their respective predictions. We use several test networks to compare the performances of various controllers that involve nonlinear and adaptive linear models as well as moving-horizon and single-interval optimization. Our results demonstrate that the proposed moving-horizon MPC is well-equipped to adapt in local time to changes in system parameters and has the ability to reduce total computational costs by orders of magnitude relative to conventional transient optimization methods.</description>

      <title>P53 Orchestrates Cancer Metabolism: Unveiling Strategies to Reverse the Warburg Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer cells exhibit significant alterations in their metabolism, characterised by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and an increased reliance on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift, known as the Warburg effect, is pivotal in fuelling cancer's uncontrolled growth, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. While dysregulation of many genes contributes to this metabolic shift, the tumour suppressor gene p53 emerges as a master player. Yet, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study introduces a comprehensive mathematical model, integrating essential p53 targets, offering insights into how p53 orchestrates its targets to redirect cancer metabolism towards an OXPHOS-dominant state. Simulation outcomes align closely with experimental data comparing glucose metabolism in colon cancer cells with wild-type and mutated p53. Additionally, our findings reveal the dynamic capability of elevated p53 activation to fully reverse the Warburg effect, highlighting the significance of its activity levels not just in triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death) post-chemotherapy but also in modifying the metabolic pathways implicated in treatment resistance. In scenarios of p53 mutations, our analysis suggests targeting glycolysis-instigating signalling pathways as an alternative strategy, whereas targeting solely synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) does support mitochondrial respiration but may not effectively suppress the glycolysis pathway, potentially boosting the energy production and cancer cell viability.</description>
