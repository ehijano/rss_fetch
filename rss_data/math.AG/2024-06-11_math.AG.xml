      <title>Equivariant vector bundles on toric schemes over semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of equivariant vector bundles on schemes over semirings. We do this by considering the functor of points of a locally free sheaf. We prove that every toric vector bundle on a toric scheme $X$ over an idempotent semifield equivariantly splits as a sum of toric line bundles. We then study the equivariant Picard group $\text{Pic}_G(X)$. Finally, we prove a version of Klyachko's classification theorem for toric vector bundles over an idempotent semifield.</description>

      <title>On symmetric plane quartic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the geometry of plane quartics with large automorphism groups. We show results devoted to smooth plane quartics that are invariant under the action of the elementary abelian group of type $[2,2,2]$, and we study geometric properties of the smooth plane quartic having automorphism group of order $48$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the non-vanishing conjecture for cotangent bundles on isotrivial elliptic surfaces. Combined with the result by H\"{o}ring and Peternell, it completely solves the question for surfaces with Kodaira dimension at most $1$.</description>

Abstract: For a large class of cohomology theories, we prove that refined unramified cohomology is canonically isomorphic to the hypercohomology of a natural truncated complex of Zariski sheaves.

      <description>arXiv:2406.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that even dimensional Fermat cubic hypersurfaces are rational over any field of characteristic different from three. As a byproduct of our rationality constructions we get estimates on the number of their rational points over a number field, and a class of quadro-cubic Cremona correspondences of even dimensional projective spaces.</description>

      <title>The effective cone conjecture for Calabi--Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an {\it effective cone conjecture} for klt Calabi--Yau pairs $(X,\Delta)$, pertaining to the structure of the cone of effective divisors $\mathrm{Eff}(X)$ modulo the action of the subgroup of pseudo-automorphisms $\mathrm{PsAut}(X,\Delta)$. Assuming the existence of good minimal models in dimension $\dim(X)$, known to hold in dimension up to $3$, we prove that the effective cone conjecture for $(X,\Delta)$ is equivalent to the Kawamata--Morrison--Totaro movable cone conjecture for $(X,\Delta)$. As an application, we show that the movable cone conjecture unconditionally holds for the smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds introduced by Schoen and studied by Namikawa, Grassi and Morrison. We also show that for such a Calabi--Yau threefold $X$, all of its minimal models, apart from $X$ itself, have rational polyhedral nef cones.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of points on an intersection of a cubic threefold and a non-degenerate Hermitian threefold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Edoukou in 2008 that a non-degenerate Hermitian threefold in $\mathbb{P}^4 (\mathbb{F}_{q^2})$ has at most $d(q^5+q^2) + q^3 + 1$ points in common with a threefold of degree $d$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. He proved the conjecture for $d=2$. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for $d = 3$ and $q \ge 7$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on second and third weights of Projective Reed-Muller codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the weight distributions of the projective Reed-Muller codes is a very hard problem and has been studied extensively in the literature. In this article, we provide an alternative proof of the second weight of the projective Reed-Muller codes $\PRM (d, m)$ where $m \ge 3$ and $3 \le d \le \frac{q+3}{2}$. We show that the second weight is attained by codewords that correspond to hypersurfaces containing a hyperplane under the hypothesis on $d$. Furthermore, we compute the second weight of $\PRM (d, 2)$ for $3 \le d \le q-1$. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the third weight of $\PRM(d, 2)$.</description>

      <title>The Tannaka group $E_6$ only arises from cubic threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under mild assumptions, the Fano surfaces of lines on smooth cubic threefolds are the only smooth subvarieties of abelian varieties whose Tannaka group for the convolution of perverse sheaves is an exceptional simple group. This in particular leads to a considerable strengthening of our previous work on the Shafarevich conjecture. A key idea is to control the Hodge decomposition on cohomology by a cocharacter of the Tannaka group of Hodge modules, and to play this off against an improvement of the Hodge number estimates for irregular varieties by Lazarsfeld-Popa and Lombardi.</description>

      <title>Adic curves: stable reduction, skeletons and metric structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of adic curves over an affinoid field of arbitrary rank. In particular, quite analogously to Berkovich geometry we classify points on curves, prove a semistable reduction theorem in the version of Ducros' triangulations, define associated curve skeletons and prove that they are deformational retracts in a suitable sense. An important new technical tool is an appropriate compactification of ordered groups that we call the ranger compactification. Intervals of rangers are then used to define metric structures and construct deformational retractions.</description>

      <title>The geometry of polynomial representations in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\mathbf{GL}$-variety is a (typically infinite dimensional) variety modeled on the polynomial representation theory of the general linear group. In previous work, we studied these varieties in characteristic 0. In this paper, we obtain results in positive characteristic: for example, we prove a version of Chevalley's theorem on constructible sets. We give an application of our theory to strength of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Hodge structures on conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of complex Hodge structures on modular functors, under the assumptions that their conformal blocks are semisimple as representations of mapping class groups and that the associated categories are ribbon. These $2$ assumptions are satisfied by modular functors coming from Lie algebras, and it is an open conjecture that they are always satisfied. The proof is based on the non-abelian Hodge correspondence and Ocneanu rigidity. Given a modular functor, we explain how its Hodge numbers fit into a Frobenius algebra and the Chern characters of its Hodge decompositions into a new cohomological field theory (CohFT). In the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ modular functors of level $2$ times an odd number, we give explicit formulas for all Hodge numbers, in any genus $g$.</description>

      <title>Categories of Line Defects and Cohomological Hall Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an "algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. As we vary the choice of vacuum, we expect the collection of functors associated to any given theory to capture the full information of the original monoidal category of lines.</description>

      <title>Odd and Even Elliptic Curves with Complex Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an order $O$ in a quadratic field $K$ odd (resp. even) if its discriminant is an odd (resp. even) integer. We call an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $C$ of complex numbers with CM odd (resp. even) if its endomorphism ring $End(E)$ is an odd (resp. even) order in the corresponding imaginary quadratic field.
  Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties.
  1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$;
  2) $j(E')$ is a real number;
  3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$.
  We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even).
  This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a tropical univariate polynomial $f$ we define its tropical Hilbert function as the dimension of a tropical linear prevariety of solutions of the tropical Macauley matrix of the polynomial up to a (growing) degree. We show that the tropical Hilbert function equals (for sufficiently large degrees) a sum of a linear function and a periodic function with an integer period. The leading coefficient of the linear function coincides with the tropical entropy of $f$. Also we establish sharp bounds on the tropical entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture of Voisin states that two points on a smooth projective complex variety whose algebra of holomorphic forms is generated in degree 2 are rationally equivalent to each other if and only if their difference lies in the third step of the Bloch-Beilinson filtration. In this note, we formulate a generalization that allows for rational equivalence of effective zero-cycles of higher degree, at the expense of looking deeper in the Bloch-Beilinson filtration. In the first half, we provide evidence in support of this conjecture in the case of abelian varieties and projective hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. Notably, we give explicit criteria for rational equivalence of effective zero-cycles on moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on K3 surfaces, generalizing that of Marian-Zhao. In the second half, in an effort to explain our main conjecture, we formulate a second conjecture predicting when the diagonal of a smooth projective variety belongs to a subalgebra of the ring of correspondences generated in low degree.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic, cusp and cone boundary components. We compute the volumes in some new cases, in particular when there exists a large cone angle. This allows us to give geometric meaning to Mirzakhani's polynomials under substitution of imaginary valued boundary lengths, corresponding to hyperbolic cone angles, and to study the behaviour of the volume under the $2\pi$ limit of a cone angle.</description>

      <title>Embedded $\mathbb{Q}$-desingularization of real Schubert varieties and application to the relative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraicity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algebraic set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of dimension $d$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic set if it can be described, both globally and locally, by polynomial equations with rational coefficients. Set $m:=\max\{n,2d+1\}$, if $V$ is compact, or $m:=n+2d+3$, otherwise. We prove that every nonsingular real algebraic set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with nonsingular algebraic subsets $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ in general position is Nash diffeomorphic to a $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic set $V'\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic subsets $\{V'_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ in general position and the Nash diffeomorphism $h:V\to V'$ sends each $V_i$ to $V_i'$. As a byproduct we obtain a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relative version of Nash-Tognoli theorem for compact manifolds. A key result in the proof is the description of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-homological cycles of real Grassmannian manifolds by $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic representatives via the Bott-Samelson resolution of real embedded Schubert varieties.</description>

Abstract: Tautological bundles of realizations of matroids were introduced in [BEST23] as a unifying geometric model for studying matroids. We compute the cohomologies of exterior and symmetric powers of these vector bundles, and show that they depend only on the matroid of the realization. As an application, we show that the log canonical bundle of a wonderful compactification of a hyperplane arrangement complement, in particular the moduli space of pointed rational curves, has vanishing higher cohomologies.</description>

      <title>The Chow ring of the moduli space of degree $2$ quasi-polarized K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Chow ring with rational coefficients of the moduli space $\mathcal F_{2}$ of quasi-polarized $K3$ surfaces of degree $2$. We find generators, relations, and calculate the Chow Betti numbers. The highest nonvanishing Chow group is $\mathsf A^{17}(\mathcal F_2)\cong {\mathbb{Q}}$. We prove that the Chow ring consists of tautological classes and is isomorphic to the even cohomology. The Chow ring is not generated by divisors and does not satisfy duality with respect to the pairing into $\mathsf A^{17}(\mathcal F_2)$. The kernel of the pairing is a 1-dimensional subspace of $\mathsf{A}^{9}(\mathcal F_2)$ which we calculate explicitly. In the appendix, we revisit Kirwan-Lee's calculation of the Poincar\'e polynomial of $\mathcal{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>The algebraic degree of sparse polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a broad class of polynomial optimization problems whose constraints and objective functions exhibit sparsity patterns. We give two characterizations of the number of critical points to these problems, one as a mixed volume and one as an intersection product on a toric variety. As a corollary, we obtain a convex geometric interpretation of polar degrees, a classical invariant of algebraic varieties, as well as Euclidean distance degrees. Furthermore, we prove the BKK generality of Lagrange systems in many instances.</description>

      <title>Broken Toric Varieties and Cell-Compatible Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of broken toric varieties via the derived push-forward of the constant sheaf to a complex of polytopes, proving a Deligne-type decomposition theorem, degeneration of the associated Leray-Serre spectral sequence, and showing that the Leray filtration on their cohomology is equal to twice the weight filtration. Furthermore, we give an explicit formula for the Betti numbers of some broken toric varieties whose associated complex of polytopes is the $n$-skeleton of a higher dimensional polytope, encompassing some important examples.</description>

      <title>Gersten-type conjecture for henselian local rings of normal crossing varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 0$ be an integer. For a normal crossing variety $Y$ over the spectrum of a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p&gt;0$, K.Sato defined an \'{e}tale logarithmic Hodge-Witt sheaf $\lambda^{n}_{Y, r}$ on the \'{e}tale site $Y_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}$ which agrees with $W_{r}\Omega^{n}_{Y, \log}$ in the case where $Y$ is smooth over $\operatorname{Spec}(k)$. In this paper, we prove the Gersten-type conjecture for $\lambda^{n}_{r}$ over the henselization of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}$ of $Y$ at a point $y\in Y$. As an application, we prove the relative version of the Gersten-type conjecture for the $p$-adic \'{e}tale Tate twist $\mathfrak{T}_{1}(n)$ over the henselization of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{X}, x}$ of a semistable family $\mathfrak{X}$ over the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring $B$ of mixed characteristic $(0, p)$ at a point $x\in \mathfrak{X}$ in the case where $B$ contains $p$-th roots of unity. Moreover, we prove a generalization of Artin's theorem about the Brauer groups.</description>

      <title>Tjurina spectrum and Hertling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture of Q. Shi, Y. Wang and H. Zuo claiming that the maximal spectral number of a hypersurface isolated singularity does not belong to the Tjurina spectrum. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, which is compatible with the action of $f$ and also with the $V$-filtration. We also provide a sufficient condition for the generalized Hertling conjecture on the variance of Tjurina spectrum to fail, and calculate some examples using some codes in Singular.</description>

      <title>Estimating Gaussian mixtures using sparse polynomial moment systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method of moments is a classical statistical technique for density estimation that solves a system of moment equations to estimate the parameters of an unknown distribution. A fundamental question critical to understanding identifiability asks how many moment equations are needed to get finitely many solutions and how many solutions there are. We answer this question for classes of Gaussian mixture models using the tools of polyhedral geometry. In addition, we show that a generic Gaussian $k$-mixture model is identifiable from its first $3k+2$ moments. Using these results, we present a homotopy algorithm that performs parameter recovery for high dimensional Gaussian mixture models where the number of paths tracked scales linearly in the dimension.</description>

      <title>One-form symmetries and the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A$-model: Topologically twisted indices for any $G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $SU(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_r \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N$ subgroups of the center of the gauge group, and with the associated $\mathbb{Z}_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on, reproducing and extending various results in the literature. In particular, we find an interesting mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb{Z}_r$ one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)_K$ theory (for $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even). This plays a key role in our derivation of the Witten index, which we explicitly compute for any $N$, $K$ and $r$ in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>
