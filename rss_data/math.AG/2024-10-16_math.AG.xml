      <title>On the structure of equivariant derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note, we discuss some results of the author on the structure of derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves and the derived categories of geometric invariant theory quotients. We take a recent perspective, emphasizing the theory of restricted local cohomology. We also discuss several applications and concrete examples: studying the effects of birational modification on derived categories, constructing categorical completions of equivariant derived categories, and constructing actions of generalized braid groups on derived categories of GIT quotients. This is a contribution to the proceedings of the International Congress of Basic Science, held in July 2024.</description>

      <title>Generic Vanishing for Singular Varieties via Du Bois complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove appropriate generic vanishing theorems for singular varieties, generalizing the well-known generic vanishing theorem by Green and Lazarsfeld in [GL87] and the generic vanishing theorem of Nakano type in [PS13]. Our theorem explains the counterexample of Hacon and Kov\'acs in [HK15].</description>

      <title>Adinkra height functions and the Jacobian of a generalized Fermat curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</description>

      <title>On the coefficients of the Zeta-function's L-polynomial for algebraic function fields over finite constant fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit formula of the coefficients of the Zeta-Function's L-polynomial for algebraic function fields over finite constant fields. Thus, we deduce an expression of the class number of algebraic function fields defined over finite fields. Moreover, we give an application of this formula in the case of the curves of defect 2 defined over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Integral Identity via Braden's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide a very short proof of a generalized categorified version, within the motivic stable homotopy category of Morel and Voevodsky, of the integral identity for virtual motives conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Our proof is an application of an important result in geometric representation theory due to Braden and known as the hyperbolic localization/restriction theorem. Though originally proved in the context of etale sheaves (or sheaves on the associated complex analytic space in the case of complex algebraic varieties) Braden's theorem turns out to hold also in the context of motivic sheaves, at least in the special case of vector bundles with a linear G_m-action.</description>

      <title>A new hierarchy for complex plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the type of a plane curve using the sum of the first two exponents arising from the minimal free resolution of its Jacobian algebra. Then we show that this invariant behaves well with respect to the union of curves. The curves of type $0$ are precisely the free curves and the curves of type $1$ are the plus-one generated curves. In this note we study the properties of the curves of type $2$ and construct families of line arrangements and conic-line arrangements of this type.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Discriminants of Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <title>Symplectic cuts and open/closed strings II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>MoonMetaSync: Lunar Image Registration Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares scale-invariant (SIFT) and scale-variant (ORB) feature detection methods, alongside our novel feature detector, IntFeat, specifically applied to lunar imagery. We evaluate these methods using low (128x128) and high-resolution (1024x1024) lunar image patches, providing insights into their performance across scales in challenging extraterrestrial environments. IntFeat combines high-level features from SIFT and low-level features from ORB into a single vector space for robust lunar image registration. We introduce SyncVision, a Python package that compares lunar images using various registration methods, including SIFT, ORB, and IntFeat. Our analysis includes upscaling low-resolution lunar images using bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolation, offering a unique perspective on registration effectiveness across scales and feature detectors in lunar landscapes. This research contributes to computer vision and planetary science by comparing feature detection methods for lunar imagery and introducing a versatile tool for lunar image registration and evaluation, with implications for multi-resolution image analysis in space exploration applications.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing Principal Minors of Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the image of the cone of positive definite matrices under the principal minors map. It is a polyhedral subset of the set of $M$-concave functions on the discrete $n$-dimensional cube. We show it coincides with the intersection of the affine tropical flag variety with the submodular cone. In particular, any cell in the regular subdivision of the cube induced by a point in this tropicalization can be subdivided into base polytopes of realizable matroids. We also use this tropicalization as a guide to discover new algebraic inequalities among the principal minors of positive definite matrices of a fixed size.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau metrics through Grassmannian learning and Donaldson's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the problem of numerical K\"ahler metrics, we survey machine learning techniques in this area, discussing both advantages and drawbacks. We then revisit the algebraic ansatz pioneered by Donaldson. Inspired by his work, we present a novel approach to obtaining Ricci-flat approximations to K\"ahler metrics, applying machine learning within a `principled' framework. In particular, we use gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold to identify an efficient subspace of sections for calculation of the metric. We combine this approach with both Donaldson's algorithm and learning on the $h$-matrix itself (the latter method being equivalent to gradient descent on the fibre bundle of Hermitian metrics on the tautological bundle over the Grassmannian). We implement our methods on the Dwork family of threefolds, commenting on the behaviour at different points in moduli space. In particular, we observe the emergence of nontrivial local minima as the moduli parameter is increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, the residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Grassmannians, Lusztig's notion of total positivity coincides with positivity of the Plucker coordinates. This coincidence underpins the rich interaction between matroid theory, tropical geometry, and the theory of total positivity. Bloch and Karp furthermore characterized the (type A) partial flag varieties for which the two notions positivity similarly coincide. We characterize the symplectic (type C) and odd-orthogonal (type B) partial flag varieties for which Lusztig's total positivity coincides with Plucker positivity.</description>

      <title>Super Weil-Petersson measures on the moduli space of curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The super Weil-Petersson metric defined over the moduli space of smooth super curves produces a natural measure over the moduli space of smooth curves. The construction of the measure uses the extra data of a spin structure on each smooth curve. When we allow marked points, the construction produces a collection of measures indexed by the behaviour of the spin structure at marked points -- Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond. In this paper we define these measures, and prove that they are finite. Each total measure gives the super volume of the moduli space of super curves with marked points. The Neveu-Schwarz volumes are polynomials that satisfy a recursion relation discovered by Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion relations between Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces. We prove here that the Ramond boundary behaviour produces deformations of the Neveu-Schwarz volume polynomials, satisfying a variant of the Stanford-Witten recursion relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $Y$ is a smooth variety equipped with a top form. We prove a simple theorem giving a sharp lower bound on the geometric genus of a family of subvarieties of $Y$, in terms of the dimension of this family. Two elementary applications are presented. On the one hand, we show that for a very general curve $C$ and a very general hypersurface $Y\subset \mathbb P^{n+1}$ of degree $\ge 2n+1$, any map $C \to Y$ is constant. On the other hand, we give a lower bound on the genus of a family of curves with an isotrivial factor in the associated family of Jacobians; we also characterize the families of curves attaining this bound as the families of degree $2$ branched covers of a fixed curve.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every indefinite quadratic form with non-negative integer coefficients is the volume polynomial of a pair of lattice polygons. This solves the discrete version of the Heine-Shephard problem for two bodies in the plane. As an application, we show how to construct a pair of planar tropical curves (or a pair of divisors on a toric surface) with given intersection number and self-intersection numbers.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of Some Quot Schemes on Nodal Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an integral projective nodal curve over $\mathbb C$, of arithmetic genus $g \geqslant 2$. Let $E$ be a vector bundle on $C$ of rank $r$ and degree $e$. Let $\textrm{Quot}_{C/\mathbb C}(E,k,d)$ denote the Quot scheme of quotients of $E$ of rank $k$ and degree $d$. We show that $\textrm{Quot}_{C/\mathbb C}(E,k,d)$ is irreducible for $d \gg 0$.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Brill-Noether Loci and Moduli for Very Ample Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Brill-Noether loci for higher dimensional varieties. Let $M$ be a moduli space of coherent sheaves on $X$. The Brill-Noether loci of $M$ are the closed subsets $\{\mathcal{F} \in M : h^0(X,\mathcal{F}) \geq k+1\}$. When $X$ is a smooth curve and $M = \textbf{Pic}_X^d$, the space of degree $d$ line bundles on $X$, the Brill-Noether loci have a natural determinantal scheme structure coming from a map of vector bundles on $\textbf{Pic}_X^d$, which is the main tool in studying their geometry. In [CMR10], the authors generalize this to the case where $X$ is any variety and $M$ is the moduli space of stable vector bundles on $X$ with fixed invariants but require that $H^i(X,E) = 0$ for all $E \in M$ and $i \geq 2$. We generalize these results by showing how to give a natural determinantal scheme structure to the Brill-Noether loci for any $X$ and any $M$. In doing so we develop the theory of Fitting ideals for a complex which can be used to define natural scheme structures in other cases as well, such as the locus of points where the projective dimension of a coherent sheaf jumps up. As an application of our results, we construct moduli spaces for very ample line bundles on a variety.</description>

      <title>A stacky $p$-adic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence on Hitchin-small locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an algebraically closed perfectoid field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with the ring of integer $\mathcal{O}_C$ and the infinitesimal thickening $\Ainf$. Let $\mathfrak X$ be a semi-stable formal scheme over $\mathcal{O}_C$ with a fixed flat lifting $\widetilde{\mathfrak X}$ over $\Ainf$. Let $X$ be the generic fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ and $\widetilde X$ be its lifting over $\BdRp$ induced by $\widetilde{\mathfrak X}$. Let $\MIC_r(\widetilde X)^{{\rm H}\text{-small}}$ and $\rL\rS_r(X,\BBdRp)^{{\rm H}\text{-small}}$ be the $v$-stacks of rank-$r$ Hitchin-small integrable connections on $X_{\et}$ and $\BBdRp$-local systems on $X_{v}$, respectively. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between this two stacks by introducing a new period sheaf with connection $(\calO\bB_{\dR,\pd}^+,\rd)$ on $X_{v}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of F-cohomological field theories and F-topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define F-topological recursion (F-TR) as a non-symmetric version of topological recursion, which associates a vector potential to some initial data. We describe the symmetries of the initial data for F-TR and show that, at the level of the vector potential, they include the F-Givental (non-linear) symmetries studied by Arsie, Buryak, Lorenzoni, and Rossi within the framework of F-manifolds. Additionally, we propose a spectral curve formulation of F-topological recursion. This allows us to extend the correspondence between semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs) and topological recursion, as established by Dunin-Barkowski, Orantin, Shadrin, and Spitz, to the F-world. In the absence of a full reconstruction theorem \`a la Teleman for F-CohFTs, this demonstrates that F-TR holds for the ancestor vector potential of a given F-CohFT if and only if it holds for some F-CohFT in its F-Givental orbit. We turn this into a useful statement by showing that the correlation functions of F-topological field theories (F-CohFTs of cohomological degree 0) are governed by F-TR. We apply these results to the extended 2-spin F-CohFT. Furthermore, we exhibit a large set of linear symmetries of F-CohFTs, which do not commute with the F-Givental action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct integral models of Shimura varieties of abelian type with parahoric level structure over odd primes. These models are \'etale locally isomorphic to corresponding local models.</description>
