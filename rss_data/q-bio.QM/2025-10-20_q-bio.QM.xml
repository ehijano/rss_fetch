      <title>Navigating the consequences of mechanical ventilation in clinical intensive care settings through an evolutionary game-theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Hematological Malignancy Prediction from Peripheral Blood Smears in a Real-World Cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model, trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from 6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495 healthy controls, eight coarse classes. cAItomorph leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It achieves an overall accuracy of 0.72 in eight disease classification, with F1 scores of 0.76 for acute leukemia, 0.80 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.94 for healthy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 0.87 in top-2 predictions. cAItomorph achieves high sensitivity for acute leukemia cases in external test sets. By analyzing attention heads, we demonstrate clinically relevant cell-level attentions in both internal and external test sets. Moreover, our model's calibrated prediction probabilities reduce the false discovery rate from 13.5% to 8.7% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations based on peripheral blood smears. This study highlights the potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies, illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.</description>

      <title>Random Measures, ANOVA Models and Quantifying Uncertainty in Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel approach to global sensitivity analysis, grounded in the variance-covariance structure of random variables derived from random measures. The proposed methodology facilitates the application of information-theoretic rules for uncertainty quantification, offering several advantages. Specifically, the approach provides valuable insights into the decomposition of variance within discrete subspaces, similar to the standard ANOVA analysis. To illustrate this point, the method is applied to datasets obtained from the analysis of randomized controlled trials on evaluating the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and assessing clinical endpoints in a lung cancer study.</description>

      <title>Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed- form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional- hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining a physics- based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems</description>
