      <title>Disentanglement as a strong cosmic censor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If entanglement builds spacetime, then conversely, disentanglement ought to destroy spacetime. From the quantum null energy condition and quantum focusing conjecture, we obtain disentanglement criteria which necessitate infinite energies and strong spacetime singularities. We apply our results to the strong cosmic censorship proposal, where strong singularities at the Cauchy horizons in black holes are desirable. Using our disentanglement criteria and without resorting to any detailed calculations, we provide an exceedingly general and physically transparent discussion of strong cosmic censorship in semiclassical black holes. We argue that strong cosmic censorship is enforced in asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes by disentanglement and describe how similar disentanglement might be avoided in some anti-de Sitter cases.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Flux Tube S-matrix Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of branon jets, states of collinear flux tube excitations. We argue for the analyticity, crossing and unitarity of the multi-particle scattering of these jets and, through the S-matrix bootstrap, place bounds on a set of finite energy multi-particle sum rules. Such bounds define a matrioska of sorts with a smaller and smaller allowed regions as we impose more constraints. The Yang-Mills flux tube, as well as other interesting flux tube theories recently studied through lattice simulations, lie inside a tiny island hundreds of times smaller than the most general space of allowed two-dimensional theories.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Emergent Isotropy in Anisotropic Holographic Systems using Quantum Information measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of holographic quantum information measures including Holographic Entanglement Entropy, Entanglement Wedge Cross-section, and butterfly velocity in a holographic p-wave superconductor model. We find a novel critical temperature, $T_{II}$, where an isotropic point emerges, signaling a shift from anisotropy to isotropy within the bulk geometry. We find that these measures respond differently to anisotropy, with HEE and EWCS revealing effects at various scales, while butterfly velocity is a precise probe of horizon anisotropy. These findings deepen our understanding of anisotropy in correlated systems, highlight the sensitivity of quantum information measures to spacetime structure, and pave the way for exploring quantum correlations in anisotropic phases.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystals stabilized by $\omega$-mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state crystalline structure of nuclear matter in the $\omega$-meson variant of the Skyrme model. After minimizing energy with respect to variations of both the Skyrme field and the period lattice, we find four distinct periodic solutions which are similar to those found in the standard Skyrme model. We use these crystals to calculate coefficients in the Bethe--Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and the compression modulus of infinite nuclear matter, and find a significant improvement as compared with other variants of the Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Bardeen Black Hole in 5-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addressed the scalar field quasinormal ringing behavior of black holes. We investigated scalar field perturbations in Bardeen black hole spacetime in 5-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Using the 3rd-order WKB approximation and the finite-difference method, we computed the frequency of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spacetime background. The calculations demonstrated that the real part of the QNMs $\omega$ increased, whereas the imaginary part decreased with increase in the magnetic charge parameter $Q$ of the Bardeen black hole for a fixed Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\alpha$. This was also valid when $Q$ was fixed and $\alpha$ increased; where in the real part of the QNMs increased and the absolute value of the imaginary part decreased. However, the change in the latter case was more significant than that in the former; thus, the frequency of eigenvibration of this black hole background under the scalar field perturbation increased and the decay of eigenvibration decreased with increase in $\alpha$ or $Q^2$. Moreover, this result shows that the effect of $\alpha$ on the intrinsic vibration of this black hole was greater than that of $Q $.Finally we found an interesting phenomenon by comparing black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. With higher dimensions, the real part of the QNMs changes more obviously, but the imaginary part of the QNMs is almost unchanged. This phenomenon also indicates that the frequency of gravitational waves released by higher dimensional black holes becomes larger, but the decay rate is almost constant.</description>

      <title>Correlation Function Of Thin-Shell Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the correlation functions of thin-shell operators, represented semiclassically by a homogeneous, thin interface of dust particles. Employing the monodromy method, we successfully compute the contribution from the Virasoro vacuum block and present the monodromy equation in a closed form without assuming the probe limit. Although an analytical solution to the monodromy equation remains difficult, we demonstrate that it is perturbatively solvable within specific limits, including the probe, the heavy-shell, and the early-time limits. Moreover, we compare our results with gravitational calculations and find precise agreement. We strengthen our findings by proving that the thermal correlation functions in gravity, after an inverse Laplace transformation, satisfy the field theory's monodromy equation. Additionally, we identify an infinite series of unphysical solutions to the monodromy equation and discuss their potential geometrical duals.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <title>Excitation Transmission through a non-Hermitian traversable wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the intricate real-time dynamics of a non-Hermitian system composed of two interconnected Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. A central finding reveals that an excitation initially localized in the right SYK subsystem can be efficiently transmitted to the left subsystem subsequent to the characteristic scrambling time, a phenomenon facilitated by the intrinsic non-Hermitian nature of the system. The defining hallmark of non-Hermiticity is manifest in the asymmetric conveyance of quantum states, with the non-Hermitian parameter functioning as a tunable knob that selectively amplifies or dampens propagation modes on either side. Despite this inherent directional bias in state transfer, the system sustains two distinct phases, analogously likened to black holes and wormholes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Super Yang-Mills on Branched Covers and Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we conjecture the Coulomb branch partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on weighted projective space $\mathbb{CP}^2_{\boldsymbol{N}}$ for equivariant Donaldson-Witten and ``Pestun-like'' theories. More precisely, we claim that this partition function agrees with the one computed on a certain branched cover of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ upon matching conical deficit angles with corresponding branch indices. Our conjecture is substantiated by checking that similar partition functions on spindles agree with their equivalent on certain branched covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$. We compute the one-loop determinant on the branched cover of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ for all flux sectors via dimensional reduction from the $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on a branched five-sphere along a free $S^1$-action. This work paves the way for obtaining partition functions on more generic symplectic toric orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spin-0 (Particles-Antiparticles) in Bonnor-Melvin Cosmological Space-Time Using the Generalized Feshbach-Villars Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Generalized Feshbach-Villars transformation (GFVT) to investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 scalar particles within the backdrop of a magnetic universe characterized by the Bonnor-Melvin cosmological space-time, which exhibits a geometrical topology resulting in an angular deficit. We derive the radial equation of the Klein-Gordon equation using this FV representation and obtain analytical solutions utilizing special functions. Our analysis demonstrates that various parameters associated with the space-time geometry exert significant influence on the eigenvalue solutions within this novel representation. This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics of particles within the theoretical framework of quantum field theory in curved space-time.</description>

      <title>A Study of Levia-Civita and Cosmic String Solutions in Modified $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research manuscript, we explore cylindrically symmetric solutions within the framework of modified $f(R)$ theories of gravity, where $R$ representing the Ricci scalar. The study focuses on analyzing the cylindrical solutions within realistic space-time regions and investigates three distinct cases of exact solutions derived from the field equations of $f(R)$ theory of gravity. Moreover, we examine well-known Levi-Civita and cosmic string solutions for the said modify gravity. Furthermore, the manuscript delves into the implications of the obtained results by exploring energy conditions for each case. Notably, a violation of null energy conditions is observed, suggesting the potential existence of cylindrical wormholes. The findings contribute to the understanding of modified $f(R)$ theories of gravity, providing valuable insights into the nature of cylindrically symmetric solutions and their implications in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation of a spherically symmetric source in $f(R)$-gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that Birkhoff's theorem for the general theory of relativity is overcome in the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation. That means, the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation, unlike Einstein's general theory of relativity, does not forbid gravitational radiation from a spherically symmetric source (whether stationary or non-stationary). As a consequence, in the $f(R)$-theory a spherically symmetric gravitational deformation (e.g., collapse/expansion or pulsation) could emit gravitational waves (of tensor- and scalar polarization modes), a phenomenon impossible in the general relativity. A test model is examined and it turns out that the gravitational radiation is strongest when the surface of the deforming object is in the vicinity of the (modified) event horizon, even suddenly flares up just outside the latter. In this letter, within the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation, a gravitational wave equation and a formula for the gravitational emission power are derived. These formulae, along with searching for signals, can be used for the experimental test of the $f(R)$-theory. In general, including the spherically symmetry case, gravitational radiation of both tensor- and scalar polarization modes are allowed, although under some circumstance the contribution of scalar modes is strongly suppressed.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing of gravitational waves with modified propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of corrections to the propagation on the waveforms of gravitationally lensed gravitational waves under the geometrical optics approximation, focusing on both uniform cosmological modifications and local modifications localized around lensing objects. By adopting a model-independent phenomenological approach, we systematically investigate the effects of these modifications in strong lensing scenarios, where detection of multiple images is expected. Our analysis reveals that cosmological modifications can yield corrections to the time delay that remain to be minor compared with the effects that accumulate over the whole propagation process, which are present also in the unlensed waveform. By contrast, local modifications around lensing objects can alter the image position and also the magnification factor, which is potentially polarization-selective and frequency-dependent. In some case we can have image disappearance as well as signal amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such modifications can cause degradation of waveform match with the templates based on general relativity. This study highlights the importance of considering waveform modifications to search for the signature of modified propagation or the existence of extra polarization modes, and proposes potential observational targets.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An earlier scheme [arXiv:2404.03360], where torsion plays an essential part in a flat spacetime account of fermion spin, is extended to spacetimes with non-zero Riemann curvature. It is found that further essential features of the fermion, in particular its electromagnetic field, are determined by the curvature and torsion of spacetime. A natural model for the metric, singular along the spin axis of the particle, permits integration of a stress-energy tensor that fixes a realistic electron mass in terms of the Planck mass, despite the many orders of magnitude by which these values differ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spherically symmetric traversable wormholes with a scalar field supported by a phantom field in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic spacetime. Despite coupling the scalar matter field, these wormholes remain massless and symmetric for reflection of the radial coordinate $r \rightarrow -r$. The solution possesses a finite Noether charge $Q$, which varies as a function of frequency $\omega$ with changes in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the throat size $r_0$. Under specific conditions, an approximate ``event horizon'' will appear at the throat.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and their excitation beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of black holes to small perturbations is known to be partially described by a superposition of quasinormal modes. Despite their importance to enable strong-field tests of gravity, little to nothing is known about what overtones and quasinormal-mode amplitudes are like for black holes in extensions to general relativity. We take a first step in this direction and study what is arguably the simplest model that allows first-principle calculations to be made: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. Using a phase-amplitude scheme that uses analytical continuation and the Pr\"ufer transformation, we compute, for the first time, the quasinormal overtone frequencies (in this theory) and quasinormal-mode excitation factors (in any theory beyond general relativity). We find that the overtone quasinormal frequencies and their excitation factors are more sensitive than the fundamental mode to the lengthscale $l$ introduced by the higher-derivative terms in the effective field theory. We argue that a description of all overtones cannot be made within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, and we conjecture that this is a general feature of any extension to general relativity that introduces a new lengthscale. We also find that a parametrization of the modifications to the general-relativistic quasinormal frequencies in terms of the ratio between $l$ and the black hole's mass is somewhat inadequate, and we propose a better alternative. As an application, we perform a preliminary study of the implications of the breakdown, in the effective field theory, of the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated to metric perturbations of polar and axial parity of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. We also present a simple justification for the loss of isospectrality.</description>

      <title>Computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a general procedure for computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we explain the connection between the Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas of Albin and Chang-Qing-Yang for the renormalized volume, and explicitly identify a scalar conformal invariant in the latter formula. Our approach constructs scalar conformal invariants that are divergences at any Einstein manifold; these imply that the scalar invariant in the Chang-Qing-Yang formula is not unique in dimension at least eight. Our procedure also produces explicit conformally invariant Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas for compact Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Stage-IV Cosmic Shear with Modified Gravity and Model-independent Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on minimal model-independent parametrisations of several Modified Gravity theories using mock Stage-IV cosmic shear data. We include nonlinear effects and screening, which ensures recovery of General Relativity on small scales. We introduce a power spectrum emulator to accelerate our analysis and evaluate the robustness of the growth index parametrisation with respect to two cosmologies: $\Lambda$CDM and the normal branch of the DGP model. We forecast the uncertainties on the growth index $\gamma$ to be of the order $\sim 10\%$. We find that our halo-model based screening approach demonstrates excellent performance, meeting the precision requirements of Stage-IV surveys. However, neglecting the screening transition results in biased predictions for cosmological parameters. We find that the screening transition shows significant degeneracy with baryonic feedback, requiring a much better understanding of baryonic physics for its detection. Massive neutrinos effects are less prominent and challenging to detect solely with cosmic shear data.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgent structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of non-perturbative, exponential-type corrections paired with a set of complex numbers, known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be closely related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Modified Gravity using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on physics-informed neural networks to the computation of quasinormal modes of black hole solutions in modified gravity. In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.</description>

Abstract: We study the variance in the measurement of observables during scattering events, as computed using amplitudes. The classical regime, characterised by negligible uncertainty, emerges as a consequence of an infinite set of relationships among multileg, multiloop amplitudes in a momentum-transfer expansion. We discuss two non-trivial examples in detail: the six-point tree and the five-point one-loop amplitudes in scalar QED. We interpret these relationships in terms or a coherent exponentiation of radiative effects in the classical limit which generalises the eikonal formula, and show how to recover the impulse, including radiation reaction, from this generalised eikonal. Finally, we incorporate the physics of spin into our framework.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations alone cannot guarantee causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that linear superpositions of plane waves involving a single-valued, covariantly stable dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ always propagate outside the lightcone, unless $\omega(k) =a+b k$. This implies that there is no notion of causality for individual dispersion relations, since no mathematical condition on the function $\omega(k)$ (such as the front velocity or the asymptotic group velocity conditions) can serve as a sufficient condition for subluminal propagation in dispersive media. Instead, causality can only emerge from a careful cancellation that occurs when one superimposes all the excitation branches of a physical model. This is shown to happen automatically in local theories of matter that are covariantly stable. Hence, we find that the need for nonhydrodynamic modes in relativistic fluid mechanics is analogous to the need for antiparticles in relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: In the hydrodynamic regime, field theories typically have their boost symmetry spontaneously broken due to the presence of a thermal rest frame although the associated Goldstone field does not acquire independent dynamics. We show that this is not the case for Carrollian field theories where the boost Goldstone field plays a central role. This allows us to give a first-principles derivation of the equilibrium currents and dissipative effects of Carrollian fluids. We also demonstrate that the limit of vanishing speed of light of relativistic fluids is a special case of this class of Carrollian fluids. Our results shine light on the thermodynamic properties and thermal partition functions of Carrollian field theories.</description>

Abstract: AdS$_4$ generalized extremal branes are scrutinized in the context of AdS/CFT. Holographic superconductors are studied as dual objects to AdS$_4$ generalized black branes, whose coefficients of response and transport in the dual condensed matter theory are calculated and discussed. The holographic Weyl anomaly is also addressed. The holographic superconductor bound current is shown to be enhanced by the parameter controlling the family of AdS$_4$ generalized extremal brane solutions, when compared to the standard AdS$_4$-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane results. In the probe limit, the electrical DC conductivity for holographic superconductors with AdS$_4$ generalized extremal brane dual background is also reported.</description>

      <title>Improved Reall-Santos method for AdS black holes in general 4-derivative gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For asymptotically flat black holes, Reall-Santos method is a convenient tool to compute leading higher derivative corrections to the thermodynamic quantities without actually solving the modified field equations. However, there are subtleties in its generalization to asymptotically AdS black holes with general higher derivative corrections. First of all, it is necessary to know all the higher derivative holographic counterterms and the surface terms implementing the variational principle and subtracting the divergence. One then needs to solve for the modified AdS radius and rescale the time coordinate in an appropriate way such that the induced metric on the conformal boundary of AdS black hole is not modified. We observe that Reall-Santos method can be directly applied to a particular 4-derivative gravity model, known as the Einstein-Weyl gravity, which does not modify the AdS radius and requires only the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and holographic counterterms for the 2-derivative theory. We thus suggest that to compute the thermodynamic quantities of AdS black holes in general 4-derivative theories of gravity, one simply needs to transform it to a Einstein-Weyl gravity with identical thermodynamic variables by appropriate field redefinitions. We explicitly verify this proposal with spherically-symmetric and static charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory extended with generic 4-derivative interactions.</description>

Abstract: We derive constraints on the four dimensional energy-momentum tensor from gravitational and gauge anomalies. Our work can be considered an extension of Duff's analysis [1] to include parity-odd terms and explicit symmetry breaking. The constraints imply the absence of the parity-odd $R\tilde R$ and $F\tilde F$ terms, for theories whose symmetries are compatible with dimensional regularisation, in a model-independent way. Remarkably, even in the case of explicit symmetry breaking the $\Box R$-anomaly is found to be finite and unambiguous after applying the symmetry constraints. We compute mixed gravity-gauge anomalies at leading order and deduce phenomenological consequences for vector bosons associated with global chiral symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric elementary string states in the compactified heterotic string theory are described by small black holes that have zero area event horizon. In this paper we compute the supersymmetric index of such elementary string states using gravitational path integral. The dominant contribution to the path integral comes from an Euclidean rotating black hole solution of the supergravity theory with a finite area event horizon, but the logarithm of the index, computed from the saddle point, vanishes. Nevertheless we show that the solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon where higher derivative corrections can be important, and once the higher derivative corrections are taken into account the solution could yield a finite result for the logarithm of the index whose form agrees with the microscopic results up to an overall numerical constant. While the numerical constant is not determined in our analysis, we show that it is independent of the details of the compactification and even the number of non-compact dimensions, in agreement with the microscopic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a classification of BPS states in holographic CFTs into monotone and fortuitous, based on their behaviors in the large $N$ limit. Intuitively, monotone BPS states form infinite sequences with increasing rank $N$, while fortuitous ones exist within finite ranges of consecutive ranks. A precise definition is formulated using supercharge cohomology. We conjecture that under the AdS/CFT correspondence, monotone BPS states are dual to smooth horizonless geometries, and fortuitous ones are responsible for typical black hole microstates and give dominant contributions to the entropy. We present supporting evidence for our conjectures in the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and symmetric product orbifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note clarifies and extends results on the complex SYK model to the solvable q = 2 case. We calculate the four point function OPE of fermions in the low energy CFT, implying the existence of a tower of integer-weight operators in the IR. We comment on the lack of a mode breaking conformal symmetry in this special case of SYK and the consequences for deformations of the theory near the conformal fixed point. We use the nearly-free structure of the model to provide a closed form expression for OPE coefficients of the integer-weight operators. We also discuss analytic and numerical results relevant to the thermodynamics of q = 2 SYK in both the complex and real case. The tower of operators transform in the discrete series of representations of SL(2,R), the representations shared by dS2 and AdS2. In this work we continue discussion of holographic models including these representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a view towards higher-spin applications, we study the partition function of a free complex fermion in 2d CFT, restricted to the neutral (zero fermion number) sector. This restriction leads to a partial theta function with a combinatoric interpretation in terms of Dyson's crank of a partition. More crucially, this partition function can be expressed in terms of a q-hypergeometric function with quantum modular properties. This allows us to find its high-temperature asymptotics, including subleading terms which agree with, but also go beyond, what one obtains by imposing neutrality thermodynamically through a chemical potential. We evaluate the asymptotic density of states for this neutral partition function, including the first few subleading terms. Our results should be extendable to more fermions, as well as to higher-spin chemical potentials, which would be of relevance to the higher-spin/minimal model correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We consider the domain wall in the (2+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ double well model, created by extending the $\phi^4$ kink in an additional infinite direction. Classically, the tension is $m^3/3\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the coupling and $m$ is the meson mass. At order $O(\lambda^0)$ all ultraviolet divergences can be removed by normal ordering, less trivial divergences arrive only at the next order. This allows us to easily quantize the domain wall, working at order $O(\lambda^0)$. We calculate the leading quantum correction to its tension as a two-dimensional integral over a function which is determined analytically. This integral is performed numerically, resulting in $-0.0866m^2$. This correction has previously been computed twice in the literature, and the results of these two computations disagreed. Our result agrees with and so confirms that of Jaimunga, Semenoff and Zarembo. We also find, at this order, the excitation spectrum and a general expression for the one-loop tensions of domain walls in other scalar models.</description>

Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum phase transition on the kagome lattice: Distinct velocities of spinon and string excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum phase transition (DQPT) provides an extraordinary possibility of the quantum phase transition beyond the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm, which is interwoven with numerous exotic phenomena of the strongly correlated quantum many-body system, e.g. fractional excitation, emergent symmetries, and gauge field. However, various candidates of DQPT have been demonstrated to be weakly first-order, and the conformal field theory (CFT) has to be altered into a non-unitary one. Here we numerically found two linear dispersions with different velocities in one of the few survivors of DQPT -- the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice. Such counterintuitive results directly lead to the negation of possible emergent Lorentz symmetry, and the breakdown of conventional theory of DQPT. Furthermore, the snapshots of boson configuration hint that these two velocities may correspond to the dynamics of the fractional excitations and quantum strings, respectively. Our work will inspire the revisit of the theory of DQPT and benefit the field of quantum materials and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound State Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial-state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.</description>

      <title>Black holes in degenerate Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Can QNMs distinguish them from GR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, for the first time, we analyse the quasinormal modes of black holes occurring within the framework of degenerate gravity. We investigate the properties of the asymptotically flat spacetimes introduced recently in [JCAP 02(2022)02] that satisfy degenerate Einstein Gauss-Bonnet(dEGB) action and belong to a much larger class of solutions which include cosmological constant. This solution has two distinct branches akin to Einstein Gauss-Bonnet(EBG) gravity. However, unlike the EBG solutions, both the branches of dEGB are well-defined asymptotically. The negative branches from both theories can be identified for the asymptotically flat case. We observe black holes for specific ranges of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter and perform a stability analysis by calculating the quasinormal modes (QNMs) under scalar wave propagation. Finally, the ringdown spectrums of our black holes are compared with their GR counterparts.</description>

      <title>Core and Halo Properties in Multi-Field Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute multi-field core and halo properties in wave Dark Matter models. We focus on the case where Dark Matter consists of two light (real) scalars, interacting gravitationally. As in the single-field Ultra Light Dark Matter (ULDM) case, the scalar field behaves as a coherent BEC with a definite ground state (at fixed total mass), often referred to in the literature as a gravitational soliton. We establish an efficient algorithm to find the ground and excited states of such two-field systems. We then use simulations to investigate the gravitational collapse and virialization, starting from different initial conditions, into solitons and surrounding halo. As in the single-field case, a virialized halo forms with a gravitational soliton (ground state) at the center. We find some evidence for an empirical relation between the soliton mass and energy and those of the host halo. We use this to then find a numerical relation between the properties of the two. Finally, we use this to address the issue of alleviating some of the tensions that single-field ULDM has with observational data, in particular, the issue of how a galaxy's core and radius are related. We find that if galaxies of different masses have similar percentages of the two species, then the core-radius scaling tension is not addressed. However, more general possibilities occur if the relative abundance of species in each halo correlates with the total mass of the galaxy. If this is the case, the model predicts several other phenomenological signatures.</description>

      <title>Equivalence principle and generalised accelerating black holes from binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein equivalence principle in general relativity allows us to interpret accelerating black holes as a black hole immersed into the gravitational field of a larger companion black hole. Indeed it is demonstrated that C-metrics can be obtained as a limit of a binary system where one of the black holes grows indefinitely large, becoming a Rindler horizon. When the bigger black hole, before the limiting process, is of Schwarzschild type we recover usual accelerating black holes belonging to the Plebanski-Demianski class, thus type D. Whether the greater black hole carries some extra features, such as electric charges or rotations, we get generalised accelerating black holes which belong to a more general class, the type I. In that case the background has a richer structure, reminiscent of the physical features of the inflated companion, with respect to the standard Rindler spacetime. This insight allows us to build a general type D metric, describing an accelerating Kerr-NUT black hole. It has well defined limits to all the type-D black holes of general relativity, including the elusive (type-D) accelerating Taub-NUT spacetime. Extension to the presence of the cosmological constant is also provided.</description>

      <title>First-order relativistic hydrodynamics with an information current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to define a timelike future-directed information current within relativistic first-order hydrodynamics. This constitutes the first step toward a covariantly stable and causal formulation of first-order fluctuating hydrodynamics based on thermodynamic principles. We provide several explicit examples of first-order theories with an information current, covering many physical phenomena, ranging from electric conduction to viscosity and elasticity. We use these information currents to compute the corresponding equal-time correlation functions, and we find that the physically relevant (equal-time) correlators do not depend on the choice of the hydrodynamic frame as long as the frame leads to causal and stable dynamics. In the example of chiral hydrodynamics, we find that circularly polarized shear waves have different probabilities of being excited depending on their handedness, generating net helicity in chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of eikonal approximation and survival of Reggeization in presence of dimension-5 Higgs-gluon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the one-loop effective vertex for the interaction of a gluon with a Reggeized gluon and a Higgs boson in the infinite-top-mass limit, which is described by a dimension-5 non-renormalizable operator. This vertex enters the calculation of differential cross sections for the forward inclusive production of a Higgs boson in high-energy proton-proton collisions, possibly in association with a backward jet or identified hadron, in a framework where next-to-leading logarithms of the energy are resummed to all orders. The effective vertex is extracted from the high-energy behavior of two-to-two amplitudes for the Higgs production in parton-parton collisions and relies on the validity of the Regge form for these amplitudes. We find that the usual eikonal approximation (Gribov prescription) for the Regge limit and the known region-expansion technique in this limit lead to an incomplete result for the amplitude. The discrepancy is traced back to the non-renormalizable nature of the involved operator. However, the Regge limit of the exact QCD amplitude agrees with the Regge-pole exchange form at one loop, nontrivially supporting the Reggeization hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We consider baryogenesis in quantum fluctuation modified gravity. We explore three forms (two are newly proposed here) of baryogenesis interaction and discuss the effect of these interaction terms on the baryon-to-entropy ratio during the radiation era of the expanding universe. We constrain the model parameters with the current observational data, implying that this modified gravity is capable to address the issue of baryon asymmetry in a successful manner.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework systematically formalizes and generalizes the ambient space techniques regularly employed in conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.3\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>
