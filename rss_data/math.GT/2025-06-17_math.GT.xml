      <title>Tropical Ptolemy Transformations and Invariants of Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It often happens in mathematics that one and the same equation is known under different names in different areas of mathematics. The famous pentagon identity appears in low-dimensional topology in different ways. In this paper, we use the tropical version of the Ptolemy equation to construct invariants of braids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the minimal length of a filling (multi-)geodesic on a genus $g$ hyperbolic surface in the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces and show that it is realized by the geodesic whose complement is a right-angled regular $(8g-4)$-gon. A single geodesic realizing this minimum is provided.</description>

      <title>Affine Deformations of Divisible Convex Cones and Affine Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ obtained by adding a translation part to a torsion-free discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})$ dividing a convex domain in the sense of Benoist, we construct two maximal convex domains on which the affine action of that subgroup is free and properly continuous. We also introduce a notion of "affine spacetime" structure, with which quotients of those domains are naturally endowed. In that setting, we show that those quotients are Maximal Globally Hyperbolic affine spacetimes admitting a locally uniformly Convex and Compact Cauchy surface (denoted as a MGHCC affine spacetimes), and that they come with a cosmological time function with Cauchy hypersurfaces foliating the quotient affine spacetime as level sets. Finally, we show that those are the only examples of such MGHCC affine spacetimes. All these results generalise the work of Mess, Barbot and Bonsante on affine deformations of uniform lattices of $\mathrm{SO}_0(d,1)$.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric profiles of lamplighter-like groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated amenable group $H$ satisfying some mild assumptions, we relate isoperimetric profiles of the lampshuffler group $\mathsf{Shuffler}(H)=\mathsf{FSym}(H)\rtimes H$ to those of $H$. Our results are sharp for all exponential growth groups for which isoperimetric profiles are known, including Brieussel-Zheng groups. This refines previous estimates obtained by Erschler and Zheng and by Saloff-Coste and Zheng. The most difficult part is to find an optimal upper bound, and our strategy consists in finding suitable lamplighter subgraphs in lampshufflers. This novelty applies more generally for many examples of halo products, a class of groups introduced recently by Genevois and Tessera as a natural generalisation of wreath products. Lastly, we also give applications of our estimates on isoperimetric profiles to the existence problem of regular maps between such groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the symplectic mapping class group of a $4$-dimensional Weinstein domain, we give a relation between two products of (right-handed) Dehn twists via holomorphic curve techniques. A key ingredient of the construction is a solution to the symplectic isotopy problem on symplectic submanifolds in del Pezzo surfaces. In the appendix, we provide an alternative proof of a relation between a fibered Dehn twist and a product of Dehn twists.</description>

      <title>Forbidden complexes for the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simplicial complex is said to be {\em critical} (or {\em forbidden}) for the 3-sphere $S^3$ if it cannot be embedded in $S^3$, but becomes embeddable upon removing the open star of any simplex in its second barycentric subdivision.
  We show that if a regular multibranched surface cannot be embedded in $S^3$, then it contains a critical complex consisting of a multibranched surface and, possibly, a graph. We classify all critical complexes for $S^3$ that are contained in the $K_5 \times S^1$ and $K_{3,3} \times S^1$ families. Additionally, we classify all critical complexes for $S^3$ that decompose as $(G \times S^1) \cup H$, where $G$ and $H$ are graphs whose intersection $G \cap H$ consists solely of vertices of $H$.
  Nevertheless, some complexes cannot be embedded in $S^3$ and yet do not contain any critical subcomplex. Motivated by such examples, we define an equivalence relation on the set of simplicial complexes $\mathcal{C}$, leading to a partially ordered set $(\mathcal{C}/\mathord\sim; \subseteqq)$, and refine the definition of critical. According to the refined definition of criticality, we prove that if a 2-dimensional complex $X$ cannot be embedded in $S^3$, then there exists $[X']\subseteqq [X]$ such that $[X']$ is critical for $[S^3]$.</description>

Abstract: We describe an alternative way of computing Alexander polynomials of knots/links, based on the Artin representation of the corresponding braids by automorphisms of a free group. Then we apply the same method to other representations of braid groups discovered by Wada and compare the corresponding isotopic invariants to Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>Positivity of simplicial volume for closed nonpositively curved four-manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>

      <title>Symplectic submanifolds in dimension $6$ from hyperelliptic Lefschetz fibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a closed, simply connected, symplectic $6$-manifold having infinitely many codimension $2$ symplectic submanifolds. These are mutually homologous but homotopy inequivalent, and furthermore, they cannot admit complex structures. The key ingredient for the construction is hyperelliptic Lefschetz fibrations on $4$-manifolds. As a corollary, we present a similar result on symplectic submanifolds of codimension $2$ in higher dimensions. In the appendix, we give a proof of the well-known fact that all symplectic submanifolds of codimension $2$ in $(\mathbb{CP}^3, \omega_{\mathrm{FS}})$ of a fixed degree $\leq 3$ are mutually diffeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Can solvents tie knots? Helical folds of biopolymers in liquid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Helices are the quintessential geometric motif of the microscale, from alpha-helices in proteins to double helices in DNA. Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity. By simulating folding in a simplified setting we probe the role of the solvent in the collaborative processes governing biomaterials. Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments in which a short, flexible tube-modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment-folds solely based on the interaction of the tube with the solvent. Our findings reveal a variety of helical structures that assemble depending on solvent conditions, including overhand knots and symmetric double helices. By differentiating the role of solvation, our work illuminates the environment of all soluble biomolecules, demonstrating that the solvent can drive fundamental rearrangements, even up to tying a simple overhand knot.</description>

      <title>Existence of Minimal Surfaces in Infinite Volume Hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of embedded minimal surfaces in non-compact 3-manifolds remains a largely unresolved and challenging problem in geometry. In this paper, we address several open cases regarding the existence of finite-area, embedded, complete, minimal surfaces in infinite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
  Among other results, for doubly degenerate manifolds with bounded geometry, we prove a dichotomy: either every such manifold contains a closed minimal surface or there exists such a manifold admitting a foliation by closed minimal surfaces. We also construct the first examples of Schottky manifolds with closed minimal surfaces and demonstrate the existence of Schottky manifolds containing infinitely many closed minimal surfaces. Lastly, for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with rank-1 cusps, we show that a broad class of these manifolds must contain a finite-area, embedded, complete minimal surface.</description>
