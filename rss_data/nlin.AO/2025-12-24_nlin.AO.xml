      <title>Metastability induced by non-reciprocal adaptive couplings in Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings are frequently found in systems out-of-equilibrium such as neuronal networks. We consider generalized Kuramoto models with non-reciprocal adaptive couplings. The non-reciprocity refers to the type of couplings according to Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules and to different time scales, on which the couplings evolve. The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metatstability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters are individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties" between clusters of synchronized oscillators. The time series have random features, but derive from deterministic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Marangoni-Driven Elliptical Janus Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous motion of an elliptical Janus particle, driven by Marangoni forces, on a water surface to understand how particle shape and size influence its dynamics. The Janus particle is one-half infused with a substance such as camphor, which lowers the surface tension upon release onto the water surface. The resulting surface tension gradient generates Marangoni forces that propel the particle. For fully camphor-infused (non-Janus) particles, previous studies have shown that motion occurs along the short axis of the ellipse. However, for Janus particles, our experiments reveal a much richer steady-state dynamics, depending on both the particle's eccentricity and size. To understand these dynamics, we develop a numerical model that captures the connection between the spatio-temporal evolution of the camphor concentration field and the Marangoni force driving the particle. Using this model, we simulate the motion of particles with varying eccentricities - from nearly circular to highly elongated shapes. The simulations qualitatively reproduce all the trajectories observed in experiments and provide insights into how particle geometry influences the dynamics of chemically driven anisotropic particles. With the help of the numerical model, we compute a full phase diagram characterising the dynamical states as a function of surfactant properties.</description>

      <title>Cell differentiation can underpin the reproducibility of morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morphogenesis of complex body shapes is reproducible despite the noise inherent in the underlying morphogenetic processes. However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. We show that high reproducibility is caused by segregating moving cells that "shape" morphologies from stationary cells that "maintain" morphologies during morphogenesis. Strikingly, most highly reproducible morphologies also evolved cell differentiation, where proliferative, moving stem cells (i.e., progenitor cells) irreversibly differentiate into non-dividing, stationary differentiated cells. These results suggest that cell differentiation observed in natural development plays a fundamental role in morphogenesis in addition to the production of specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of cell differentiation has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.</description>
