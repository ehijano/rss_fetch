      <title>Does Turbulence at the Correlation Scale Regulate the Statistics of Magnetic Reconnection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of dynamical quantities associated with magnetic reconnection events embedded in a sea of strong background magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using direct numerical simulations. We focus on the relationship of the reconnection properties to the statistics of global turbulent fields. For the first time, we show that the distribution in turbulence of reconnection rates (determined by upstream fields) is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the global turbulent magnetic field at the correlation scale. The average reconnection rates, and associated dissipation rates, during turbulence are thus much larger than predicted by using turbulent magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes at the dissipation or kinetic scales. Magnetic reconnection may therefore be playing a major role in energy dissipation in astrophysical and heliospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Full-wave computation of SUb-atmospheric Radio-frequency Engine (SURE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-space, which covers altitudes from 20 to 100 kilometers, has been receiving more and more attention because of its special strategic value. Airships and high-altitude balloons are two common types of low-speed vehicles that operate in this region. They can be used for jobs like monitoring, communication, and remote sensing, but they need efficient propulsion systems to work well. Earlier, we proposed a new type of electric propulsion system that can ionize the surrounding air to create plasma and produce thrust for near-space vehicles. However, in past experiments, not enough was known about how certain parameters affect power absorption and electromagnetic behavior. Therefore, in this study, we used computer simulations to examine how gas pressure (200 to 1000 Pa), input power (200 to 600 W), frequency (13.56 to 52.24 MHz), and different gas types ($Ar$, $N_2$, $H_2$, $He$) influence inductively coupled plasma inside a quartz tube. We especially focused on comparing two antenna designs: one with a single turn and one with five turns. In all the simulations, the single-turn antenna consistently absorbed power better than the five-turns antenna. Higher frequencies significantly influence both plasma power absorption and magnetic field characteristics. The optimal power absorption occurs at a filling gas pressure of 400 Pa. When varying the input power, we observed an initial decrease followed by an increasing trend, which may be related to ionization mechanisms. In comparisons among different gas types, the inelastic collision mechanisms in molecular gases lead to a notable reduction in plasma power absorption efficiency. The results from this work will help guide the design of future experiments for this electric propulsion concept.</description>

      <title>Ion Stochastic Heating by Low-frequency Alfv\'en Wave Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\'en waves are commonly found in plasma environments, such as space plasmas, and play a crucial role in ion heating. The nonlinear interaction between oblique Alfv\'en wave spectra and ions has been studied. As the number of wave modes increases, ions are more likely to exhibit chaotic motion and experience stochastic heating. The stochastic heating threshold in the parameter space can be characterized by a single parameter, the effective relative curvature radius $P_{{eff.}}$. The results show excellent agreement with the chaotic regions identified through test particle simulations. The anisotropic characteristics of stochastic heating are explained using a uniform solid angle distribution model. The stochastic heating rate $Q=\dot{T}$ is calculated, and its relationship with wave conditions is expressed as $Q/(\Omega_i m_i v_A^2) = H(\alpha) \tilde{v}^3 \tilde{B}_w^2 \tilde{\omega}_1$, where $\alpha$ is propagating angle, $\Omega_i$ is the gyrofrequency, $m_i$ is the ion mass, $v_A$ is the Alfv\'en speed, $\tilde{v}$ is the dimensionless speed, $\tilde{B}_w$ is the dimensionless wave amplitude, and $\tilde{\omega}_1$ is the lowest dimensionless wave frequency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Machine Scaling Laws for Fuel and Impurity Puffing Rates Sufficient for Detachment Access: a Systematic Review of Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open-source database encompassing 457 experimental and numerical entries from 32 machines among solid-walled tokamaks, stellarators and linear plasma devices is assembled. From there, we derive physics-informed multi-machine scaling laws predictive of fuel and impurity puffing rates sufficient to access plasma detachment -- leading candidate for a reactor-relevant solution to the open issue of plasma-wall interaction. Validation of our laws in up to 40 plasmas in low- and high-confinement mode also featuring advanced configurations demonstrates accuracy within a factor 1.5 in up to 50% of the instances, and within a factor 2 on average. Divertor volume alone is found to correlate to fuelling. The addition of plasma opaqueness leads to the empirically-calibrated law $\Gamma_{\text{D}}\propto [n_{\text{sep}}\times a\times(S_{\text{div}}/V_{\text{div}})^{-1.5}]^{1.05}$ valid across all toroidal devices. Its simplification to $\Gamma_{\text{D}}^{\text{HDL}}\propto 0.43\times a^{1.58}\times\lambda_q^{-0.89}$ avoids a dependence on $n_{\text{sep}}$ and bears intrinsic significance provided by the H/L density limit and the power fall-off length. Non-linearities of the impurity dynamics manifest in the seeding rate -- which the present work identifies both a generalised formula for, and the Greenwald-Eich-Scarabosio simplification $\Gamma_{\text{Z}}^{\text{GES}}\propto a^{1.51}\times\lambda_q^{-0.27}$. Similar relationships are defined for stellarators, closely following the mainstream but without providing data for validation -- which should stimulate further investigations. In the era of nuclear fusion reactor design, these results find immediate applicability in informing reactor fuel cycle design and edge plasma modelling. More generally, this study demonstrates that physics-based 0D laws able to relate detachment to the engineering actuators exist.</description>

      <title>Dual formulation of the maximum entropy method applied to analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many fields of physics use quantum Monte Carlo techniques, but struggle to estimate dynamic spectra via the analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error. The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, "Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method" Data 5.3 (2020)]. We present new theoretical issues that are not yet in the literature. Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.</description>
