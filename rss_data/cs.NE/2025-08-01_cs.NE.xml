      <title>From Propagator to Oscillator: The Dual Role of Symmetric Differential Equations in Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic engineering.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Fast and Reliable Parameter Extraction in Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60 seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80% of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting techniques.</description>

      <title>Finger Force Decoding from Motor Units Activity on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable neurotechnology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Methods for Memristive Reservoir Computing for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.</description>
