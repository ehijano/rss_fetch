      <title>$\Lambda$-Enhanced Gray Molasses Cooling of $^{85}$Rb Atoms in Tweezers Using the D$_2$ Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the implementation of $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling on the D$_2$ line of $^{85}$Rb atoms in an optical tweezer array. This technique yields lower atomic temperatures of 4.0(2) $\mu$K compared to red-detuned polarization gradient cooling, and consequently extends the $T_2^*$ coherence time of the hyperfine clock qubit by a factor of 1.5. The method is alignment-free and can be readily implemented on laser beams used for magneto-optical trapping, as it only requires frequency and phase modulation control. Our experimental observations are corroborated by a numerical model based on a semi-classical force approach extended to a four-level system, including two hyperfine states of the upper manifold that are 120 MHz apart.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential method for atomic structure in the random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>

      <title>Theory of Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the photoelectron angular distributions produced by elliptical and cross-polarized two-color laser fields interacting with randomly oriented chiral molecules decompose into four irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group. One of these ($A_u$) corresponds to a non-dichroic enantiosensitive (NoDES) contribution. This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects. NoDES spectroscopy thus provides a symmetry-protected and phase-robust route to probe molecular chirality on the ultrafast time scale. The experimental confirmation of our theory is presented in the companion paper [L. Fede et al., arXiv (2025)].</description>

      <title>Simulation of topological superconductors and their competing orders using photon-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing and controlling the unconventional pairing featured by topological superconductors remains a central challenge. We introduce a cavity QED quantum simulator that engineers competing chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ orders by tailoring cavity-mediated couplings between atomic pseudospins that emulate momentum-dependent pairing channels. The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion selective tests of new physics with the bound electron g-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of high-precision measurements of the $g$ factor of single-electron ions is considered as a detailed probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. The contribution of the exchange of a hypothetical force-carrying scalar boson to the $g$ factor is calculated for the ground state of H-like ions and used to derive bounds on the parameters of that force. Similarly to the isotope shift, we employ the nuclide shift, i.e. the difference for elements with different proton and/or neutron numbers, in order to increase the experimental sensitivity to the new physics contribution. In particular we find, combining available measurements with current precision with different ions, that the coupling constant for the interaction between an electron and a proton can be constrained up to three orders of magnitude better than with the best current atomic data and theory.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Thermal Fields on Rydberg Atom Radio Frequency Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors are unique in a number of ways, including possessing extraordinary carrier bandwidth, self-calibration and accuracy. In this paper, we examine the impact of thermal radiation on Rydberg atom sensors. Antennas are limited by their thermal background, while Rydberg atom sensors are coherent sensors. Incoherent thermal radiation does not limit Rydberg atom sensors in the same way as an antenna. The primary consequence of a thermal radiation field on Rydberg atom sensors is to decrease their coherence, as the decay rates of the Rydberg states used for sensing the radio frequency field are increased due to the thermal field, i.e. blackbody, modification of the atomic decay rates. Thermal and coherent field excitation are fundamentally different in that thermal fields produce statistically independent excitations with well-defined frequency, polarization, and propagation direction, while coherent states are coherent superpositions of photon number states. Consequently, thermal fields do not contribute to the coherences of the density matrix that are used for Rydberg atom sensing, except for damping them.</description>

      <title>Role of quantum dynamics in coherent and incoherent radiation during tunneling ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation during strong-field tunneling ionization is investigated. The spontaneous as well as the coherent components of the radiation are calculated describing the ionization dynamics via the strong field approximation and the role of the quantum dynamics at tunneling is analyzed. The competition between different mechanisms in different spectral regions is examined. Transition-like radiation (Brunel radiation) is dominated at low-frequencies, Thomson scattering at the laser frequency, and radiative recombination via the three-step process at high-order harmonics. To distinguish the role of the quantum dynamics, simple man Drude models are developed for the coherent as well as for spontaneous radiation, which are based on the electron trajectory out of the tunneling barrier. The quantum dynamics is shown to modify the coherent Brunel radiation for near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses. The significant role of free-free transitions is demonstrated for the spontaneous radiation in the low-frequency region.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Relations in an Array of Neutral Atom Qubits -- Experimental Validation of Control Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study, we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between amplitude noise of the control signal and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10x10 site optical tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Our results show a good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era quantum systems.</description>
