      <title>Community Driven Approaches to Research in Technology &amp; Society CCC Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our workshop activities, we outlined three ways in which research can support community needs: (1) Mapping the ecosystem of both the players and ecosystem and harm landscapes, (2) Counter-Programming, which entails using the same surveillance tools that communities are subjected to observe the entities doing the surveilling, effectively protecting people from surveillance, and conducting ethical data collection to measure the impact of these technologies, and (3) Engaging in positive visions and tools for empowerment so that technology can bring good instead of harm.
  In order to effectively collaborate on the aforementioned directions, we outlined seven important mechanisms for effective collaboration: (1) Never expect free labor of community members, (2) Ensure goals are aligned between all collaborators, (3) Elevate community members to leadership positions, (4) Understand no group is a monolith, (5) Establish a common language, (6) Discuss organization roles and goals of the project transparently from the start, and (7) Enable a recourse for harm.
  We recommend that anyone engaging in community-based research (1) starts with community-defined solutions, (2) provides alternatives to digital services/information collecting mechanisms, (3) prohibits harmful automated systems, (4) transparently states any systems impact, (5) minimizes and protects data, (6) proactively demonstrates a system is safe and beneficial prior to deployment, and (7) provides resources directly to community partners.
  Throughout the recommendation section of the report, we also provide specific recommendations for funding agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers.</description>

      <title>A Large Medical Model based on Visual Physiological Monitoring for Public Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has sounded a warning about the globalization challenges in public health. In this context, the establishment of large-scale public health datasets, of medical models, and of decision-making systems with a human-centric approach holds strategic significance. Recently, groundbreaking advancements have emerged in AI methods for physiological signal monitoring and disease diagnosis based on camera sensors. These approaches, requiring no specialized medical equipment, offer convenient manners of collecting large-scale medical data in response to public health events. Not only do these methods facilitate the acquisition of unbiased datasets, but also enable the development of fair large medical models (LMMs). Therefore, we outline a prospective framework and heuristic vision for a public health large medical model (PHLMM) utilizing visual-based physiological monitoring (VBPM) technology. The PHLMM can be considered as a "convenient and universal" framework for public health, advancing the United Nations' "Sustainable Development Goals 2030", particularly in its promotion of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, this paper provides an outlook on the crucial application prospects of PHLMM in response to public health challenges and its significant role in the field of AI for medicine (AI4medicine). In summary, PHLMM serves as a solution for constructing a large-scale medical database and LMM, eliminating the issue of dataset bias and unfairness in AI models. The outcomes will contribute to the establishment of an LMM framework for public health, acting as a crucial bridge for advancing AI4medicine.</description>

      <title>Supporting Self-Reflection at Scale with Large Language Models: Insights from Randomized Field Experiments in Classrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-reflection on learning experiences constitutes a fundamental cognitive process, essential for the consolidation of knowledge and the enhancement of learning efficacy. However, traditional methods to facilitate reflection often face challenges in personalization, immediacy of feedback, engagement, and scalability. Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the reflection process could mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we conducted two randomized field experiments in undergraduate computer science courses to investigate the potential of LLMs to help students engage in post-lesson reflection. In the first experiment (N=145), students completed a take-home assignment with the support of an LLM assistant; half of these students were then provided access to an LLM designed to facilitate self-reflection. The results indicated that the students assigned to LLM-guided reflection reported increased self-confidence and performed better on a subsequent exam two weeks later than their peers in the control condition. In the second experiment (N=112), we evaluated the impact of LLM-guided self-reflection against other scalable reflection methods, such as questionnaire-based activities and review of key lecture slides, after assignment. Our findings suggest that the students in the questionnaire and LLM-based reflection groups performed equally well and better than those who were only exposed to lecture slides, according to their scores on a proctored exam two weeks later on the same subject matter. These results underscore the utility of LLM-guided reflection and questionnaire-based activities in improving learning outcomes. Our work highlights that focusing solely on the accuracy of LLMs can overlook their potential to enhance metacognitive skills through practices such as self-reflection. We discuss the implications of our research for the Edtech community.</description>

      <title>A Labelled Dataset for Sentiment Analysis of Videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Other Sources about the 2024 Outbreak of Measles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work of this paper presents a dataset that contains the data of 4011 videos about the ongoing outbreak of measles published on 264 websites on the internet between January 1, 2024, and May 31, 2024. The dataset is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/40s8-xf63. These websites primarily include YouTube and TikTok, which account for 48.6% and 15.2% of the videos, respectively. The remainder of the websites include Instagram and Facebook as well as the websites of various global and local news organizations. For each of these videos, the URL of the video, title of the post, description of the post, and the date of publication of the video are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis (using VADER), subjectivity analysis (using TextBlob), and fine-grain sentiment analysis (using DistilRoBERTa-base) of the video titles and video descriptions were performed. This included classifying each video title and video description into (i) one of the sentiment classes i.e. positive, negative, or neutral, (ii) one of the subjectivity classes i.e. highly opinionated, neutral opinionated, or least opinionated, and (iii) one of the fine-grain sentiment classes i.e. fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset for the training and testing of machine learning algorithms for performing sentiment analysis or subjectivity analysis in this field as well as for other applications. Finally, this paper also presents a list of open research questions that may be investigated using this dataset.</description>

      <title>Metaverse Identity: Core Principles and Critical Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the core principles that should guide the construction and governance of identity in the metaverse and identifies the critical challenges that need to be addressed. Drawing on multidisciplinary theories and perspectives, we propose two core principles for metaverse identity: \emph{Equivalence and Alignment}, and \emph{Fusion and Expansiveness}. The first principle contends that metaverse identities should be consistent with real-world identities in terms of norms and standards, which is crucial for establishing guidelines and safeguarding rights. The second principle emphasizes the necessity for seamless integration and boundless expansion of metaverse identities, transcending real-world limitations to accommodate diverse needs and foster inclusive participation. We argue that these two principles are vital for ensuring the accountability, inclusiveness, and consistency of identity in the metaverse. We also identify five critical challenges: Identity Interoperability, Legal Implications, Privacy and Identity Management, Deepfakes and Synthetic Identities, and Identity Fragmentation and Psychological Well-being. We discuss potential strategies to navigate these challenges. The paper concludes by underscoring the importance of a proactive and collaborative approach to shaping the future of metaverse identity. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it is imperative that we cultivate a thorough understanding of the principles and challenges surrounding identity in this uncharted territory and work collectively to build a metaverse that fosters responsible identity construction and expression.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand Human Personality? -- Comparing Human Experts and AI Systems at Predicting Personality Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the abilities of specialised deep neural networks like PersonalityMap as well as general LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus in understanding human personality. Specifically, we compare their ability to predict correlations between personality items to the abilities of lay people and academic experts. We find that when compared with individual humans, all AI models make better predictions than the vast majority of lay people and academic experts. However, when selecting the median prediction for each item, we find a different pattern: Experts and PersonalityMap outperform LLMs and lay people on most measures. Our results suggest that while frontier LLMs' are better than most individual humans at predicting correlations between personality items, specialised models like PersonalityMap continue to match or exceed expert human performance even on some outcome measures where LLMs underperform. This provides evidence both in favour of the general capabilities of large language models and in favour of the continued place for specialised models trained and deployed for specific domains.</description>

      <title>Banal Deception Human-AI Ecosystems: A Study of People's Perceptions of LLM-generated Deceptive Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can provide users with false, inaccurate, or misleading information, and we consider the output of this type of information as what Natale (2021) calls `banal' deceptive behaviour. Here, we investigate peoples' perceptions of ChatGPT-generated deceptive behaviour and how this affects peoples' own behaviour and trust. To do this, we use a mixed-methods approach comprising of (i) an online survey with 220 participants and (ii) semi-structured interviews with 12 participants. Our results show that (i) the most common types of deceptive information encountered were over-simplifications and outdated information; (ii) humans' perceptions of trust and `worthiness' of talking to ChatGPT are impacted by `banal' deceptive behaviour; (iii) the perceived responsibility for deception is influenced by education level and the frequency of deceptive information; and (iv) users become more cautious after encountering deceptive information, but they come to trust the technology more when they identify advantages of using it. Our findings contribute to the understanding of human-AI interaction dynamics in the context of \textit{Deceptive AI Ecosystems}, and highlight the importance of user-centric approaches to mitigating the potential harms of deceptive AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unravelling Local Government Data Sharing Barriers in Estonia and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estonia's digital government success has received global acclaim, yet its Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives, especially at the local level, encounter persistent challenges. Despite significant progress of national OGD initiative in OGD rankings, local governments lag in OGD provision. This study aims to examine barriers hindering municipalities from openly sharing OGD. Employing a qualitative approach through interviews with Estonian municipalities and drawing on the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model, the study sheds light on barriers impeding OGD sharing. Practical recommendations are proposed to bridge the gap between national policies and local implementation, including enhancing awareness, improving data governance frameworks, and fostering collaboration be-tween local and national authorities. By addressing overlooked weaknesses in the Estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. Additionally, by validating the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. Ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local OGD initiatives.</description>

      <title>Situated Ground Truths: Enhancing Bias-Aware AI by Situating Data Labels with SituAnnotate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary world of AI and data-driven applications, supervised machines often derive their understanding, which they mimic and reproduce, through annotations--typically conveyed in the form of words or labels. However, such annotations are often divorced from or lack contextual information, and as such hold the potential to inadvertently introduce biases when subsequently used for training. This paper introduces SituAnnotate, a novel ontology explicitly crafted for 'situated grounding,' aiming to anchor the ground truth data employed in training AI systems within the contextual and culturally-bound situations from which those ground truths emerge. SituAnnotate offers an ontology-based approach to structured and context-aware data annotation, addressing potential bias issues associated with isolated annotations. Its representational power encompasses situational context, including annotator details, timing, location, remuneration schemes, annotation roles, and more, ensuring semantic richness. Aligned with the foundational Dolce Ultralight ontology, it provides a robust and consistent framework for knowledge representation. As a method to create, query, and compare label-based datasets, SituAnnotate empowers downstream AI systems to undergo training with explicit consideration of context and cultural bias, laying the groundwork for enhanced system interpretability and adaptability, and enabling AI models to align with a multitude of cultural contexts and viewpoints.</description>

      <title>Automated Pavement Cracks Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring asset conditions is a crucial factor in building efficient transportation asset management. Because of substantial advances in image processing, traditional manual classification has been largely replaced by semi-automatic/automatic techniques. As a result, automated asset detection and classification techniques are required. This paper proposes a methodology to detect and classify roadway pavement cracks using the well-known You Only Look Once (YOLO) version five (YOLOv5) and version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithms. Experimental results indicated that the precision of pavement crack detection reaches up to 67.3% under different illumination conditions and image sizes. The findings of this study can assist highway agencies in accurately detecting and classifying asset conditions under different illumination conditions. This will reduce the cost and time that are associated with manual inspection, which can greatly reduce the cost of highway asset maintenance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the impacts of AI-driven coding tools on engineers' workflow and work environment, we utilize the Jellyfish platform to analyze indicators of change. Key indicators are derived from Allocations, Coding Fraction vs. PR Fraction, Lifecycle Phases, Cycle Time, Jira ticket size, PR pickup time, PR comments, PR comment count, interactions, and coding languages. Significant changes were observed in coding time fractions among Copilot users, with an average decrease of 3% with individual decreases as large as 15%. Ticket sizes decreased by an average of 16% across four companies, accompanied by an 8% decrease in cycle times, whereas the control group showed no change. Additionally, the PR process evolved with Copilot usage, featuring longer and more comprehensive comments, despite the weekly number of PRs reviewed remaining constant. Not all hypothesized changes were observed across all participating companies. However, some companies experienced a decrease in PR pickup times by up to 33%, indicating reduced workflow bottlenecks, and one company experienced a shift of up to 17% of effort from maintenance and support work towards product growth initiatives. This study is the first to utilize data from more than one company and goes beyond simple productivity and satisfaction measures, considering real-world engineering settings instead. By doing so, we highlight that some companies seem to benefit more than others from the use of Copilot and that changes can be subtle when investigating aggregates rather than specific aspects of engineering work and workflows - something that will be further investigated in the future.</description>

      <title>Using AI-Based Coding Assistants in Practice: State of Affairs, Perceptions, and Ways Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last several years saw the emergence of AI assistants for code -- multi-purpose AI-based helpers in software engineering. Their quick development makes it necessary to better understand how specifically developers are using them, why they are not using them in certain parts of their development workflow, and what needs to be improved.
  In this work, we carried out a large-scale survey aimed at how AI assistants are used, focusing on specific software development activities and stages. We collected opinions of 481 programmers on five broad activities: (a) implementing new features, (b) writing tests, (c) bug triaging, (d) refactoring, and (e) writing natural-language artifacts, as well as their individual stages.
  Our results show that usage of AI assistants varies depending on activity and stage. For instance, developers find writing tests and natural-language artifacts to be the least enjoyable activities and want to delegate them the most, currently using AI assistants to generate tests and test data, as well as generating comments and docstrings most of all. This can be a good focus for features aimed to help developers right now. As for why developers do not use assistants, in addition to general things like trust and company policies, there are fixable issues that can serve as a guide for further research, e.g., the lack of project-size context, and lack of awareness about assistants. We believe that our comprehensive and specific results are especially needed now to steer active research toward where users actually need AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Political Leaning Inference through Plurinational Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media users express their political preferences via interaction with other users, by spontaneous declarations or by participation in communities within the network. This makes a social network such as Twitter a valuable data source to study computational science approaches to political learning inference. In this work we focus on three diverse regions in Spain (Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia) to explore various methods for multi-party categorization, required to analyze evolving and complex political landscapes, and compare it with binary left-right approaches. We use a two-step method involving unsupervised user representations obtained from the retweets and their subsequent use for political leaning detection. Comprehensive experimentation on a newly collected and curated dataset comprising labeled users and their interactions demonstrate the effectiveness of using Relational Embeddings as representation method for political ideology detection in both binary and multi-party frameworks, even with limited training data. Finally, data visualization illustrates the ability of the Relational Embeddings to capture intricate intra-group and inter-group political affinities.</description>

      <title>AustroTox: A Dataset for Target-Based Austrian German Offensive Language Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model interpretability in toxicity detection greatly profits from token-level annotations. However, currently such annotations are only available in English. We introduce a dataset annotated for offensive language detection sourced from a news forum, notable for its incorporation of the Austrian German dialect, comprising 4,562 user comments. In addition to binary offensiveness classification, we identify spans within each comment constituting vulgar language or representing targets of offensive statements. We evaluate fine-tuned language models as well as large language models in a zero- and few-shot fashion. The results indicate that while fine-tuned models excel in detecting linguistic peculiarities such as vulgar dialect, large language models demonstrate superior performance in detecting offensiveness in AustroTox. We publish the data and code.</description>

      <title>A Sociotechnical Lens for Evaluating Computer Vision Models: A Case Study on Detecting and Reasoning about Gender and Emotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of computer vision (CV) technologies, the automatic detection and interpretation of gender and emotion in images is a critical area of study. This paper investigates social biases in CV models, emphasizing the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics often fall short in capturing the complexities of gender and emotion, which are fluid and culturally nuanced constructs. Our study proposes a sociotechnical framework for evaluating CV models, incorporating both technical performance measures and considerations of social fairness. Using a dataset of 5,570 images related to vaccination and climate change, we empirically compared the performance of various CV models, including traditional models like DeepFace and FER, and generative models like GPT-4 Vision. Our analysis involved manually validating the gender and emotional expressions in a subset of images to serve as benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while GPT-4 Vision outperforms other models in technical accuracy for gender classification, it exhibits discriminatory biases, particularly in response to transgender and non-binary personas. Furthermore, the model's emotion detection skew heavily towards positive emotions, with a notable bias towards associating female images with happiness, especially when prompted by male personas. These findings underscore the necessity of developing more comprehensive evaluation criteria that address both validity and discriminatory biases in CV models. Our proposed framework provides guidelines for researchers to critically assess CV tools, ensuring their application in communication research is both ethical and effective. The significant contribution of this study lies in its emphasis on a sociotechnical approach, advocating for CV technologies that support social good and mitigate biases rather than perpetuate them.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of social network polarization and its impact on the propagation of a virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 has highlighted the complex interplay between vaccine hesitancy and societal polarization. In this study, we analyse the dynamical polarization within a social network as well as the network properties before and after a vaccine was made available. Our results show that as the network evolves from a less structured state to one with more clustered communities. Then using an agent-based modeling approach, we simulate the propagation of a virus in a polarized society by assigning vaccines to pro-vaccine individuals and none to the anti-vaccine individuals. We compare this propagation to the case where the same number of vaccines is distributed homogeneously across the population. In polarized networks, we observe a significantly more widespread diffusion of the virus, highlighting the importance of considering polarization for epidemic forecasting.</description>

      <title>From Brussels Effect to Gravity Assists: Understanding the Evolution of the GDPR-Inspired Personal Information Protection Law in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08237</link>

Abstract: This paper explores the evolution of China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and situates it within the context of global data protection development. It draws inspiration from the theory of 'Brussels Effect' and provides a critical account of its application in non-Western jurisdictions, taking China as a prime example. Our objective is not to provide a comparative commentary on China's legal development but to illuminate the intricate dynamics between the Chinese law and the EU's GDPR. We argue that the trajectory of China's Personal Information Protection Law calls into question the applicability of the Brussels Effect: while the GDPR's imprint on the PIPL is evident, a deeper analysis unveils China's nuanced, non-linear adoption that diverges from many assumptions of the Brussels Effect and similar theories. The evolution of the GDPR-inspired PIPL is not as a straightforward outcome of the Brussels Effect but as a nuanced, intricate interplay of external influence and domestic dynamics. We introduce a complementary theory of 'gravity assist', which portrays China's strategic instrumentalisation of the GDPR as a template to shape its unique data protection landscape. Our theoretical framework highlights how China navigates through a patchwork of internal considerations, international standards, and strategic choices, ultimately sculpting a data protection regime that has a similar appearance to the GDPR but aligns with its distinct political, cultural and legal landscape. With a detailed historical and policy analysis of the PIPL, coupled with reasonable speculations on its future avenues, our analysis presents a pragmatic, culturally congruent approach to legal development in China. It signals a trajectory that, while potentially converging at a principled level, is likely to diverge significantly in practice [...]</description>

      <title>Predictive Performance Comparison of Decision Policies Under Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive models are often introduced to decision-making tasks under the rationale that they improve performance over an existing decision-making policy. However, it is challenging to compare predictive performance against an existing decision-making policy that is generally under-specified and dependent on unobservable factors. These sources of uncertainty are often addressed in practice by making strong assumptions about the data-generating mechanism. In this work, we propose a method to compare the predictive performance of decision policies under a variety of modern identification approaches from the causal inference and off-policy evaluation literatures (e.g., instrumental variable, marginal sensitivity model, proximal variable). Key to our method is the insight that there are regions of uncertainty that we can safely ignore in the policy comparison. We develop a practical approach for finite-sample estimation of regret intervals under no assumptions on the parametric form of the status quo policy. We verify our framework theoretically and via synthetic data experiments. We conclude with a real-world application using our framework to support a pre-deployment evaluation of a proposed modification to a healthcare enrollment policy.</description>

      <title>AI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging $\unicode{x2013}$ which we define as "strategic underperformance on an evaluation". In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted, or password-locked, to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. Even more, we found that a capable password-locked model (Llama 3 70b) is reasonably able to emulate a less capable model (Llama 2 7b). Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.</description>
