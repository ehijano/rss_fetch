      <title>Inclusion of the Longitudinal Momentum-Transfer Component and Kinematic Factors in a diffraction approach for H(d,p)X Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of the Glauber-Sitenko approximation, an analysis of the differential cross section for deuteron breakup into a proton in the reaction H(d,p)X is presented. The study is carried out using various parameterizations of the deuteron wave function, including the single-Gaussian parametrization, the multi-Gaussian K2 parametrization, and models based on the Av18 and NijmI nucleon-nucleon potentials. Special attention is given to the effects of small longitudinal components of the transferred momentum (Qz &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) and the transverse momentum of the proton-neutron pair (p_perp &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) in the anti-laboratory reference frame. The results are compared with experimental data, particularly in the region of longitudinal momenta p\_3 = 0.25-0.5 GeV/c, where quark effects are expected to manifest. Preliminary estimates show a decrease in the cross section with increasing transverse momentum, as well as a relatively small shift (and growth) of the cross-section maximum due to the inclusion of the longitudinal component Qz.</description>

      <title>QED-enhanced PDF implications for the Higgs sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the implications of electroweak corrections beyond leading order for processes of special interest in the Higgs sector. We especially explore the role of these corrections given the introduction of an explicit parton distribution function (PDF) for the photon in the proton, an object which emerges necessarily in global PDF fits which include QED effects (i.e., QED-enhanced PDFs). We concentrate on several representative cases, including total Higgs-production cross sections through gluon fusion, $gg \to H$, vector-boson fusion (VBFH), and associated production, $pp \to VH$; we also examine differential distributions, taking a representative Higgs-strahlung process, $pp \to W^+H$. We find that the recently developed LUX formalism for the photon PDF significantly stabilizes the PDF dependence of both QED-PDF and electroweak corrections in the Higgs sector, while leaving overall $\sim\!3\!-\!4\%$ cross-section-level variations, depending on the chosen QED-enhanced PDF. We illustrate this QED-enhanced PDF dependence by exploring predictions based upon recent analyses of the CTEQ-TEA, MSHT, and NNPDF analysis groups, fitted either at NNLO or approximate N3LO in QCD.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and Dirac neutrino masses in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the scheme of Baryogenesis through Leptogenesis in the single flavor approximation, we emphasize the role of the Dirac neutrino mass $m_D$ in the SO(10) Grand Unification scheme, using the Higgs representations for the fermions masses ${\bf 10}$ and $\overline{\bf 126}$. Both representations are needed to get relations among the fermion masses, e.g. $m_b = m_\tau$, $m_\mu = 3 m_s$,... Taking these two representations allow to relax the condition $m_D = m_u$ obtained with the representation ${\bf 10}$ alone and to have general Dirac masses $m_D \not = m_u$. On the other hand, we assume that the antisymmetric representation ${\bf 120}$ is absent. Within this hypothesis, the unitary matrices $V^L$ and $V^R$ that diagonalize $m_D$ through $m_D = V^{L \dagger} m_D^{diag} V^R$ still satisfy the relation $V^R = V^{L*}$. Under these conditions, unlike the case of keeping only the ${\bf 10}$ representation, we obtain in parameter space several examples of the heavy neutrino spectrum consistent with the SO(10) unification scale, and a value for the baryon asymmetry $Y_B$ in agreement with data. For illustration, we detail a case that gives the heavy spectrum with masses $M_1 = 6.26 \times 10^{10}\ {\rm GeV}$, $M_2 = 2.23 \times 10^{12}\ {\rm GeV}$, $M_3 = 4.57 \times 10^{14}\ {\rm GeV}$ and, in the strong washout regime, the baryon asymmetry $Y_B = 8.50 \times 10^{-11}$ consistent with the data.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi+\gamma$ production in ultraperipheral ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of ions provide new opportunities to study the quarkonium production mechanism in photon-photon scattering. In this paper, we investigate the exclusive process $\gamma+\gamma\to J/\psi+\gamma$ up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s v^2)$ accuracy within the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics factorization framework. We evaluate the corresponding cross sections for Pb-Pb and p-p UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider. Numerical results show that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$, and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s v^2)$ corrections are about $-50\%$, $-33\%$, and $15\%$ of the leading-order (LO) contribution, respectively, showing reasonable convergence in both $\alpha_s$ and $v^2$ expansion. Collectively, these corrections suppress the LO cross section by a factor of about $1/3$, which is a crucial effect for reliable phenomenological analysis. Our results suggest that future experimental measurements of this process are feasible.</description>

      <title>Bounding exotic top decays inclusively at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its discovery, the top quark has never been produced and studied in an environment as clean as that predicted for $e^+e^-$ collisions at future colliders. Details of the top quark's properties, completely unattainable in hadronic collisions, can be analyzed via lepton collisions. New strategies for analyzing the physics of the top quark can, therefore, be developed in such a spectacularly clean environment. Here we focus on the possibility of inclusively measuring exotic excesses in the top decay width by studying the direct production of $t\bar t$ at the FCC-$ee$, thus establishing model-independent limits for rare decays branching fractions of the top quark.</description>

      <title>Characterizing radial flow fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the transverse-momentum differential radial flow fluctuations observable $v_0(p_T)$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC ($\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}{\,=\,}200$ GeV) and LHC ($\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}{\,=\,}2.76$ and 5.02 TeV) energies. Using a multistage hydrodynamic model, we assess the sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to a wide range of physical effects, including bulk and shear viscosities, off-equilibrium corrections at particlization, the presence of a hadronic afterburner, and the nucleon size in the initial conditions. By employing complementary rescaling strategies, we demonstrate how different physical effects leave distinct imprints on the shape of $v_0(p_T)$. A combined double-rescaling of $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ versus $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$ reveals a universality across a wide range of energies and model assumptions in the low-$p_T$ regime, a robust signature of collective behavior. This allows us to disentangle the universal dynamics of the bulk medium from model-specific features that emerge at higher $p_T$. Our results establish $v_0(p_T)$ as a powerful and complementary observable for constraining QGP transport properties and initial-state granularity, offering a unique probe of the created QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Bridging doubly heavy tetraquark mass spectrum with heavy baryons utilizing heavy antiquark-diquark symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, we present a systematic study of double heavy tetraquarks ($T_{QQ'\bar{q}\bar{q}'}$) using heavy antiquark-diquark symmetry (HADS) within a constituent quark model. By calibrating model parameters to known hadron spectra and incorporating the effective mass formula, we predict the masses for 38 ground-state tetraquarks with $cc$, $bb$, and $bc$ heavy quark pairs, including the non-strange, single-strange, and double-strange configurations with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+, 1^+$ and $2^+$. Notably, we identify several stable states below the relevant meson-meson thresholds, particularly in the $bb\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ sector. The explicit connection between doubly heavy tetraquark and heavy baryon spectra through HADS reduces model dependence and reveals fundamental systematics in the heavy-quark hadron landscape.</description>

      <title>Nonfactorizable charming loops in exclusive FCNC $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare (i) nonfactorizable charm-quark loops in exclusive FCNC B-decays and (ii) three-particle contributions to the amplitude of semileptonic B-decay. Both amplitudes are given in the heavy-quark limit, $m_b\to\infty$, by a convolution of a hard kernel and a three-particle wave function of the $B$-meson, $\langle 0|\bar q(x)G_{\mu\nu}(z) b(0)|B(p)\rangle$. An essential difference between the two amplitudes is that the amplitude of semileptonic $B$-decay involves this 3-particle wave function in a collinear light-cone configuration, whereas the amplitude of nonfactorizable charm in FCNC $B$-decays involves this 3-particle wave function in a double collinear light-cone configuration.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>Puzzle for the Vector Meson Threshold Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-statistics total cross sections for the vector meson photoproduction at the threshold: $\gamma p\to\omega p$ (from A2 at MAMI, ELPH, and CBELSA/TAPS), $\gamma p\to \phi p$ (from CLAS and LEPS), and $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ (from GlueX) allow one to extract the absolute value of vector meson nucleon scattering length using Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model. The ``young'' vector meson hypothesis may explain the fact that the obtained scattering length value for the nucleon $\phi$-meson compared to the typical hadron size of approximately $\sim1~\mathrm{fm}$ indicates that the proton is more transparent for the $\phi$-meson compared to the $\omega$-meson and is much less transparent than the $J/\psi$-meson. The extended analysis of $\Upsilon$-meson photoproduction using quasi-data from the QCD approach is in perfect agreement with the light-meson findings using experimental data.
  Future high-quality experiments by EIC and EicC will have the opportunity to evaluate cases for $J/\psi$- and $\Upsilon$-mesons. It allows one to understand the dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ production at the threshold. The ability of J-PARC to measure $\pi^- p\to \phi n$ and $\pi^-p\to J/\psi n$, which are free from the VMD model, is considered.</description>

      <title>Impact of Primordial Magnetic Fields on the First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study how the primordial magnetic field affects the first-order electroweak phase transition in the early Universe. We observe that: 1) the phase transition process would be slowed down by the magnetic field; 2) the phenomenon of vortex structure of the Higgs condensation appears when the homogenesis hypermagentic field $g'B_Y^{ex}/m_W^2\gtrsim3.63$; and, 3) the helical hypermagnetic field can dramatically enhance the sphaleron rate and validate the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EPOS4 is based on a sophisticated (recently significantly improved) parallel-primary-scattering scenario followed by a hydrodynamic expansion, for all collision systems, from small ones such as proton-proton ($pp$) to big ones such as lead-lead (PbPb). Having already reported on identified particle spectra in recent publications (providing information about radial flow), I discuss here the multiplicity dependence of multi-particle cumulants and flow harmonics, to better understand collectivity in small systems. The model is not particularly tuned for flow results, but it is a "general purpose" approach, trying to accommodate various types of observables with the same model.</description>

      <title>Investigating 1-Bit Quantization in Transformer-Based Top Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing scale of deep learning models in high-energy physics (HEP) has posed challenges to their deployment on low-power, latency-sensitive platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs used in trigger systems, as well as in offline data reconstruction and processing pipelines. In this work, we introduce BitParT, a 1-bit Transformer-based architecture designed specifically for the top-quark tagging method. Building upon recent advances in ultra-low-bit large language models (LLMs), we extended these ideas to the HEP domain by developing a binary-weight variant (BitParT) of the Particle Transformer (ParT) model. Our findings indicate a potential for substantial reduction in model size and computational complexity, while maintaining high tagging performance. We benchmark BitParT on the public Top Quark Tagging Reference Dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance relative to its full-precision counterpart. This work demonstrates the design of extreme quantized models for physics applications, paving the way for real-time inference in collider experiments with minimal and optimized resource usage.</description>

      <title>On phenomenological relations for masses and mixing parameters of quarks and leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative analysis of a number of phenomenological relationships between constants of the extended Standard Model of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions of fundamental particles (hereinafter referred to as the extended Standard Model) is carried out to detect possible correlations between constants in the quark and lepton sectors. The presence of such correlations may indicate connections between constants within a more general theory than the extended Standard Model. Phenomenological relationships between masses of current and constituent quarks and mixing angles are considered. A phenomenological relationship between neutrino masses and neutrino mixing angle is found. The quark-lepton complementarity relationship for quark and neutrino mixing angles is confirmed. A typical estimate of the accuracy of such relationships is given. Estimates of the masses of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos are obtained at the phenomenological level using the seesaw mechanism. In this case, it is assumed that the values of the active neutrino masses depend on three characteristic scales, and the sum of the active neutrino masses is limited from above by $0.06$~eV. An example of a grand unification theory and possible stages of spontaneous breaking of its gauge symmetry to the level of gauge symmetry of the extended Standard Model due to additional Higgs particles are considered.</description>

      <title>Partial pressure and susceptibilities of charmed sector in the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the general susceptibilities in the charm sector by using the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model (VDWHRG). We argue that the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG), which assumes no interactions between hadrons, and the excluded volume hadron resonance gas (EVHRG), which includes only repulsive interactions, fail to explain the lQCD data at very high temperatures. In contrast, the VDWHRG model, incorporating both attractive and repulsive interactions, extends the degree of agreement with lQCD up to nearly 180 MeV. We estimate the partial pressure in the charm sector and study charm susceptibility ratios in a baryon-rich environment, which is tricky for lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) due to the fermion sign problem. Our study further solidifies the notion that the hadrons shouldn't be treated as non-interacting particles, especially when studying higher order fluctuations, but rather one should consider both attractive and repulsive interactions between the hadrons.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of KDAR $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current scattering on carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino energy reconstruction is crucial for reducing systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments and improving cross-section measurements. Kaon-Decays-At-Rest (KDAR) neutrinos provide a unique opportunity to probe neutrino-nucleus interactions at low energies with a precisely known energy of 235.5 MeV. This work presents Monte Carlo predictions of missing energy due to nuclear effects in the KDAR $\nu_\mu$ charged-current scattering on the carbon nucleus for JSNS$^2$. The predictions from GENIE, NuWro, and GiBUU show a significant impact of nuclear and final state interaction (FSI) models, as well as nucleon removal energy, on missing energy reconstruction. Tuning the hA FSI model improves the predictions from GENIE. It is also observed that the nucleon elastic component of FSI leads to better predictions in NuWro compared to GENIE. NuWro shows the best agreement with data among the generators considered; however, the observed discrepancies with data across all generators highlight the limitations of current theoretical descriptions in the low-energy regime and the need for improvements in Monte Carlo modeling.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>Light baryonium states with exotic quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of baryonium-bound or resonant states composed of a baryon and an antibaryon-has long been postulated as a natural extension of conventional hadron spectroscopy. In the present work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the mass spectrum and internal configurations of light baryonium candidates exhibiting exotic quantum numbers that are inaccessible within the framework of the traditional quark model. Employing the method of QCD sum rules, we analyze nucleon-antinucleon and light hyperon-anti-hyperon systems with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $0^{+-}$, which are quantum number combinations prohibited for conventional mesonic states. Our analysis reveals the potential existence of two $0^{--}$ $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ baryonium states with masses $(2.90\pm0.09)$ GeV and $(3.36\pm0.09)$ GeV, respectively, as well as two $0^{+-}$ $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ states with masses $(2.91\pm0.07)$ GeV and $(3.29\pm0.07)$ GeV, respectively. In addition, corresponding nucleon-antinucleon partner states are identified at $(2.69\pm0.07)$ GeV, $(3.07\pm0.08)$ GeV, $(2.86\pm0.07)$ GeV, and $(3.22\pm0.07)$ GeV, respectively. Furthermore, analogous $\Xi$-$\bar{\Xi}$ configurations are predicted with masses of $(3.10\pm0.09)$ GeV, $(3.54\pm0.07)$ GeV, $(3.08\pm0.08)$ GeV, and $(3.45\pm0.08)$ GeV, respectively. The possible decay modes of the light exotic baryonium states are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in BESIII, BELLEII, and LHCb experiments.</description>

Abstract: A highly predictive neutrino mass matrix texture is proposed. The texture is minimal and carries two interesting correlations. It gives precise and unambiguous answers to almost all the current issues related to observable parameters in neutrino phenomenology. The texture is developed in a framework of type-I + type-II seesaw mechanisms with an extended group structure of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times A_4 \times Z_{10} \times Z_{7} \times Z_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Chiral enhancement in soft-photon bremsstrahlung and charge asymmetry in low-energy lepton-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a Lorentz gauge evaluation of the single-soft photon bremsstrahlung radiative corrections to the unpolarized elastic lepton-proton scattering cross section at low energies using the framework of heavy baryon chiral effective field theory (HB$\chi$PT). We systematically incorporate all next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\mathcal O}(\alpha^3/M)$] contributions to the cross section arising from radiative and proton's low-energy recoil effects. An important component of the soft-photon bremsstrahlung corrections arises from the interference between lepton and proton bremsstrahlung processes, which are characterized as charge-odd. We identify a class of Feynman diagrams involving the final-state radiating proton that induces a chiral enhancement, thereby modifying the naive amplitude hierarchy based on the standard chiral power-counting scheme. The recently derived HB$\chi$PT result for the analytically computed exact two-photon exchange (TPE) counterpart at NLO is combined with our charge-odd soft-photon bremsstrahlung contribution to yield the complete charge-odd radiative correction. By incorporating the leading hadronic correction to the leading order Born one-photon exchange (OPE) process within the charge-even radiative correction, we obtain a prediction for the charge asymmetry observable, which can be compared with forthcoming MUSE data on elastic lepton-anti-lepton scattering off the proton. In all our calculations, we use finite lepton masses.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Gravitational Waves from Anisotropic Axion Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a powerful probe of the early universe due to their ability to free-stream across cosmic history. We study GW production in a compelling scenario where a rotating axion(-like) field becomes relevant for a brief period in the early universe before transitioning into a kination fluid and rapidly dissipating its energy through cosmic expansion. During this short epoch, the curvature perturbation can be predominantly sourced by the rotating axion and may significantly exceed the adiabatic component. Moreover, axion field perturbations grow on superhorizon scales during this phase. These effects can generate a strong stochastic background of induced GWs. This GW background also exhibits a pronounced large-scale anisotropy inherited from the axion fluctuations, serving as a distinctive signature of the scenario. Importantly, the transient nature of axion relevance enables this scenario to evade stringent bounds on large-scale perturbations. We analyze various observational constraints and find that both the amplitude and anisotropy of the resulting GW signal could be accessible to future detectors.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Parity-violating Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.</description>

      <title>EPOS.LHC-R : a global approach to solve the muon puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadron production in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models re-tuned after early LHC data give more consistent results among each other compared to the first generation of models, but still can't reproduce extended air shower data (EAS) consistently resulting in the so-called "muon puzzle". Using more recent LHC data like in the QGSJET-III model improve further the description of EAS by such a model but is not enough to resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground). Using the EPOS LHC-R model, the detailed changes will be addressed and their consequences on EAS observable at various energies.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

      <title>Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Preheating and gravitational waves in large-field hilltop inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.</description>

Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>

      <title>Leading-Order QCD Equation of State in Strong Magnetic Fields at Nonzero Baryon Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present continuum-estimated $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD results for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state in strong magnetic fields and at nonzero baryon chemical potential. Simulations employ the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on lattices of temporal extent $N_\tau = 8,\,12$, covering $145 \lesssim T \lesssim 165~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \lesssim 0.8~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing strangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon number ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and $s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure coefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\rm B}$, and energy-like coefficients $\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\epsilon_2$ (energy density), and $\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce temperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in the energy-like coefficients, with $\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly vanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the pressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence, finding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field enhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for neutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear deviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide useful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in strong magnetic fields at finite baryon density.</description>

      <title>Thermo-coalescence model for Light Nuclei production in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a hybrid approach to describe the light nuclei production mechanism where the nucleons are assumed to be thermally produced, and are allowed to form light nuclei using a coalescence prescription. In this approach, we first fit transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distribution of nucleons using hydro-inspired boost-invariant blast-wave model. The extracted parameters are then used to describe the deuteron $p_{T}$ spectra, along with two additional parameters that characterize the coalescence prescription employed in this study. We refer this combined approach as ``thermo-coalescence model'' and it is designed to study the deuteron production and describe the experimental measurements. In this work, we analyze the measured $p_{T}$ distribution of protons and deuterons from Pb-Pb collisions at the ALICE Collaboration at LHC. We also evaluate the $p_{T}$-integrated deuteron yields using this approach and compare with experimental measurements. A Bayesian inference framework is employed to determine the best-fit parameters of the thermo-coalescence model. Finally, we estimate the traditionally used experimental coalescence parameter ($B_{A}$) within our framework in order to establish a connection between our model and the conventional coalescence approach commonly used to relate experimental data with theoretical descriptions of light nuclei production.</description>

      <title>Topological Strings in SU(3) Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_3$ center symmetry. These configurations form at the junctions of domain walls of the theory. The complex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\pi$ on large spatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy associated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices with spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\tau=2$. Our results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the domain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the decay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic form factors of heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons</title>

Abstract: We systematically investigate the electromagnetic form factors of heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons within the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equations framework for the first time. It is found that the charge radius of vector meson is larger than that of its pseudo-scalar counterpart. In heavy-light systems, the flavor symmetry breaking will lead to a splitting of the form factor of different quark, and the distribution range of lighter and heavier quark gradually expands and contracts, respectively. The competition between them together generates the electromagnetic form factors of meson. Our results can be compared with other theoretical calculations and future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, the CDF Collaboration reported a precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, which deviates from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, $M_W^{\rm SM}=80.357\pm0.006~\mathrm{GeV}$, by about $7\sigma$. By contrast, the CMS Collaboration obtained $M_W=80.3602\pm0.0099~\mathrm{GeV}$, very close to the SM global electroweak fit value of $\sim80.357~\mathrm{GeV}$. Motivated by this situation, we reassess the $W$-boson mass within the Lepton-Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM). We perform random scans (generated with SARAH 4.13.0 and evaluated with SPheno 4.0.3) and confront the results with up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. In the LS-2HDM, if $h_1$ is the SM-like Higgs at $m_{h_1}\simeq125$ GeV with $|\cos(\beta-\alpha)|\lesssim0.06$, $17\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim39$, $144\lesssim m_{h_2}\lesssim414$ GeV, and $435\lesssim m_{A,H^{\pm}}\lesssim685$ GeV, the model reproduces the 2024 CMS $W$-boson mass within $3\sigma$. Solutions near the 2022 CDF value, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, survive; however, after applying all constraints, including HiggsTools, they approach it at best within $\lesssim2\sigma$. In regions consistent with the CDF results, $h_1$ is SM-like at $m_{h_1}\simeq125$ GeV with $|\cos(\beta-\alpha)|\lesssim0.07$, $15\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim25$, $246\lesssim m_{h_2}\lesssim253$ GeV, and $560\lesssim m_{A,H^{\pm}}\lesssim634$ GeV. In this case, the mass difference between the charged and CP-odd Higgs bosons satisfies $15\lesssim m_{H^\pm}-m_A\lesssim75$ GeV, whereas CMS-consistent regions allow $-40\lesssim m_{H^\pm}-m_A\lesssim160$ GeV. LFU deviations in $Z$ and $\tau$ decays remain small and compatible with current averages, and CDF-compatible solutions correlate with a positive $T$ parameter at $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$.</description>

      <title>A model for Axial Non-Standard Interactions of neutrinos with quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino oscillation experiments are setting increasingly strong upper bounds on the vector Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI) with matter fields. However, the bounds on the axial NSI are more relaxed, raising the hope that studying the neutral current events at an experiment such as DUNE can give a glimpse on new physics. We build a model that gives rise to axial NSI with large couplings leading to observable deviation from the standard prediction at DUNE. The model is based on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with a gauge boson of mass $\sim 30$~GeV which can be discovered at the high luminosity LHC. Combining the LHC and DUNE discoveries, we can unravel the axial form of interaction. The cancellation of anomalies of the gauge group suggests new heavy quarks as well as a dark matter candidate. The new quarks mixed with the first generation quarks can also be discovered at the LHC. Moreover, they provide a seesaw mechanism that explains the smallness of the $u$ and $d$ quark masses. The dark matter has an axial coupling to the quarks which makes its discovery via spin dependent direct dark matter search experiments possible.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy collisions far above the electroweak scale, the effects of electroweak symmetry breaking are expected to become parametrically small $\delta \sim M_W/E$. This defines the extent to which the electroweak gauge symmetry is restored: $(i)$ the physics of the transverse gauge bosons and fermions is described by a massless theory in the unbroken phase; $(ii)$ the longitudinal gauge bosons behave like the Goldstone bosons and join the Higgs boson to restore the unbroken $O(4)$ symmetry in the original Higgs sector. Using the unique feature of the radiation amplitude zeros in gauge theory, we propose to study the electroweak symmetry restoration quantitatively by examining the processes for the gauge boson pair production $W^\pm \gamma,\ W^\pm Z$ and $W^\pm H$ at the LHC and muon colliders.</description>

Abstract: In this analysis, we examine the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon pairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV and has an integrated luminosity of 4 ab\(^{-1}\). Our focus is on the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) variable, which is defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by the Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a notable forward-backward asymmetry. However, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) distribution. This angular distribution can be valuable for distinguishing between these models, especially in the event of observing excesses beyond the Standard Model expectations. We utilized the mono-Z\(^{\prime}\) model to interpret the simulated data. In the absence of any discoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the masses of various particles in the model, which includes the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and fermionic dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the kinematically allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong transitions in all the light and heavy sectors. We consider only the ground state on-shell particles in the baryonic and mesonic channels. In the case of mesons, only the well-established pseudoscslar and vector nonets are involved. For the baryons, we consider the ground state spin 1/2 and 3/2 baryons. Using all the restrictions and conservation laws, a \texttt{mathematica}/ \texttt{python} code selects the allowed strong channels among many possible transitions. Using the strong coupling constants defining these transitions, we estimate the strong width and beaching fraction at each channel, that may help ongoing experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Distribution amplitudes of heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons from Dyson-Schwinger equations framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first Dyson-Schwinger equation predictions for the leading-twist distribution amplitudes of the $B^*$, $B_s^*$, and $B_c^*$ mesons, and extend the investigation to a broader set of heavy-light pseudo-scalar/vector mesons. Numerical analysis shows that, in flavor-asymmetric systems, the distribution amplitude is skewed toward the heavier quark, with the position of the maximum $\sim M^f_E/(M^f_E+M^g_E)$, where $M_E$ is the Euclidean constituent quark mass and $f$, $g$ denote the quark flavors. Spin effects are found to be subleading compared to the influence of valence-quark composition, and lead to heavier quarks carrying more light-front momentum in vector mesons than in their pseudo-scalar counterparts. Our results can be compared with both experimental and theoretical outcomes in the future.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Di-Higgs and Effective Field Theory: Signal Reweighting Beyond $m_{hh}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Di-Higgs ($hh$) production is crucial for probing the Higgs boson self-interaction and understanding the electroweak phase transition. Deviations from Standard Model predictions in $hh$ gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) can be systematically parameterized using effective field theories (EFT), such as Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), as long as the conditions of the EFT are fulfilled. This note presents an improved EFT signal reweighting method that addresses the limitations of approaches that rely solely on the invariant mass of the di-Higgs system $m_{hh}$, which fail to capture variations in kinematic variables such as the Higgs boson transverse momentum. We show that these limitations are particularly pronounced in scenarios involving strong destructive interference. The proposed method is developed for both EFTs for $hh$ ggF at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV at next-to-leading order in QCD. We demonstrate a reweighting technique that combines more than one EFT reference sample while incorporating multiple key variables of ggF. These enhancements improve accuracy across phase space, particularly in capturing variation of the Higgs boson transverse momentum. The method employs a convex combination of the reference samples, with weights parametrized by a distance measure, to achieve a more precise reweighting. In principle, this approach can be extended to other processes, provided that suitable reference samples and distance measure are carefully chosen.</description>

      <title>$D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing in the Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of difficulty to reproduce observables in the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing via the operator product expansion, we discuss the Dyson-Schwinger approach to this process. Formulated by the parametrization of quark propagators, SU(3) breaking relevant to charm mixing is evaluated in such a way that properly takes account of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The $\bar{D}^0\to D^0$ transition is discussed in the vacuum-insertion approximation with locality of the light valence-quark field, represented by the decay constant of $D^0$ meson as well as relevant momentum integrals. It is found that dimensionless mass-difference observable in this approach leads to $|x|=(1.3-2.9)\times 10^{-3}$, the order of magnitude comparable to the HFLAV data, and thereby offering a certain improvement as a theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Weakly supervised anomaly detection with event-level variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new topology for weakly supervised anomaly detection searches, di-object plus~X. In this topology, one looks for a resonance decaying to two standard model particles produced in association with other anomalous event activity (X). This additional activity is used for classification. We demonstrate how anomaly detection techniques which have been developed for di-jet searches focusing on jet substructure anomalies can be applied to event-level anomaly detection in this topology. To robustly capture event-level features of multi-particle kinematics, we employ new physically motivated variables derived from the geometric structure of a collision's phase space manifold. As a proof of concept, we explore the application of this approach to several benchmark signals in the di-$\tau$ and di-$\mu$ plus~X final states. We demonstrate that our anomaly detection approach can reach discovery-level significances for signals that would be missed in a conventional bump-hunt approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of the neutrino spin-flavor precession in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin-flavor precession of neutrinos in a magnetic field within the quantum field theory approach in which neutrinos are virtual particles. Neutrinos are taken to be Majorana particles having a nonzero transition magnetic moment. We derive the dressed propagators of the neutrino mass eigenstates exactly accounting for the magnetic field contribution. The matrix element and the transition probability for the spin-flavor precession are obtained in the approximation of the forwardly scattered charged leptons. The leading term in the transition probability is shown to coincide with the result of the standard quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations. We also discuss the quantum field theory contributions to the neutrino dressed propagators and demonstrate that these contributions result in a small correction to the transition probability. The case of charged leptons with arbitrary energies is considered.</description>

Abstract: We study the spin-entangled mixed state of a spin-1/2 baryon-antibaryon pair produced in the process e+e- to J/psi, psi(2S) to BBbar. We demonstrate that the spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B to b + M and Bbar to bbar + Mbar, where b and bbar are spin-1/2 baryons and M, Mbar are spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation, represents a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay process. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that it depends only on the initial state of the BBbar system and the decay parameter alphaD, but not on the phase parameter phiD.</description>

Abstract: High-energy proton-nucleus (pA) collisions offer valuable insight into the role of cold nuclear matter effects in hadron production. In particular, multiple rescatterings of an incoming parton by the nuclear target are known to induce the radiation of many soft gluons. Hadron production is affected by fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), owing to those radiated gluons with a long formation time. Here we present a recently derived formula for the induced single soft gluon radiation spectrum beyond leading logarithmic accuracy, whose main features are demonstrated with the example of $q\, g \to q\, g$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Moat regimes within a $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-quark-meson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand recent predictions on the moat regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter, this paper extends the previous work within the two-flavor quark-meson (QM) model to the more realistic $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-quark-meson (PQM) model. Mainly, two effects are further taken into account: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model parameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudocritical temperature from lattice QCD, $T_{\rm C}\sim 156~ {\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical potential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\mu_{\rm B(CEP)}\sim 635~ {\rm MeV}$. It is found that the basic features of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons remain similar to those from QM model: Moat regimes cover the region where temperature or baryon chemical potential is large; reentrances occur around the critical baryon chemical potential of chiral transition at zero temperature. Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\mu_{\rm B}$ plane. The moat regime and pole energy of $K$ mesons are also studied with the features similar.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, we perform a detailed study of neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from strongly magnetized, dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\mu_{f} T)$ approaches zero, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission, but the total rate vanishes as $B\to 0$. In the opposite limit, where the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed due to Landau-level quantization, which limits the thermal activation of quarks near the Fermi surface. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $\Sigma^*$ via isospin selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isospin-selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$ provides a clean probe for investigating $I=1$ $\Sigma^*$ resonances. In this work, we perform an analysis of this reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach for the first time, incorporating the well-established $\Sigma(1189) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1385) 3/2^+$, $\Sigma(1670) 3/2^-$, $\Sigma(1775) 5/2^-$ states, while also exploring contributions from other unestablished states. By fitting the available differential cross section and recoil polarization data, adhering to partial-wave phase conventions same as PDG, we find that besides the established resonances, contributions from $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$ and a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ improve the description. Notably, a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ resonance with mass around 1.54 GeV, consistent with $\Sigma(1620)1/2^-$, is found to be essential for describing the data in this channel, a stronger indication than found in previous analyses focusing on $\pi\Lambda$ final states. While providing complementary support for $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$ and $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$, our results highlight the importance of the $\Sigma(1620) 1/2^-$ region in $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$. Future high-precision measurements are needed to solidify these findings and further constrain the $\Sigma^*$ spectrum.</description>

The statistical significance of the ${\psi(2\mathrm S)}$ pole reaches values between 3.7$\sigma$ and 4.9$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Classical Analysis of Non-Coherent Dark Matter to Photon Conversion in a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both axion and dark photon dark matter are among the most promising candidates of dark matter. What we know with some confidence is that they exhibit a small velocity distribution $\delta v\lesssim v\sim 10^{-3}$c. In addition, their mass is small, resulting in a long de Broglie wavelength and a high particle number density. Their phase space distribution contains many uncertainties, so they could give rise to either a coherent or noncoherent wave on the laboratory scale. In this paper, we demonstrated that a resonant cavity can enhance noncoherent axion-to-photon or dark photon-to-photon transitions, and the resulting power is the same as in the coherence case. The classical picture explanation is that a cavity can resonant with multiple different sources simultaneously. This aligns with the quantum perspective, where the cavity boosts dark matter particles transitioning into photons similarly to the Purcell effect. This effect increases the density of states near resonance, regardless of the coherence nature of dark matter. Certainly, the induced microwave signals in a cavity are also non-coherent, and in such case, a single-photon readout may be required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon-nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0-17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$-10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of QCD radiation in off-shell Higgs production through gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the Higgs boson width is a critical test of the Standard Model, with significant implications for understanding electroweak symmetry breaking. Direct measurements are limited by detector resolution, but it can be measured with greater precision through a combined analysis of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production. While results for on-shell production have been computed to a very high accuracy, theoretical predictions for off-shell Higgs boson production are not as well controlled due to the breakdown of the heavy-top approximation and the large interference with non-resonant amplitudes. Seeking to understand and improve the theoretical control, we compare leading-order and next-to-leading-order plus parton shower differential cross-sections for signal, background, and full physical processes in off-shell Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider, using Powheg, MadGraph, and Sherpa. We analyze the impact of higher-order quantum chromodynamics effects and theoretical uncertainties, highlighting differences between predictions using jet merging with parton showers, and those from next-to-leading order computations matched to parton showers. The results provide insights for improving theoretical predictions and their application to experimental measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with an eye toward its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are supposed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion.The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of the so-called spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

Abstract: Using the most recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavour chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Transition GPDs for Delta(1232) from Helicity Amplitude A_1/2(Q^2) via Dipole Fits and Impact Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular reconstruction of the transition generalized parton distribution (GPD) H_T(x,t) for the Delta(1232) resonance, based on digitized helicity amplitude data and dipole fits to A_1/2(Q^2). From the fitted amplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a separable GPD model H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized Beta-like profile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and enables a direct two-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse spatial distributions q(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates transverse localization, and quantify spatial features using statistical diagnostics including mean radius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is reproducible, data-driven, and applicable to other transition channels, providing a physically interpretable map from amplitude behavior to spatial structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim T_0\sim 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact version of the Schwinger Proper Time Renormalisation Group flow equation from first principles from the complete path integral, without using any perturbative expansion. We study the advantages of this flow equation as compared to the canonical Exact Renormalisation Group flow equation, which uses a regulator in momentum space. We use our flow equation to recover the convexity of the effective scalar potential in the IR limit and apply it to the study of false-vacuum decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel application of computer vision techniques to extract beyond the Standard Model parameters directly from high energy physics flavor data. We propose a novel data representation that transforms the angular and kinematic distributions into ``quasi-images", which are used to train a convolutional neural network to perform regression tasks, similar to fitting. As a proof-of-concept, we train a 34-layer Residual Neural Network to regress on these images and determine information about the Wilson Coefficient $C_{9}$ in Monte Carlo simulations of $B^0 \rightarrow K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays. The method described here can be generalized and may find applicability across a variety of experiments.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in dense quark matter environments: A chiral model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <title>Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards as a Robust Test on Late-Time Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an assumption-minimized framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-Universe biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case. If this shift is physical, it may result from the omission of some pre-recombination physical processes that influence the scale dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlight the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a causality analysis on the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics with spin well as shear and bulk viscosity, including the relaxation times for all these quantities. We find that the interplay of the three relaxational scales, for shear and bulk viscosity as well as polarization, leads to non-trivial effects on the dispersion relation. Unexpectedly, the presence of polarization leads to lower effective viscosity and a longer relaxation time, and the presence of viscosity leads to lower limits as well as upper ones on the group velocity and constraints relating polarization to viscosity relaxation times. We conclude with a qualitative discussion on how these results impact phenomenology, specifically the low effective viscosity in strongly interacting matter as well as shear-vorticity coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two dimension, and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $N-J/\psi$ Interaction from an Operator Product Expansion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent lattice QCD study has shown that the $N-J/\psi$ potential is attractive at all distances, and its long-range tail is well described by two-pion exchange. Here, we study to what extent the long-range part of the attraction can be reproduced from the perspective of the operator product expansion (OPE). This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of four-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter on the masses of the $J/\psi$ and other mesons composed of heavy quarks.</description>
