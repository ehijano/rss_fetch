      <title>Autonomous Station Keeping of Satellites in Areostationary Mars Orbit: A Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continued exploration of Mars will require a greater number of in-space assets to aid interplanetary communications. Future missions to the surface of Mars may be augmented with stationary satellites that remain overhead at all times as a means of sending data back to Earth from fixed antennae on the surface. These areostationary satellites will experience several important disturbances that push and pull the spacecraft off of its desired orbit. Thus, a station-keeping control strategy must be put into place to ensure the satellite remains overhead while minimizing the fuel required to elongate mission lifetime. This paper develops a model predictive control policy for areostationary station keeping that exploits knowledge of non-Keplerian perturbations in order to minimize the required annual station-keeping $\Delta v$. The station-keeping policy is applied to a satellite placed at various longitudes, and simulations are performed for an example mission at a longitude of a potential future crewed landing site. Through careful tuning of the controller constraints, and proper placement of the satellite at stable longitudes, the annual station-keeping $\Delta v$ can be reduced relative to a naive mission design.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Drag Sail Module for LEO Satellites: Implementation and Early Testing of AirDragMod (ADM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space debris has become a critical issue, with debris in orbit surpassing active satellites, posing significant risks to space sustainability. Payloads or rocket bodies discarded post-mission in LEO without orbital control are major sources. The IADC guidelines recommend limiting post-mission presence in protected regions to 25 years. The FCC recently introduced stricter regulations, reducing the allowable post-mission stay for LEO satellites to 5 years. These changes necessitate integrating deorbiting systems into satellite designs. However, adding extra fuel and engines for active deorbiting presents challenges due to LEO satellites' mass and volume limitations, especially for large constellations or CubeSats. This often leads to prioritizing mission-critical components over deorbiting systems. Thus, alternative approaches like passive deorbiting techniques or international regulations are explored. Drag sails are a cost-effective passive solution for small and medium-sized LEO satellites. This paper proposes a plug-and-play drag sail module using COTS components for CubeSats and sub-mass satellites. The scalable design is derived from mission requirements and trajectory analysis. The technique includes active control for quicker deorbiting at specific orbital LTAN. Inspired by JAXA's IKAROS mission, the deployment mechanism uses residual angular momentum and follows a standard sequence. A cost analysis estimates the system's breakeven point. A prototype with a 3D-printed deployment system and inverted stepper motor was tested and compared to a numerical model. A tension model for sail extension petals was developed using curve fitting from test data. SIMULINK multibody models are available for simulations. Further experimentation and prototype development are required to assess real-world performance, with a control system identified as crucial.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>
