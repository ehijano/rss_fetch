      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy, Dual Spacetime, and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss possible consequences of a manifestly non-commutative and $T$-duality covariant formulation of string theory on dark energy, when the correspondence between short distance (UV) and long distance (IR) physics is taken into account. We demonstrate that the dark energy is dynamical, \textit{i.e.}, time-dependent, and we compute the allowed values of $w_0$ and $w_a$, given by $w(a) = w_0+w_a(1-a)$, which compare favorably to the most recent observations by DESI. From this point of view, the latest results from DESI might point to a fundamentally new understanding of quantum spacetime in the context of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Additivity, Haag duality, and non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.</description>

      <title>The gravitational index and allowable complex metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Konstevich--Segal--Witten criterion for allowable complex metrics, in the context of the gravitational path integral corresponding to the supersymmetric index. In various theories of supergravity in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS space, the exponential growth of states of the corresponding microscopic index in string theory is known to be captured by complex saddle points of this path integral. We compare the KSW criterion for these complex saddles against constraints from geometric consistency and the convergence of microscopic indices for the same saddles. In all four-dimensional situations we find that the three criteria precisely agree with each other. However, in the AdS$_5$ dual to the superconformal index with unequal chemical potentials for the two angular momenta, we find that this agreement does not hold. The region of convergence of microscopic index in parameter space is a strict subset of the region allowed by the KSW criterion, which in turn is a strict subset of the geometric consistency conditions. We conclude that the KSW criterion is necessary but not sufficient for the allowability of complex metrics contributing to the superconformal index.</description>

      <title>On The Black Hole Weak Gravity Conjecture and Extremality in the Strong-Field Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) implies that sufficiently small extremal black holes are necessarily in the strong-field regime of electrodynamics, and therefore probe the UV completion of the Maxwell sector. To investigate the WGC bounds arising from these small extremal black holes, we revisit black hole decay in generic field theories in asymptotic flat space. We show that a general, sufficient condition for any black hole to decay is a bound on charge growth as a function of mass. We apply this decay condition to extremal black holes derived in some UV completions of the Maxwell sector. We find that the Euler-Heisenberg and DBI effective actions satisfy the charge growth bound, while the ModMax model does not, making it incompatible with the weak gravity conjecture. We show that the charge growth bound implies positivity of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling beta function. This provides an independent argument that classically stable (embedded-Abelian) colored black holes cannot exist. The charge growth bound constrains conformal hidden sector models, and is always satisfied in their AdS dual realizations.</description>

      <title>The landscape of complexity measures in 2D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the broad landscape of holographic complexity measures for theories dual to two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. Previous studies have largely focused on the complexity=volume and complexity=action proposals for holographic complexity. Here we systematically construct and analyze a wide class of generalized complexity functionals, focusing on codimension-one bulk observables. Two complementary approaches are presented: one inspired by dimensional reduction of codimension-one observables from higher-dimensional gravity, and another that adopts a purely 2D perspective. We verify the resulting observables exhibit hallmark features of complexity, such as linear growth at late times and the switchback effect. We further offer heuristic interpretations of the role of multiple extremal surfaces when they appear. Finally, we comment on the bulk-to-boundary dictionary via the covariant Peierls bracket in 2D gravity. Our work lays the groundwork for a richer understanding of quantum complexity in low-dimensional holographic dualities.</description>

      <title>Homotopy kinematic algebras at null infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first formulation of a homotopy algebra adapted to a $1/r$ expansion near future null infinity ($\mathcal{I^+}$). Focusing on self-dual Yang-Mills theory in Bondi coordinates, we demonstrate that imposing the homotopy algebra relations naturally yields the physically consistent fall-off behavior of the fields near $\mathcal{I^+}$. Furthermore, we employ this framework to systematically construct kinematic algebras, uncovering novel infinite families of such algebras that satisfy the Jacobi identity on slices near $\mathcal{I^+}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the most general $G_2$-invariant ${\rm AdS}_4$ vacua in 11 dimensional supergravity preserving 4 real supercharges, with the goal of understanding the IR fixed points of the RG flow induced by the cubic deformation of the ABJM theory. We identify a new $G_2$-invariant background, which completes the web of RG flows connecting its holographic dual with the ABJM theory and the (cubic analogue of) mass-deformed ABJM theory with SU(3)$\times$U(1) isometry. Our holographic study gives non-trivial predictions for the strongly-coupled field theory dual.</description>

      <title>Modular Time Evolution and the QNEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an inequality restricting the evolution of states in quantum field theory with respect to the modular flow of a wedge, $\Delta^{is}$, for large $|s|$. Our bound is related to the quantum null energy condition, QNEC. In one interpretation, it can be seen as providing a ``chaos-bound'' $\le 2\pi$ on the Lyapunov exponent with respect to Rindler time, $s$. Mathematically, our inequality is a statement about half-sided modular inclusions of von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Amplitude from crossing-symmetric celestial OPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the existence of crossing symmetric celestial OPE, we propose a method to reconstruct four-point massless scattering amplitudes in the framework of celestial holography. This method relies only on CFT techniques and a remarkable property: scattering amplitudes can be derived from a single conformal block coefficient in celestial CFT. Utilizing this method, we reconstruct the MHV amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, pure gravity, and Einstein-Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Gauging $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of Narain CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry in lattice conformal field theories (CFTs), also known as Narain CFTs. For prime $N$, we derive a spin selection rule for operators in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ charge-twisted sector of a general bosonic CFT. Using this result, we formulate the gauging procedures in lattice CFTs as modifications of the momentum lattices by a lattice vector that specifies a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. Applying this formulation to code CFTs, i.e., Narain CFTs constructed from error-correcting codes, we express the torus partition functions of the orbifolded and parafermionized theories in terms of the weight enumerator polynomials of the underlying codes. As an application, we identify a class of codes that yield self-dual bosonic CFTs under the orbifolding by a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric solutions of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eleven-dimensional supergravity has a non-relativistic variant obtained by taking a limit associated with the M2 brane. Consistency of this non-relativistic supergravity requires constraints. There is one choice of constraints which keeps the maximal amount of supersymmetry transformations, and another which only keeps half. I discuss supersymmetric solutions of this theory, based on limits of the M2 and M5 solutions. These limits involve either a scaling of the number of branes or a smearing in certain directions, and have been argued to produce non-Lorentzian bulk geometries appearing in novel versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence.I show that the scaled solutions are solutions of the maximally supersymmetric version of the non-relativistic supergravity, while the smeared solutions only give solutions of the half-maximally supersymmetric version. I show these solutions are all supersymmetric by solving the Killing spinor equations, and discuss usual and unusual forms of supersymmetry enhancement. I also discuss a simple supersymmetric AdS_3 background, and point out that the BTZ black hole is a solution of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity.</description>

      <title>Effective action for $\phi^4$-Yukawa theory via 2PI formalism in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction, coupled to fermions via the Yukawa interaction in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime background. The scalar has a classical background plus quantum fluctuations, whereas the fermions are taken to be quantum. We derive for this system the effective action and the effective potential via the two particle irreducible (2PI) formalism. This formalism provides an opportunity to find out resummed, non-perturbative results. We have considered the two loop vacuum graphs and have computed the local part of the effective action. The various resummed counterterms corresponding to self energies, vertex functions and the tadpole have been explicitly found. The variation of the renormalised effective potential for massless fields has been investigated numerically. We show that for the potential to be bounded from below, we must have $\lambda \gtrsim 16 g^2$, where $\lambda$ and $g$ are respectively the quartic and Yukawa couplings. We emphasise the qualitative differences of this non-perturbative calculation with that of the standard perturbative ones in de Sitter. The qualitative differences of our result with that of the flat spacetime has also been pointed out.</description>

      <title>On the geometric origin of the energy-momentum tensor improvement terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a flat background, the canonical energy momentum tensor of Lorentz and conformally invariant matter field theories can be improved to a symmetric and traceless tensor that gives the same conserved charges. We argue that the geometric origin of this improvement process is unveiled when the matter theory is coupled to Metric-Affine Gravity. In particular, we show that the Belinfante-Rosenfeld improvement terms correspond to the matter theory's hypermomentum. The improvement terms in conformally invariant matter theories are also related to the hypermomentum however a general proof would require an extended investigation. We demonstrate our results through various examples, such as the free massless scalar, the Maxwell field, Abelian $p$-forms, the Dirac field and a non-unitary massless scalar field. Possible applications of our method for theories that break Lorentz or special conformal invariance are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Four-twist effects on excitations in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric orbifold CFTs contain twist operators that can join and split copies of the CFT. In this paper, we study the effects of four twist-2 operators on two copies of a single free boson. A recent study analyzed their effects on the vacuum, finding a nontrivial left-right mixing that arises from the fact that the covering surface is a torus, while the effects of one or two twist-2 operators do not produce such mixing. Here, we extend this analysis to excited states and find a similar left-right mixing. Furthermore, we explore the continuum, or high-energy, limit and show that the left-right mixing becomes negligible in this limit.</description>

Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\pi$. We examine the physics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts such as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light of the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the physics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and the conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel approximations for $1/\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series motivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators to find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed for string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in the new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire contribution to $1/\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting at a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation gives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.</description>

      <title>Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and Geometric Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and Galilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with electric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond to both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric framework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime geometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Symmetries in a 4D Field-Theoretic Model: Symmetry Operators and Their Algebraic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we show the existence of (i) a couple of off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) BRST and co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) a full set of non-nilpotent (i.e. bosonic) symmetry transformations for an appropriate Lagrangian density that describes the combined system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories in the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensions of the flat Minkowskian spacetime. We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above continuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the algebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry operators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our present endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with the negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lectures on non-perturbative Seiberg-Witten geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lectures we detail the interplay between the low-energy dynamics of quantum field theories with four supercharges and the exact WKB analysis. This exposition may be the first comprehensive account of this connection, containing various novel arguments and illustrative examples.
  The lectures start with the introduction of massive two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and their spectra of BPS solitons. We place these theories in a two-dimensional cigar background with supersymmetric boundary conditions labelled by a phase $\zeta = e^{i \vartheta}$, while turning on the two-dimensional $\Omega$-background with parameter~$\epsilon$. We show that the resulting partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ can be characterized as the Borel-summed solution, in the direction $\vartheta$, to an associated Schr\"odinger equation. The partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ is locally constant in the phase $\vartheta$ and jumps across phases $\vartheta_\textrm{BPS}$ associated with the BPS solitons. Since these jumps are non-perturbative in the parameter~$\epsilon$, we refer to $Z^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ as the non-perturbative partition function for the original two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. We completely determine this partition function $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ in two classes of examples, Landau-Ginzburg models and gauged linear sigma models, and show that $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ encodes the well-known vortex partition function at a special phase $\vartheta_\textrm{FN}$ associated with the presence of self-solitons. This analysis generalizes to four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the $\frac{1}{2} \Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>On the open TS/ST correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

      <title>Damped photonic modes in helicoidal graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>What quantum matter tells about quantisation of gravity in a statistical mechanics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a "guide" towards quantisation of gravity based on quantum matter in a statistical mechanics context. On one hand, a statistical mechanics model naturally arises from the thermodynamic interpretation of horizons in Rindler space. On the other hand, the path integral formulation of quantum field theory can be interpreted from the point of view of statistical mechanics. From these perspectives, gravity and matter are related to each other in the same way as a gas and its chemical potential are. This statistical mechanics interpretation of gravity and matter suggests that gravity should be quantised in a precise way which is determined by the quantisation of matter. Although, in a first step, quantisation of gravity applies for small perturbations of the metric with respect to the vacuum, the most central and general features of quantisation (quantisation prescription, quantum space dimensions) are supported from statistical mechanics and remain valid non-perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations with multiple scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise Langlois' Hamiltonian treatment of gauge-invariant linear cosmological perturbations to a cosmological setting with multiple scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity. We review the Hamilton-Jacobi-like technique for a Hamiltonian system with first-class constraints. With this technique, elucidating the gauge-invariant quantities of the system is reduced to solving for the generating function of the appropriate canonical transformation. We then apply it to the case with only two scalar fields, showcasing how the presence of more than one scalar field results in a coupled evolution of the different gauge-invariant scalar degrees of freedom. Their coupled evolution may lead to new phenomenology that cannot be simply inferred by superimposing the results of the single-field case. A simple tracking of the scalar degrees of freedom present in a system with an arbitrary number of scalar fields drives the conclusion that the results for the two-field case can be trivially extended to a multi-field scenario. For completeness, we conclude by recasting explicitly the derivation for the tensor modes, which is nevertheless unaffected by the number of scalar fields in the system. The resulting gauge-invariant Hamiltonian formulation provides a solid foundation for a canonical quantisation of perturbations, necessary to explore the quantum nature of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy within the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the quasinormal modes of Taub-NUT-AdS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for the numerical evaluation of scalar quasinormal modes in Taub-NUT-AdS$_4$ spacetimes. To achieve this we consider angular modes that correspond to non-unitary highest weight $SU(2)$ representations since global regularity is not consistent with the presence of complex quasinormal modes. We show that for any non-zero value of the NUT charge $n$ there exists a region in the complex plane that contains only stable quasinormal modes. The radius of this region increases with the horizon distance and decreases with $n$ towards a constant value for infinite $n$. We also find analytic and numerical evidence for the existence of a critical NUT charge $n_{cr}$ beyond which the lowest lying stable quasinormal modes become overdamped. Our results draw an intricate picture for the holographic fluid of Taub-NUT-AdS$_4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained. We examine the properties of the SDE solutions and discuss the reasons for this situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the orbital period of Kerr black holes, Hod proposed a conjecture that a general lower bound on the orbital period may exist. In this work, we examined this bound by exploring the orbital period of Kerr-Newman black holes using analytical and numerical methods. By choosing different charge and spin of Kerr-Newman black holes, we found a lower bound for the orbital period of Kerr-Newman black holes as $T(r)\geqslant 4\pi M$, where $r$ is the orbital radius, $T(r)$ is the orbital period observed from infinity and $M$ is the black hole mass. This bound is just the same as Hod's conjectured lower bound. So our results further demonstrated that Hod's lower bound may be a general property in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes is unstable against small modifications of the radial potential describing massless perturbations. We study how these small modifications affect the convergence of the quasinormal mode expansion and the mode excitation by computing the mode amplitudes from first principles, without relying on any fitting procedure. We show that the decomposition of the prompt ringdown waveform is not unique: small modifications in the radial potential produce new quasinormal mode ''basis sets'' that can improve the convergence of the quasinormal mode expansion, even capturing the late-time tail. We also study avoided crossings and exceptional points of the Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter spectrum. We show that while the mode amplitude can be resonantly excited, modes that exhibit avoided crossing destructively interfere with each other, so that the prompt ringdown waveform remains stable.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the flavor structure of leptons via diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to explore the flavor structure of leptons using diffusion models, which are known as one of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with the type I seesaw mechanism and train a neural network to generate the neutrino mass matrix. By utilizing transfer learning, the diffusion model generates 104 solutions that are consistent with the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing angles. The distributions of the CP phases and the sums of neutrino masses, which are not included in the conditional labels but are calculated from the solutions, exhibit non-trivial tendencies. In addition, the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is concentrated near the boundaries of the existing confidence intervals, allowing us to verify the obtained solutions through future experiments. An inverse approach using the diffusion model is expected to facilitate the experimental verification of flavor models from a perspective distinct from conventional analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Quantisations of exactly solvable ghostly models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an exactly solvable two-dimensional Lorentzian coupled quantum system that in a certain parameter regime can be transformed to a higher time derivative theory (HTDT) with preserved symplectic structure. By transforming the system's Lagrangian, we explicitly map it onto the standard Pais-Uhlenbeck formulation, revealing a direct correspondence in their dynamical and Poisson bracket structures. We quantise the model in two alternative ways. First we derive the eigensystem of the Hamiltonian by solving the Schr\"odinger equation through an Ansatz that leads to a set of coupled three-term recurrence relations, that we solve exactly, identifying normalisable wavefunctions and their associated energy spectra. We compare our results with a Fock space construction, finding exact agreement. On the basis of the exact solutions we report several specific physical properties of the ghost model investigated with a focus on the localisation properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the mass scales of order $\sim 6 $ TeV, possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>The impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurements with the SMOG2 program at LHCb on the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the potential impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurement within the SMOG2 fixed-target program at the LHCb experiment on nuclear parton distribution functions. Following~\cite{Bursche:2018orf}, we assume that SMOG2 will collect data for five nuclear targets: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and hydrogen which will provide a baseline for constructing nuclear ratios. The analysis is performed by using the PDF reweighting method. We demonstrate that such a measurement will allow to considerably reduce the current uncertainties of the nuclear gluon distribution and, to some extent, even the uncertainties of the light sea-quark distributions. Furthermore, it will provide the first possibility to systematically study the current assumptions on the $A$-dependence of the nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Transitioning to Memory Burden: Detectable Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that black holes are subjected to the memory burden effect, implying that after certain time the information stored in them suppresses the decay rate. This effect opens up a new window for small primordial black holes (PBHs) below $10^{15}\,{\rm g}$ as dark matter. We show that the smooth transition from semi-classical evaporation to the memory-burdened phase strongly impacts observational bounds on the abundance of small PBHs. The most stringent constraints come from present-day fluxes of astrophysical particles. Remarkably, currently-transitioning small PBHs are detectable through high-energetic neutrino events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With non-perturbative de Sitter gravity and holography in mind, we deduce the genus expansion of de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim (dS JT) gravity. We find that this simple model of quantum cosmology has an effective string coupling which is pure imaginary. This imaginary coupling gives rise to alternating signs in the genus expansion of the dS JT S-matrix, which as a result appears to be Borel-Le Roy resummable. Furthermore dS JT gravity is formally an analytic continuation of AdS JT gravity, and behaves like a matrix integral with a negative number of degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls using fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider two different scenarios: first, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic three-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls during head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regard to stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are classically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With regard to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on many different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.</description>

Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines stationary state conditions, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Carrollian field theory on the Rindler horizon which is dual to a bulk massless scalar field theory in the four-dimensional Rindler wedge. The Carrollian field theory could be mapped to a two-dimensional Euclidean field theory in the transverse plane by a Fourier transform. After defining the incoming and outgoing states at the future and past Rindler horizon, respectively, we construct the boundary-to-boundary and bulk-to-boundary propagators that are consistent with the bulk Green's function in the literature. We investigate the tree-level Carrollian amplitudes up to four points. The tree-level four-point Carrollian amplitude in $\Phi^4$ theory has the same structure as the one-loop triangle Feynman integral in the Lee-Pomeransky representation with complex powers in the propagators and spacetime dimension. Moreover, the four-point Carrollian amplitude with a zero energy state inserted at infinity in $\Phi^4$ theory is proportional to the three-point Carrollian amplitude in $\Phi^3$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some aspects of quantum field theory in a general (i.e. non inertial) frame of Minkowski spacetime are studied. Conditions for the presence of horizons as well as for the modification of the definition of positive energy solutions are examined. The standard wisdom is confirmed that none of these phenomena is generic. This corroborates that in the general case there is no natural way to define positive frequencies, which is the standard road to define particles. In that sense, (as well as in others) non inertial frames are similar to curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Geometry and symmetries of Hermitian-Einstein and instanton connection moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ of Hermitian-Einstein irreducible connections on a vector bundle $E$ over a K\"ahler with torsion (KT) manifold $M^{2n}$ that admits holomorphic and $\h\nabla$-covariantly constant vector fields, where $\h\nabla$ is the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. We demonstrate that such vector fields induce an action on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ that leaves both the metric and complex structure invariant. Moreover, if an additional condition is satisfied, the induced vector fields are covariantly constant with respect to the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $\h{\mathcal{ D}}$ on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$. We demonstrate that in the presence of such vector fields, the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ can be modelled on that of holomorphic toric principal bundles with base space KT manifolds and give some examples.
  We also extend our analysis to the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(M^{4})$ of instanton connections on vector bundles over KT, bi-KT (generalised K\"ahler) and hyper-K\"ahler with torsion (HKT) manifolds $M^4$. We find that the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(S^3\times S^1)$ can be modelled on that of principal bundles with fibre $S^3\times S^1$ over Quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds with torsion (QKT). In addition motivated by applications to AdS/CFT, we explore the (superconformal) symmetry algebras of two-dimensional sigma models with target spaces such moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider half BPS operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) in $p+1$ dimensions. These operators satisfy trace relations that are identical to those discussed in the $p=3$ case ($\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM). Nevertheless, the bulk explanation of these trace relations must differ from the $p = 3$ case as their holographic duals are not AdS spacetimes. We identify giant graviton solutions in the dual holographic backgrounds for $-1 \le p \le 4$. In the 't Hooft limit, these giants are D$(6-p)$-branes that wrap a $S_{6-p} \subset S_{8-p}$. We also follow the giants into the strong coupling region where they become other branes. Despite propagating in a non-AdS geometry, we find that the branes "feel" like they are in AdS. This is closely related to the emergent scaling symmetry present in these boundary theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new bootstrap equation in 2-dimensional conformal field theory is derived starting from the momentum-space representation of the correlation functions. Since Wightman functions are not crossing-symmetric, the analyticity properties of the commutator are leveraged instead to obtain a relation between two distinct operator product expansions. The procedure requires evaluating a 4-point function with two light-like momenta. The result is an asymmetric equation valid for arbitrary theories in 1d and 2d. The new crossing equation admits two simple projections onto orthogonal bases of Jacobi polynomials, reproducing known sets of analytic functionals. One of these, with zeros at double-twist dimensions, was known only as a contour integral. The closed-form expression found in this work is new. We provide a few examples of applications of the new crossing equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we uncover a connection that relates the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of 5D SCFTs derived from geometric engineering methods to monodromies of the corresponding B-models via mirror symmetry. Viewing defects as branes wrapping relative cycles in a non-compact CY3, we find that the defect groups can be read off from the VEVs of the corresponding line operators at the leading order. Via mirror map, we find that both the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of the SCFT are related to the monodromy at the large radius point in the B-model. Additionally, we recursively obtain closed-form expressions of instanton expansions of the VEV of Wilson lines of certain 5D theories among which some have not been obtained so far using localization methods. We further conjecture that the 2-group symmetry is given by the Mordell-Weil torsion of the universal special geometry associated to the theory, generalizing the conjecture for rank-1 theories.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the finite basis topologies of two-loop dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme in the Standard Model. We present a functionally distinct finite basis of Master Integrals which spans the whole transcendental space of all two-loop Feynman integrals with external momenta in four dimensions. We also indicate that all the two-loop Master Integrals, in an appropriate basis, with more than 8 denominators do not contribute to the finite part of any two-loop scattering amplitude. In addition, we elaborate on the application of the `t Hooft-Veltman decomposition to improve the performance of numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals using AMFlow and DCT packages. Moreover, we analyze the spectrum of special functions and the corresponding geometries appearing in any two-loop scattering amplitude. Our work will allow for a reduction in the computational complexity required for providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables, both analytically and numerically.</description>

Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting of circularly accelerated detectors with a reflecting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the transition probability for a circularly accelerated detector that interacts with the massless scalar fields in the presence of a reflecting boundary. As the trajectory radius increases, the transition probability may exhibit some peaks under specific conditions, which can lead to the possibility of the identical result for different trajectory radius with the same acceleration and energy gap. These behaviors can be characterized by certain critical values. Furthermore, we analyze the entanglement harvesting phenomenon for two circularly accelerated detectors with a boundary. We consider that the two detectors are rotating around a common axis with the same acceleration, trajectory radius and angular velocity. When the detectors are close to the boundary, there may exist two peaks in entanglement harvesting. Interestingly, as trajectory radius increases, entanglement harvesting in some situations first decreases to zero, then remains zero, and finally increases to a stable value. Our results show that the features observed properties of the detectors are closely related to the vacuum fluctuations of the field and states of the detectors. Under appropriate conditions, circular motion can be used to simulate the results of uniform acceleration.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Critical Systems: Revisiting Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter embedded in a cloud of strings. The effects of its surroundings on thermodynamics, timelike and null geodesics, shadows, and quasinormal modes are analyzed. It is demonstrated that changes in spacetime, induced by the surrounding environment, significantly influence the stability, thermal phases, energy dynamics, particle trajectories, and observable features of the black hole's shadow, as well as the oscillation frequency and decay rate.</description>

      <title>Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole's shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to $0 \leq \gamma \lesssim 0.036$ and $-0.2 \lesssim \alpha \leq 0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Proca stars: Spherical stationary and multi-frequency states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we follow an effective theory approach to study the nonrelativistic limit of a selfgravitating and selfinteracting massive vector field. Our effective theory is characterized by three parameters: the field's mass $m_0$ and the selfinteraction constants $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda_s$. For definiteness, we focus on a systematic study of the equilibrium configurations, commonly referred to as Proca stars when they have finite energy. We identify two different types of Proca stars, depending on the specific sector of the effective theory that we are exploring. In the generic sector, defined by $\lambda_s\neq 0$, all equilibrium configurations are stationary states described by wave functions that evolve harmonically in time. However, in the symmetry-enhanced sector, for which $\lambda_s=0$, there exist multi-frequency states whose wave functions oscillate with two or three distinct frequencies in addition to the stationary states. We determine the conditions under which a ground state configuration with fixed particle number exists. When these conditions are met, we prove that the lowest energy is reached by a stationary spherically symmetric configuration of constant polarization that is linear or circular depending on the sign of $\lambda_s$. We numerically construct some illustrative examples of spherical stationary and multi-frequency solutions, analyze their properties, and compare them with our analytical predictions. Unlike stationary states and other soliton configurations, which form a discrete set in the solution space associated with fixed particle number, the symmetry-enhanced sector exhibits a continuum of solutions with multi-frequency states connecting stationary states of constant polarization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as the temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for scattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange metal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>All axion dark matter from supersymmetric models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models accompanied by certain anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries Z_n^R are attractive in that 1. the R-symmetry (which can arise from compactified string theory as a remnant of the broken 10-d Lorentz symmetry) forbids unwanted superpotential terms while allowing for the generation of an accidental, approximate global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry needed to solve the strong CP problem and 2. they provide a raison d'etre for an otherwise ad-hoc R-parity conservation. We augment the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by two additional Z_n^R- and PQ-charged fields X and Y wherein SUSY breaking at an intermediate scale m_{hidden} leads to PQ breaking at a scale f_a\sim 10^{11} GeV leading to a SUSY DFSZ axion. The same SUSY breaking can trigger R-parity breaking via higher-dimensional operators leading to tiny R-violating couplings of order (f_a/m_P)^N and a WIMP quality problem. For Z_4^R and Z_8^R, we find only an N=1 suppression. Then the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) of the MSSM becomes unstable with a lifetime of order ~ 10^{-3}-10 seconds so the LSPs all decay away before the present epoch. That leaves a universe with all axion cold dark matter and no WIMPs in accord with recent LZ-2024 WIMP search results.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Early Career Researcher Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update: White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>
