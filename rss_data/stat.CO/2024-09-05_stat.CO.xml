      <title>Conditional logistic individual-level models of spatial infectious disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we introduce a novel framework for modelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease spread known as conditional logistic individual-level models (CL-ILM's). This framework alleviates much of the computational burden associated with traditional spatiotemporal individual-level models for epidemics, and facilitates the use of standard software for fitting logistic models when analysing spatiotemporal disease patterns. The models can be fitted in either a frequentist or Bayesian framework. Here, we apply the new spatial CL-ILM to both simulated and semi-real data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.</description>

      <title>Guidance for twisted particle filter: a continuous-time perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle filter (PF), also known as the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), is designed to approximate high-dimensional probability distributions and their normalizing constants in the discrete-time setting. To reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation, several twisted particle filters (TPF) have been proposed by researchers, where one chooses or learns a twisting function that modifies the Markov transition kernel. In this paper, we study the TPF from a continuous-time perspective. Under suitable settings, we show that the discrete-time model converges to a continuous-time limit, which can be solved through a series of well-studied control-based importance sampling algorithms. This discrete-continuous connection allows the design of new TPF algorithms inspired by established continuous-time algorithms. As a concrete example, guided by existing importance sampling algorithms in the continuous-time setting, we propose a novel algorithm called ``Twisted-Path Particle Filter" (TPPF), where the twist function, parameterized by neural networks, minimizes specific KL-divergence between path measures. Some numerical experiments are given to illustrate the capability of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Parallel Quasi-Quantum Annealing with Gradient-Based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained attention as general-purpose solvers because they can automatically learn problem-specific heuristics, reducing the need for manually crafted heuristics. However, these methods often face challenges with scalability. To address these issues, the improved Sampling algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization (iSCO) using discrete Langevin dynamics has been proposed, demonstrating better performance than several learning-based solvers. This study proposes a different approach that integrates gradient-based update through continuous relaxation, combined with Quasi-Quantum Annealing (QQA). QQA smoothly transitions the objective function from a simple convex form, where half-integral solutions dominate, to the original objective function, where the variables are restricted to 0 or 1. Furthermore, we incorporate parallel run communication leveraging GPUs, enhancing exploration capabilities and accelerating convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is a competitive general-purpose solver, achieving comparable performance to iSCO across various benchmark problems. Notably, our method exhibits superior trade-offs between speed and solution quality for large-scale instances compared to iSCO, commercial solvers, and specialized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Simulation-calibration testing for inference in Lasso regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a test of the significance of a variable appearing on the Lasso path and use it in a procedure for selecting one of the models of the Lasso path, controlling the Family-Wise Error Rate. Our null hypothesis depends on a set A of already selected variables and states that it contains all the active variables. We focus on the regularization parameter value from which a first variable outside A is selected. As the test statistic, we use this quantity's conditional p-value, which we define conditional on the non-penalized estimated coefficients of the model restricted to A. We estimate this by simulating outcome vectors and then calibrating them on the observed outcome's estimated coefficients. We adapt the calibration heuristically to the case of generalized linear models in which it turns into an iterative stochastic procedure. We prove that the test controls the risk of selecting a false positive in linear models, both under the null hypothesis and, under a correlation condition, when A does not contain all active variables. We assess the performance of our procedure through extensive simulation studies. We also illustrate it in the detection of exposures associated with drug-induced liver injuries in the French pharmacovigilance database.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of hidden Markov models: comparison of EM and quasi-Newton methods with a new hybrid algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMM) model a sequence of observations that are dependent on a hidden (or latent) state that follow a Markov chain. These models are widely used in diverse fields including ecology, speech recognition, and genetics.Parameter estimation in HMM is typically performed using the Baum-Welch algorithm, a special case of the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. While this method guarantee the convergence to a local maximum, its convergence rates is usually slow.Alternative methods, such as the direct maximisation of the likelihood using quasi-Newton methods (such as L-BFGS-B) can offer faster convergence but can be more complicated to implement due to challenges to deal with the presence of bounds on the space of parameters.We propose a novel hybrid algorithm, QNEM, that combines the Baum-Welch and the quasi-Newton algorithms. QNEM aims to leverage the strength of both algorithms by switching from one method to the other based on the convexity of the likelihood function.We conducted a comparative analysis between QNEM, the Baum-Welch algorithm, an EM acceleration algorithm called SQUAREM (Varadhan, 2008, Scand J Statist), and the L-BFGS-B quasi-Newton method by applying these algorithms to four examples built on different models. We estimated the parameters of each model using the different algorithms and evaluated their performances.Our results show that the best-performing algorithm depends on the model considered. QNEM performs well overall, always being faster or equivalent to L-BFGS-B. The Baum-Welch and SQUAREM algorithms are faster than the quasi-Newton and QNEM algorithms in certain scenarios with multiple optimum. In conclusion, QNEM offers a promising alternative to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Randomized Maximum Likelihood via High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posterior sampling for high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems is a common challenge in real-world applications. Randomized Maximum Likelihood (RML) is an optimization based methodology that gives samples from an approximation to the posterior distribution. We develop a high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate models to solve the RML problem. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in comparison to alternative optimization methods on a variety of synthetic and real-world Bayesian inverse problems, including medical and magnetohydrodynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor product algorithms for inference of contact network from epidemiological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a problem of inferring contact network from nodal states observed during an epidemiological process. In a black--box Bayesian optimisation framework this problem reduces to a discrete likelihood optimisation over the set of possible networks. The cardinality of this set grows combinatorially with the number of network nodes, which makes this optimisation computationally challenging. For each network, its likelihood is the probability for the observed data to appear during the evolution of the epidemiological process on this network. This probability can be very small, particularly if the network is significantly different from the ground truth network, from which the observed data actually appear. A commonly used stochastic simulation algorithm struggles to recover rare events and hence to estimate small probabilities and likelihoods. In this paper we replace the stochastic simulation with solving the chemical master equation for the probabilities of all network states. Since this equation also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we apply tensor train approximations to overcome it and enable fast and accurate computations. Numerical simulations demonstrate efficient black--box Bayesian inference of the network.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces and analyses interacting underdamped Langevin algorithms, termed Kinetic Interacting Particle Langevin Monte Carlo (KIPLMC) methods, for statistical inference in latent variable models. We propose a diffusion process that evolves jointly in the space of parameters and latent variables and exploit the fact that the stationary distribution of this diffusion concentrates around the maximum marginal likelihood estimate of the parameters. We then provide two explicit discretisations of this diffusion as practical algorithms to estimate parameters of statistical models. For each algorithm, we obtain nonasymptotic rates of convergence for the case where the joint log-likelihood is strongly concave with respect to latent variables and parameters. In particular, we provide convergence analysis for the diffusion together with the discretisation error, providing convergence rate estimates for the algorithms in Wasserstein-2 distance. We achieve accelerated convergence rates clearly demonstrating improvement in dimension dependence, similar to the underdamped samplers. To demonstrate the utility of the introduced methodology, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion for statistical inference and the stability of the numerical integrators utilised for discretisation. Our setting covers a broad number of applications, including unsupervised learning, statistical inference, and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive operator learning for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental computational issues in Bayesian inverse problems (BIP) governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) stem from the requirement of repeated forward model evaluations. A popular strategy to reduce such costs is to replace expensive model simulations with computationally efficient approximations using operator learning, motivated by recent progress in deep learning. However, using the approximated model directly may introduce a modeling error, exacerbating the already ill-posedness of inverse problems. Thus, balancing between accuracy and efficiency is essential for the effective implementation of such approaches. To this end, we develop an adaptive operator learning framework that can reduce modeling error gradually by forcing the surrogate to be accurate in local areas. This is accomplished by adaptively fine-tuning the pre-trained approximate model with training points chosen by a greedy algorithm during the posterior evaluation process. To validate our approach, we use DeepOnet to construct the surrogate and unscented Kalman inversion (UKI) to approximate the BIP solution, respectively. Furthermore, we present a rigorous convergence guarantee in the linear case using the UKI framework. The approach is tested on a number of benchmarks, including the Darcy flow, the heat source inversion problem, and the reaction-diffusion problem. The numerical results show that our method can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining inversion accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal combination of composite likelihoods using approximate Bayesian computation with application to state-space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite likelihood provides approximate inference when the full likelihood is intractable and sub-likelihood functions of marginal events can be evaluated relatively easily. It has been successfully applied for many complex models. However, its wider application is limited by two issues. First, weight selection of marginal likelihood can have a significant impact on the information efficiency and is currently an open question. Second, calibrated Bayesian inference with composite likelihood requires curvature adjustment which is difficult for dependent data. This work shows that approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can properly address these two issues by using multiple composite score functions as summary statistics. First, the summary-based posterior distribution gives the optimal Godambe information among a wide class of estimators defined by linear combinations of estimating functions. Second, to make ABC computationally feasible for models where marginal likelihoods have no closed form, a novel approach is proposed to estimate all simulated marginal scores using a Monte Carlo sample with size N. Sufficient conditions are given for the additional noise to be negligible with N fixed as the data size n goes to infinity, and the computational cost is O(n). Third, asymptotic properties of ABC with summary statistics having heterogeneous convergence rates is derived, and an adaptive scheme to choose the component composite scores is proposed. Numerical studies show that the new method significantly outperforms the existing Bayesian composite likelihood methods, and the efficiency of adaptively combined composite scores well approximates the efficiency of particle MCMC using the full likelihood.</description>
