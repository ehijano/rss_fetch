      <title>Dirac structures in nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a Dirac algebroid, which is a linear almost Dirac structure on a vector bundle, was designed to generate phase equations for mechanical systems with linear nonholonomic constraints. We apply it to systems with magnetic-like or gyroscopic potentials, that were previously described by means of almost Poisson structures. The almost Poisson structures present in the literature in this context were constructed using constraints, metrics and information about magnetic or gyroscopic potential present in the Hamiltonian function of the system. The Dirac algebroid we use is constructed out of constraints and canonical geometric structures of the underlying bundles and is universal in the sense that it is independent on the particular Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. We provide examples showing that using the same Dirac structure we can describe systems with different potentials, magnetic or mechanical, added freely to a function generating the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials and the discrete CKP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper intends to construct discrete spectral transformations for Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials, and find its corresponding discrete integrable systems. It turns out that the normalization factor of Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials acts as the $\tau$-function of the discrete CKP equation, which has applications in Yang-Baxter equation, integrable geometry, cluster algebra, and so on.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems: Spacetime as the web of correlations of a many-body quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that spacetime in causal fermion systems can be understood as the web of correlations of a many-body quantum system.This argument highlights the fact that causal fermion systems is a completely relational theory. We also explain how our perception of a background (spacetime) emerges in the limit where the number of states taken in consideration goes to infinity. This thereby constitutes a complete viable ontology for causal fermion systems which are not reliant on the continuum limit. A key insight is the fact that in a relevant subset of causal fermion systems, which includes the continuum limit of the Minkowski vacuum spacetime, minimization of the causal action can be understood as a minimization of fluctuations in the causal structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>On Unitary Groups in Ternary and Generalized Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a generalization of Clifford algebras known as generalized Clifford algebras (in particular, ternary Clifford algebras). In these objects, we have a fixed higher-degree form (in particular, a ternary form) instead of a quadratic form in ordinary Clifford algebras. We present a natural realization of unitary Lie groups, which are important in physics and other applications, using only operations in generalized Clifford algebras and without using the corresponding matrix representations. Basis-free definitions of the determinant, trace, and characteristic polynomial in generalized Clifford algebras are introduced. Explicit formulas for all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and inverse in generalized Clifford algebras are presented. The operation of Hermitian conjugation (or Hermitian transpose) in generalized Clifford algebras is introduced without using the corresponding matrix representations.</description>

      <title>Bethe roots for periodic TASEP and algebraic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algebraic method to study solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations for the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP). We give an algebro-geometric formulation of the spectral problem for the periodic TASEP with arbitrary numbers of sites and particles, in which the Bethe ansatz equations are realized as an algebraic equation on a certain Riemann surface. While our Riemann surface is essentially the same as the one introduced by Prolhac, we focus on its algebraic realization as a (singular) plane curve. By a counting argument on the Riemann surface, we give a rigorous proof of the completeness of the Bethe ansatz. The decomposition of the Riemann surface into connected components determines how often each value of the product of Bethe roots appears. We classify the connected components and their multiplicities using a similar argument to the spectral degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the Markov matrix discussed by Golinelli-Mallick. We also give explicit formulas for the number of connected components, the number of ramification points, and the total genus of the Riemann surface. The formulas recover the table of examples presented by Prolhac. Moreover, we explore applications of the special type of Bethe roots that appear in this case to partition functions of the five-vertex model. We introduce a version of the free energy and evaluate the thermodynamic limit to find the explicit form in terms of the Riemann zeta functions.</description>

      <title>SUSY hierarchies of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with different detuning parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to show how supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics can be applied to the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian of quantum optics. These SUSY transformations connect pairs of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians characterized by different detuning parameters as well as Jaynes-Cummings to anti-Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians. Therefore, JC Hamiltonians can be classified in hierarchies or sequences which are connected through SUSY transformations. As a byproduct, the symmetries of JC Hamiltonians are found as well as the special case of a sequence of resonant-like interacting systems having the form of a simple shape invariant JC Hamiltonian hierarchy.</description>

      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of pro-p groups and relative Poincar\'{e} duality, we define a type of cobordism category well suited to arithmetic topology. We completely classify topological quantum field theories on these two-dimensional versions of our cobordism categories. This classification uses Frobenius algebras with extra operations corresponding to automorphisms of the p-adic integers. We look in more detail at the example of arithmetic Dijkgraff--Witten theory for a finite gauge p-group in this setting. This allows us to deduce formulae counting Galois extensions of local p-adic fields whose Galois groups are the given gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies Frobenius manifolds arising from extended deformations of complex structures on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, following the construction by Sergey Barannikov and Maxim Kontsevich. The work is based on the investigation of formal moduli spaces of solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equations modulo gauge equivalence. We provide a foundational overview of deformation theory from the perspective of differential geometry and prove the equivalence between gauge-equivalent deformations and isomorphic deformations. Based on this framework, we construct a differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkovisky (dGBV) algebra associated to the deformation of Calabi-Yau manifolds and then construct the corresponding Frobenius manifold.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Renormalization as Riemann-Hilbert Decomposition of Schwinger-Dyson D-Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative formulation of renormalization by viewing the regularized Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy as a meromorphic connection, that is, as a D-module on the product of spacetime with the regulator disc. The irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence splits this connection into a purely formal submodule that contains every ultraviolet pole and a holomorphic submodule that is finite at the regulator origin. In this setting, counterterms coincide with the formal Stokes data, the renormalized theory is identified with the analytic submodule, and the Callan-Symanzik flow appears as an isomonodromic deformation in the physical scale. Viewed through this lens, the Connes-Kreimer construction with its graph Hopf algebra, Bogoliubov recursion, and Birkhoff factorisation is simply the perturbative shadow cast by the global geometric decomposition of the full Schwinger-Dyson system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. Using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, we derive the action of the theory in purely geometric terms, which coincides with prior results in the literature. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction while making the BRST symmetry explicit and providing a natural framework for classical observables. We also show that the Batalin-Vilkovisky action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability for large times of homogeneous stationary states for the nonlinear Hartree equation for density matrices in Rd for d\geq3. We can reach both the optimal Sobolev and Schatten exponents for the initial data, with a wide class of interaction potentials w (under the sole assumption that w is bounded, including in particular delta potentials). Our method relies on fractional Leibniz rules for density matrices to deal with the fractional critical Sobolev regularity s = d/2 -1 for odd d, as well as Christ-Kiselev lemmas in Schatten spaces.</description>

      <title>Extremal Ising Gibbs States on Lobachevsky planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.</description>

      <title>On post-Lie structures for free Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study post-Lie structures on free Lie algebras, the Grossman-Larson product on their enveloping algebras, and provide an abstract formula for its dual coproduct. This might be of interest for the general theory of post-Hopf algebras. Using a magmatic approach, we explore post-Lie algebras connected to multiple zeta values and their $q$-analogues. For multiple zeta values, this framework yields an algebraic interpretation of the Goncharov coproduct. Assuming that the Bernoulli numbers satisfy the so called threshold shuffle identities, we present a post-Lie structure, whose induced Lie bracket we expect to restrict to the dual of indecomposables of multiple $q$-zeta values. Our post-Lie algebras align with Ecalle's theory of bimoulds: we explicitly identify the ari bracket with a post-Lie structure on a free Lie algebra, and conjecture a correspondence for the uri bracket.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction in Quaternionic Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quaternion-based strategies for quantum error correction by extending quantum mechanics into quaternionic Hilbert spaces. Building on the properties of quaternionic quantum states, we define quaternionic analogues of Pauli operators and quantum gates, ensuring inner product preservation and Hilbert space conditions. A simple encoding scheme maps logical qubits into quaternionic systems, introducing natural redundancy and enhanced resilience against noise. We construct a quaternionic extension of the five-qubit code, introducing a framework of 15 syndrome measurements to detect quaternionic errors, including quaternionically rotated error components. Numerical estimates show that the quaternionic five-qubit code achieves a logical error threshold of approximately $p_{th} \approx 0.015$, demonstrating improved performance compared to the standard complex-valued code. These results suggest a new pathway for quantum error correction in high-noise environments, leveraging the richer structure of quaternionic quantum mechanics to improve fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement incompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality, which distinguish it from classical physics. These phenomena are often studied separately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a unified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them. By representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of column-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections between different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by examining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces, providing geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by simpler measurement settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal law of the KPZ fixed point. For the droplet geometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared to a previous formula of Johansson and the author. For the stationary geometry, we find the two-time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains and Ferrari-Spohn. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of corresponding multi-time formulas for geometric last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of interpolating random circulant matrix and its applications to random circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a versatile matrix model of the form ${\bf A}+i {\bf B}$, where ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ are real random circulant matrices with independent but, in general, nonidentically distributed Gaussian entries. For this model, we derive exact results for the joint probability density function and find that it is a multivariate Gaussian. Arbitrary order marginal density therefore also readily follows. It is demonstrated that by adjusting the averages and variances of the Gaussian elements of ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$, we can interpolate between a remarkably wide range of eigenvalue distributions in the complex plane. In particular, we can examine the crossover between a random real circulant matrix and a random complex circulant matrix. We also extend our study to include Wigner-like and Wishart-like matrices constructed from our general random circulant matrix. To validate our analytical findings, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted, which confirm the accuracy of our results. Additionally, we compare our analytical results with the spectra of adjacency matrices from various random circulant graphs. Despite the difference in entry distributions-Gaussian in our model and non-Gaussian in the adjacency matrices-the densities show excellent agreement in the large-dimension limit.</description>

      <title>Introducing Multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is easier to investigate phenomena in particle physics geometrically by exploring a real solution to the Dirac-Hestenes equation instead of a complex solution to the Dirac equation. The current research presents a formulation of the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation. Since the matrix representation of the complexified (Clifford) geometric algebra $\mathbb{C}\otimes{C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ depends on the parity of $n$, we examine even and odd cases separately. In the geometric algebra ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,3}$, there is a lemma on a unique decomposition of an element of the minimal left ideal into the product of the idempotent and an element of the real even subalgebra. The lemma is used to construct the four-dimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation. The analogous lemma is not valid in the multidimensional case, since the dimension of the real even subalgebra of ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ is bigger than the dimension of the minimal left ideal for $n&gt;4$. Hence, we consider the auxiliary real subalgebra of ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$ to prove a similar statement. We present the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation in ${C \kern -0.1em \ell}_{1,n}$. We prove that one might obtain a solution to the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation using a solution to the multidimensional Dirac equation and vice versa. We also show that the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation has gauge invariance.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of rank of multivector in Clifford geometric algebras of arbitrary dimension without using the corresponding matrix representations and using only geometric algebra operations. We use the concepts of characteristic polynomial in geometric algebras and the method of SVD. The results can be used in various applications of geometric algebras in computer science, engineering, and physics.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <title>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euclidean conformal integrals for an arbitrary number of points in any dimension are evaluated. Conformal transformations in the Euclidean space can be formulated as the Moebius group in terms of Clifford algebras. This is used to interpret conformal integrals as functions on the configuration space of points on the Euclidean space, solving linear differential equations, which, in turn, is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for the conformal integrals are obtained using toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. The solutions are made symmetric under the action of permutation of the points, as expected of quantities on the configuration space of unordered points, using the monodromy-invariant unique Hermitian form. Consistency of the solutions among different number of points is shown.</description>

  operator corresponding to pair potentials that satisfy a square summability
  condition on the variations, when the inverse temperature is subcritical. As a corollary we
  obtain a continuous eigenfunction for the classical Dyson model, with
  interactions $\J(k)=\beta \, k^{-\alpha}$, $k\ge1$, in the whole subcritical

We establish the Schur-Weyl type duality between degenerate affine Hecke algebras of type BC and twisted super Yangians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of superstatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics which admits temperature fluctuations, and generates non-canonical ensembles from the distribution function of these fluctuations. Recently, some results have been presented showing that superstatistics is not universally applicable, but several conditions on the so-called fundamental inverse temperature function $\beta_F$ must be met by any superstatistical model. In this work we provide a set of neccessary and sufficient conditions for a non-equilibrium steady state model to be expressible by superstatistics, showing that $\beta_F$ by itself determines the existence of a superstatistical distribution of temperature.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Identification of Lattice Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics of lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Langevin dynamics of various lattice formulations of the Yang--Mills--Higgs model, with an inverse Yang--Mills coupling $\beta$ and a Higgs parameter $\kappa$. The Higgs component is either a bounded field taking values in a compact target space, or an unbounded field taking values in a vector space in which case the model also has a Higgs mass parameter $m$. We study the regime where $(\beta,\kappa)$ are small in the first case or $(\beta,\kappa/m)$ are small in the second case. We prove the exponential ergodicity of the dynamics on the whole lattice via functional inequalities. We establish exponential decay of correlations for a broad class of observables, namely, the infinite volume measure exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Moreover, when the target space of the Higgs field is compact, appropriately rescaled observables exhibit factorized correlations in the large $N$ limit. These extend the earlier results \cite{SZZ22} on pure lattice Yang--Mills to the case with a coupled Higgs field.
  Unlike pure lattice Yang--Mills where the field is always bounded, in the case where the coupled Higgs component is unbounded, the control of its behavior is much harder and requires new techniques. Our approach involves a disintegration argument and a delicate analysis of correlations to effectively control the unbounded Higgs component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize double bracket vector fields, originally defined on semisimple Lie algebras, to Poisson manifolds equipped with a pseudo-Riemannian metric by utilizing a symmetric contravariant 2-tensor field. We extend the normal metric on an adjoint orbit of a compact semisimple Lie algebra to ensure that these vector fields become gradient vector fields on each symplectic leaf. Furthermore, we apply this construction to enhance the equilibria of Hamiltonian systems, specifically addressing the challenge of asymptotically stabilizing points that are already stable, through dissipation terms derived from generalized double bracket vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we propose a new gauge-invariant symmetry-reduction approach. Using this method, we successfully identify a cosmological sector of General Relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables that preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory as well as part of the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we analyse the properties of cylindrical functions and the classical constraint algebra, revealing that certain cylindrical functions exhibit distinctive symmetry features.</description>

      <title>Mixing of metastable diffusion processes with Gibbs invariant distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the mixing properties of metastable diffusion processes which possess a Gibbs invariant distribution. For systems with multiple stable equilibria, so-called metastable transitions between these equilibria are required for mixing since the unique invariant distribution is concentrated on these equilibria. Consequently, these systems exhibit slower mixing compared to those with a unique stable equilibrium, as analyzed in Barrera and Jara (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30:1164--1208, 2020). Our proof is based on the theory of metastability, which is a primary tool for studying systems with multiple stable equilibria. Within this framework, we compute the total variation distance between the distribution of the diffusion process and its invariant distribution for any time scale larger than $\epsilon^{-1}$. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for the mixing time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Movshev-Mason-Skinner Cauchy-Riemann (CR) ambitwistor approach, we provide a rigorous yet elementary construction of a twisted CR holomorphic Chern-Simons action on CR ambitwistor space for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional Euclidean space. The key ingredient in our discussion is the homotopy algebraic perspective on perturbative quantum field theory. Using this technology, we show that both theories are semi-classically equivalent, that is, we construct a quasi-isomorphism between the cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras governing both field theories. This confirms a conjecture from the literature. Furthermore, we also show that the Yang-Mills action is obtained by integrating out an infinite tower of auxiliary fields in the Chern-Simons action, that is, the two theories are related by homotopy transfer. Given its simplicity, this Chern-Simons action should form a fruitful starting point for analysing perturbative properties of Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>On sampling two spin models using the local connective constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes novel optimum mixing bounds for the Glauber dynamics on the Hard-core and Ising models. These bounds are expressed in terms of the local connective constant of the underlying graph $G$. This is a notion of effective degree for $G$.
  Our results have some interesting consequences for bounded degree graphs:
  (a) They include the max-degree bounds as a special case
  (b) They improve on the running time of the FPTAS considered in [Sinclair, Srivastava, \v Stefankoni\v c and Yin: PTRF 2017] for general graphs
  (c) They allow us to obtain mixing bounds in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix and improve on [Hayes: FOCS 2006].
  We obtain our results using tools from the theory of high-dimensional expanders and, in particular, the Spectral Independence method [Anari, Liu, Oveis-Gharan: FOCS 2020]. We explore a new direction by utilising the notion of the $k$-non-backtracking matrix $H_{G,k}$ in our analysis with the Spectral Independence. The results with $H_{G,k}$ are interesting in their own right.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules is reconsidered to obtain more properties of these special Hilbert C*-modules. The property of a Hilbert C*-module to be a multiplier C*-module is shown to be an invariant with respect to the consideration as a left or right Hilbert C*-module in the sense of a C*-correspondence in strong Morita equivalence theory. The interrelation of the C*-algebras of ''compact'' operators, the Banach algebras of bounded module operators and the Banach spaces of bounded module operators of a Hilbert C*-module to its C*-dual Banach C*-module are characterized for pairs of Hilbert C*-modules and their respective multiplier modules. The structures on the latter are always isometrically embedded into the respective structures on the former. Examples for which continuation of these kinds of bounded module operators from the initial Hilbert C*-module to its multiplier module fails are given, however existing continuations turn out to be always unique. Similarly, bounded modular functionals from both kinds of Hilbert C*-modules to their respective C*-algebras of coefficients are compared, and eventually existing continuations are shown to be unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze asymptotic height function fluctuations in uniformly random domino tiling models on multiply connected Temperleyan domains. Starting from asymptotic formulas derived by Kenyon [arXiv:math-ph/9910002v1], we show that (1) the difference of the centered height function and a harmonic function with boundary values given by the (random) centered hole heights converges in the sense of moments to a Gaussian free field, which is independent of the hole heights, and (2) the hole heights themselves converge in distribution to a discrete Gaussian random vector. These results confirm general predictions about height fluctuations for tilings on multiply connected domains.</description>

Abstract: We give conserved quantities of two generalizations of conformal circles on the conformal sphere. One generalization concerns curves carrying a distinguished parallel tractor along them, which can be used to construct the conserved quantities. The other is the class of curves satisfying the conformal Mercator equation, the conserved quantities of which are computed using Lagrangian formalism. The two generalizations are not disjoint, and our main result is the relation between their conserved quantities. Explicit examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. Classical solutions of the mass-deformed IKKT matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>
