      <title>Some relationships with subnormal operators and existence of hyperinvariant subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $T$ is a polynomially bounded operator, $\mathcal M$ is an invariant subspace of $T$, $T|_{\mathcal M}$ is a unilateral shift and $T^*|_{\mathcal M^\perp}$ is subnormal, then $T$ has a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace. If an operator $T$ is intertwined from both sides with two operators, one of which is hyponormal and other is the adjoint to hyponormal, then $T$ has a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace. The existence of nontrivial hyperinvariant subspaces for subnormal operators themselves is not studied here.</description>

      <title>Spectral test of reducibility for Matrix tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a tuple of matrices has a common invariant subspace, its projective joint spectrum has an algebraic component. In general, the converse is not true, and there might be algebraic components in the projective joint spectrum without corresponding common invariant subspaces. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of such correspondence.</description>

      <title>On Spaceability within Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spaceability phenomena in linear dynamics from a structural perspective. Given a continuous linear operator \(T:X \to X\), we introduce the set \(\Omega(T)\), consisting of all continuous linear operators \(h:X \to X\) for which there exists a strictly increasing sequence \((\theta_n)_n\) of positive integers such that the set \(\{x \in X : \displaystyle{\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} T^{\theta_n}x = h(x)}\}\) is dense in \(X\). Within this framework, two classical phenomena--the existence of hypercyclic and recurrent subspaces in separable infinite-dimensional complex Banach spaces--emerge as instances of a common underlying structure described by \(\Omega(T)\). To analyze \(\Omega(T)\), we introduce the notion of collections simultaneously approximated (c.s.a.) by \(T\), and show that every maximal c.s.a. is an SOT-closed affine manifold. For quasi-rigid operators on separable Banach spaces, we establish the existence of a unique maximal c.s.a. containing the identity operator. Furthermore, we examine \(\Omega(T)\) through the left-multiplication operator \(L_T\) acting on the algebra of bounded operators. Our approach combines two key ingredients: a refinement of A. L\'opez's technique on recurrent subspaces for quasi-rigid operators, and a common dense-lineability result obtained by the first author and A. Arbieto. These tools yield new spaceability results for the sets \(\Omega(T)\), \(\mathcal{AP}\Omega(T)\), and for any countable c.s.a. by \(T\).</description>

      <title>Moment Dilations and Functional Calculus for Random Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dilation theory for tuples of random operators on a Hilbert space. Their joint distribution defines a moment kernel by expectation of operator products. We prove that this kernel admits a dilation to a Cuntz family of isometries precisely when the associated shifted kernel is dominated in the positive-definite order. As consequences, we establish a mean-square version of von Neumann's inequality and construct a free functional calculus for random operators, extending from polynomials to the free disk algebra and the free Hardy algebra. These results extend classical dilation theory into a probabilistic setting and provide new tools for analyzing noncommutative random systems.</description>

      <title>Higher order perturbation estimates in quasi-Banach Schatten spaces through wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}$. Let $1 \leq p_1, \ldots, p_n &lt; \infty$ and set the H\"older combination $p := (p_1; \ldots ; p_n) := \left( \sum_{j=1}^n p_j^{-1} \right)^{-1}$. Assume further that $0 &lt; p \leq 1$ and that for the H\"older combinations of $p_2$ to $p_n$ and $p_1$ to $p_{n-1}$ we have,
  \[
  1 \leq (p_2; \ldots ; p_n), (p_1; \ldots ; p_{n-1}) &lt; \infty.
  \]
  Then there exists a constant $C&gt; 0$ such that for every $f \in C^n(\mathbb{R}) \cap \dot{B}_{\frac{p}{1-p}, p}^{n-1 + \frac{1}{p}}$ with $\Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty &lt; \infty$ we have \[
  \Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{p_1} \times \ldots \times S_{p_n} \rightarrow S_p \Vert \leq C ( \Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty + \Vert f \Vert_{\dot{B}_{\frac{p}{1-p}, p}^{n-1 + \frac{1}{p}}}). \]
  Here $S_q$ is the Schatten von Neumann class, $\dot{B}_{p,q}^s$ the homogeneous Besov space, and $T_{f^{[n]}}$ is the multilinear Schur multiplier of the $n$-th order divided difference function. In particular, our result holds for $p=1$ and any $1 \leq p_1, \ldots, p_n &lt; \infty$ with $p = (p_1; \ldots; p_n)$.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of weight sharply discards Lavrentiev's gap for double phase functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the smoother the weight, the broader the range of exponents for which the Lavrentiev's gap is absent for the double phase functionals, i.e.,
  $u \mapsto \int_{\Omega} \left(|\nabla u|^p + a(x)|\nabla u|^q\right)\,dx\,, \quad 1 \leq p \leq q &lt; \infty,\, a(\cdot) \geq 0\,.$
  In particular, if $a \in C^\infty$, then no additional restrictions are required on $p$ and $q$. For $a \in C^{k, \alpha}$, we establish the optimal range of exponents, which reads $q \leq p + (k + \alpha)\max(1, p/N)$. Thereby, we extend previously known results which consider H\"older continuous $a$ (i.e., $q \leq p + \alpha\max(1, p/N)$), showing that the range of exponents extends naturally upon imposing more regularity on $a$.</description>

      <title>On uniform summability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a nonempty set of infinite matrices of linear operators between two topological vector spaces. We show that a sequence is uniformly $\mathscr{A}$-summable if and only if it is $B$-summable for all matrices $B$ of linear operators such that the $n$th row of $B$ is the $n$th row for some $A \in \mathscr{A}$. This extends the main result of Bell in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 38 (1973), 548--552]. We also provide several applications including uniform versions of Silverman--Toeplitz theorem, characterizations of almost regular matrices, uniform superior limits, and inclusion of ideal cores. Basically, our methods allow to translate ordinary results into their uniform versions, using directly the former ones.</description>

      <title>Order-generation in posets and convolution of closure operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Hofmann--Lawson theorem, which states that every continuous lattice is inf-generated by its irreducible elements, we explore how to represent posets by extreme points with respect to a closure operator. For this purpose, we introduce the convolution product of closure operators, and prove that the Krein--Milman property can be transferred from one collection of subsets to another by convolution. This result underpins two new representation theorems of topological flavor, which generalize existing ones, even in posets lacking lattice or semilattice structures. We also prove a third representation theorem: given a poset equipped with a closure operator $\mathfrak{c}$ with adequate properties, we show that the set of kit points, defined as an extension of compact points, has the Krein--Milman property with respect to the convolution product of $\mathfrak{c}$ with the dual Alexandrov operator $\uparrow\!\! \cdot$; moreover, every kit point is sup-generated by a unique antichain of compact points, finite if $\mathfrak{c}$ is finitary.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}_q$ denote the quaternionic Heisenberg group with $\mathbb{R}^4\times\mathbb{R}^3$ stratification and $K$ a compact subgroup of Automorphism. We construct the spherical Fourier multiplier related to a Gelfand Pairs on the Quaternionic Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_q$ via the motion group $G=K\ltimes \mathbb{H}_q$ of $\mathbb{H}_q$, where $K\ltimes \mathbb{H}_q$ is the semidirect product of $\mathbb{H}_q$ and its compact subgroup of automorphism $K\in Aut(\mathbb{H}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to a class of $p$-Laplacian Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will prove the existence of infinitely many solutions to the following equation by utilizing the variational perturbation method \begin{equation*} -div(A(x,u)|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+\frac{1}{p}A_{t}(x,u)|\nabla u|^{p}+V(x)|u|^{p-2}u=g(x, u), ~~ x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} where $2&lt;p&lt;N$, $V(x)$ represents a coercive potential. It should be emphasized that the multiplicity of solutions is unsuitable to be discussed under the framework of $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$, as the functional corresponding to the above equation does not satisfy the Palais-Smale condition in this space. To this end, we will use the variational perturbation method to construct novel perturbation space and perturbation functional. By relying on the established conclusions regarding the multiplicity of solutions for classical $p$-Laplacian equations, we shall analyze the equation in question. Our result addresses positively the open question from Candela et. al in CVPDE.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis for pseudo-monotone variational inequality problem involving projections onto a moving ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an iterative scheme that converges to the solution of a pseudo-monotone variational inequality problem in the setting of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Traditional methods often require projections onto the feasible set $\mathfrak{C}$ or onto a half-space containing $\mathfrak{C}$. However, computing projections onto a complicated feasible set can be difficult, and projections onto a half-space may fall outside $\mathfrak{C}$. Keeping this in mind, we aim to develop an iterative scheme that projects onto a ball that is contained in a feasible set and has an explicit expression. Our iterative scheme does not require prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the cost operator. Finally, we provide some numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Interior Spectral Windows and Transport for Discrete Fractional Laplacians on $d$-Dimensional Hypercubic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic fractional discrete Laplacians $\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}$ with exponents $\vec{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. We establish a Mourre estimate on compact energy intervals away from thresholds. As consequences we derive a Limiting Absorption Principle in weighted spaces, propagation estimates (minimal velocity and local decay), and the existence and completeness of local wave operators for perturbations $H=\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}+W(Q)$, where $W$ is an anisotropically decaying potential of long--range type. In the stationary scattering framework we construct the on--shell scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$, prove the optical theorem, and, under a standard trace--class assumption on $W$, establish the Birman--Krein formula $\det S(\lambda)=\exp(-2\pi i\,\xi(\lambda))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be two algebras, let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\mathcal{B}$-bimodule and let $n$ be a positive integer. A linear mapping $D_n:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ is called a strongly generalized derivation of order $n$, if there exist the families $\{E_k:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}\}_{k = 1}^{n}$, $\{H_k:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}\}_{k = 1}^{n}$, $\{F_k:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}\}_{k = 1}^{n}$ and $\{G_k:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}\}_{k = 1}^{n}$ of mappings which satisfy $$D_n(ab) = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}\left[E_k(a) F_k(b) + G_k(a)H_k(b)\right]$$ for all $a, b \in \mathcal{A}$. In this paper, we prove that every strongly generalized derivation of order one from a $C^{\ast}$-algebra into a Banach bimodule is automatically continuous under certain conditions. The main theorem of this paper extends some celebrated results in this regard.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition under which the time marginal of the law of $\mu$-symmetric diffusion process $\mathsf{X}$ in the infinite dimensional configuration space $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is the unique Wasserstein $\mathsf{W}_{2, \mathsf{d}_\mathbf\Upsilon}$ $\mathsf{EVI}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy (a.k.a. Kullback-Leibler divergence) $\mathrm{Ent}_{\mu}$ on the space $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ of probability measures on $\mathbf \Upsilon$. Here, $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is equipped with the $\ell^2$-matching extended distance $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon$ and a Borel probability $\mu$ while $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ is endowed with the transportation extended distance $\mathsf W_{2, \mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon}$ with cost $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon^2$. Our results include the cases $\mu=\mathsf{sine}_2$ and $\mu= \mathsf{Airy}_2$ point processes, where the associated diffusion processes are unlabelled solutions to the infinite-dimensional Dyson-type stochastic differential equations in the bulk and soft-edge limit respectively. As an application, we show that the extended metric measure space $(\mathbf \Upsilon , \mathsf{d}_\mathbf \Upsilon, \mu)$ satisfies the Riemannian curvature-dimension (RCD) condition as well as the distorted Brunn-Minkowski inequality, the HWI inequality and several other functional inequalities. Finally we prove that the time marginal of the law of $\mathsf{X}$ propagates number rigidity and tail triviality.</description>

      <title>Commutant lifting, interpolation, and perturbations on the polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental theorem on commutant lifting due to Sarason does not carry over to the setting of the polydisc. This paper presents two classifications of commutant lifting in several variables. The first classification links the lifting problem to the contractivity of certain linear functionals. The second one transforms it into nonnegative real numbers via a distance formula. We also solve the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem for bounded analytic functions on the polydisc. Along the way, we solve a perturbation problem for bounded analytic functions. Commutant lifting and interpolation on the polydisc solve two well-known problems in Hilbert function space theory.</description>

      <title>Unconditional convergence of general Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: S. Banach, in particular, proved that for any function, even $f(x) = 1,$ where $x\in[0,1],$ the convergence of its Fourier series with respect to the general orthonormal systems (ONS) is not guaranteed. In this paper, we find conditions for the functions $\varphi_{n}$ of an ONS $(\varphi_n),$ under which the Fourier series of functions $f\in Lip_1$ are unconditionally convergent almost everywhere. During our research, we mainly used the properties of the sequences of linear functionals on the Banach spaces to prove the main theorems we presented in this article. Our research has concluded that the aforementioned conditions do exist and are the best possible in a certain sense. We have also found that any ONS contains a subsystem such that the Fourier series of any function $f\in Lip_1$ is unconditionally convergent. Further, the precondition presented in Theorem \ref{theorem1.1}, which demands that the Fourier series of the function $f=1$ be convergent, is adequate, meaning that it does not make the actual conditions of Theorem \ref{theorem1.1} redundant. We have shown that the solution for these types of problems for the general ONS is trivial for the classical ONS (trigonometric, Haar, and Walsh systems).</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Scaling, and Optimal Time-Frequency Concentration: Minimising the Heisenberg Uncertainty in Piecewise-Polynomial and Wavelet Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a hierarchy of function classes defined on a fixed compact interval, along with tailored uncertainty operators. We establish key properties of the associated uncertainty product, showing that it is invariant under scale and translation transformations. Notably, we prove that the infimum of the uncertainty within the asymmetric class is attained in the even subclass. Within two specific wavelet dictionaries, we identify the tent function as the unique minimiser of the time-frequency uncertainty, achieving a value of $U = \frac{3}{10}$. Additionally, we analyse the family of $p$-fold self-convolutions of the rectangle function, $\operatorname{rect}^{\{p\}}$, demonstrating that the uncertainty decreases monotonically towards the Heisenberg bound $ \frac{1}{4} $ as $p \to \infty$. These findings unify and explain various empirical observations from the literature on adaptive wavelet design and Gabor frame stability, and suggest a principled approach to constructing dictionaries with provably optimal joint localisation properties.</description>

      <title>A New Crossnorm That Preserves Unconditional Bases in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a tensor norm (i.e., a uniform reasonable crossnorm) on the class of all algebraic tensor products of Banach spaces $E \otimes F$. We say that $\alpha$ preserves unconditionality if, for every pair of Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ with unconditional Schauder bases (USBs), the completion $E \otimes_{\alpha} F$ also admits a USB. It is well known that none of Grothendieck's fourteen natural tensor norms satisfy this unconditionality-preserving condition. Moreover, the existence of a tensor norm $\alpha$ with this property remains an open question. In this paper, we construct for every such pair $(E,F)$ a new reasonable crossnorm $\alpha$. This norm has the surprising property that -- despite being generally non-uniform -- the space $E \otimes_{\alpha} F$ nevertheless admits a USB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a bounded linear operator $T$ on a separable Banach space with property $(M_p)$, we prove that the smallest and the largest norm of weak cluster points of all maximizing sequences for $T$ can only take the values $0$ or $1$. The three classes of bounded linear operators emerging from the dichotomy of these extremal norm values coincides with the partition, created by considering the norm-attaining property and if the essential norm equals the norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive description of Sobolev-type embeddings for generalized Lorentz-Zygmund spaces on bounded open subsets of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is offered. Rearrangement-invariant spaces, H\"older, Morrey and Campanato type spaces are the classes of range spaces taken into account. Within each of these classes, the optimal target spaces in the relevant embeddings are identified and discussed. This way neat explicit scenarios are developed, which seem to be still missing in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Isometric embeddings of separable Banach spaces into $(\ell^\infty \setminus c)\cup\{0\}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Banach--Mazur theorem asserts that every separable Banach space admits an isometric embedding into $C[0,1]$. It is also well known that every separable Banach space embeds isometrically into $\ell^\infty$. We show that such an embedding can be chosen so that its image intersects $c$ only at the origin. Moreover, we prove that any finite- or countable-dimensional, or more generally separable, subspace of $(\ell^\infty \setminus c)\cup\{0\}$ can be extended to a subspace containing an isometric copy of an arbitrary separable Banach space, while still avoiding $c$. We further establish that this extension property also holds for every subspace $D\subset \ell^\infty$ with $D\cap c=\{0\}$ and separable image in the quotient $\ell^\infty/c$.</description>

      <title>The Multiplicative Kowalski-Slodkowski Theorem for Hermitian Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove, for Hermitian algebras, the multiplicative version of the Kowalski-S\l{}odkowski Theorem which identifies the characters among the collection of all complex valued functions on a Banach algebra $A$ in terms of a spectral condition. Specifically, we show that, if $A$ is a Hermitian algebra, and if $\phi:A\mapsto\mathbb C$ is a continuous function satisfying $\phi(x)\phi(y) \in \sigma(xy)$ for all $x,y\in A$ (where $\sigma$ denotes the spectrum), then either $\phi$ or $-\phi$ is a character of $A$; of course the converse holds as well. Our proof depends fundamentally on the existence of positive elements and square roots in these algebras.</description>

      <title>Data-Adaptive Graph Framelets with Generalized Vanishing Moments for Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing tight framelet systems on graphs with localized supports based on partition trees. Our construction of framelets provides a simple and efficient way to obtain the orthogonality with $k$ arbitrary orthonormal vectors. When the $k$ vectors contain most of the energy of a family of graph signals, the orthogonality of the framelets intuitively possesses ``generalized ($k$-)vanishing'' moments, and thus, the coefficients are sparse. Moreover, our construction provides not only framelets that are overall sparse vectors but also fast and schematically concise transforms. In a data-adaptive setting, the graph framelet systems can be learned by conducting optimizations on Stiefel manifolds to provide the utmost sparsity for a given family of graph signals. Furthermore, we further exploit the generality of our proposed graph framelet systems for heterophilous graph learning, where graphs are characterized by connecting nodes mainly from different classes. The usual assumption that connected nodes are similar and belong to the same class for homophilious graphs is contradictory for heterophilous graphs. Thus, we are motivated to bypass simple assumptions on heterophilous graphs and focus on generating rich node features induced by the graph structure, so as to improve the graph learning ability of certain neural networks in node classification. We derive a specific system of graph framelets and propose a heuristic method to select framelets as features for neural network input. Several experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for non-linear approximation, denoising, and node classification.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present vector-valued concentration inequalities for the biased measure on the discrete hypercube with an optimal dependence on the bias parameter and the Rademacher type of the target Banach space. These results allow us to obtain novel vector-valued concentration inequalities for the measure given by a product of Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we obtain lower bounds on the average distortion with respect to the biased measure of embeddings of the hypercube into Banach spaces of nontrivial type which imply average non-embeddability.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, stochastic algorithms have emerged as scalable and efficient tools for solving large-scale ill-posed inverse problems by randomly selecting subsets of equations at each iteration. However, due to the ill-posedness and measurement noise, these methods often suffer from oscillations and semi-convergence behavior, posing challenges in achieving stable and accurate reconstructions. This study proposes a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, the iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) to address nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method tends to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori information of the noise level. We show that the method terminatesinfinitelymanystepsincaseofnoisydataandhasregularizingfeatures. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.</description>
