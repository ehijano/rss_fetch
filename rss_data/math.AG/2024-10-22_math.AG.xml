      <title>Algebraic Approaches to Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Birational rigidity of quartic three-folds with a double point of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a general three-dimensional quartic $V$ in the complex projective space ${\mathbb P}^4$, the only singularity of which is a double point of rank 3, is a birationally rigid variety. Its group of birational self-maps is, up to the finite subgroup of biregular automorphisms, a free product of 25 cyclic groups of order 2. It follows that the complement to the set of birationally rigid factorial quartics with terminal singularities is of codimension at least 3 in the natural parameter space.</description>

      <title>On vanishing of higher direct images of the structure sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the vanishing of the first direct image of the structure sheaf of a normal excellent scheme $X$ which is mapped properly and birationally over an excellent regular scheme of any dimension. On the other hand, for any dimension greater than two, we show examples of a proper birational morphism from a normal and Cohen-Macaulay scheme to a regular scheme such that the second direct image does not vanish and has an isolated support.</description>

      <title>Liftings of ideals in positive characteristic to those in characteristic zero : Low dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove the finiteness of the set of minimal log discrepancies for a fixed exponent if the dimension is
  less than or equal to three.
  We also prove that the set of log canonical thresholds (lct for short) of ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic
  is contained in the set of lct's of ideals on a smooth variety over C, assuming the dimension is less than or
  equal to three. Under the same dimension assumption, it follows that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational. Our proofs also show the same statements for the higher dimensional case if all such pairs admit log resolutions by a composite of blow-ups by smooth centers.</description>

      <title>Toric Elliptic Pairs with Picard Number Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elliptic pair $(X, C)$ is a generalization of a rational elliptic fibration $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ with fiber $C,$ introduced in \cite{jenia_blowup}. Here, $X$ is a projective rational surface with log terminal singularities, and $C$ is an irreducible curve contained in the smooth locus of $X,$ with $p_a(C)=1$ and $C^2=0.$ These naturally arise as blowups $X:=\text{Bl}_e(\mathbb{P}_\Delta)$ of projective toric surfaces, whose Newton polygon is elliptic. The order of $\mathcal{O}(C)|_C$ in $\text{Pic}^0(C)$ gives a quantitative way to check if $X$ is an elliptic fibration, which is equivalent to finiteness of the order. We call $\Delta$ a Lang-Trotter polygon when this order is infinite, in which case $\overline{\text{Eff}(\text{Bl}_e(\mathbb{P}_\Delta))}$ is non-polyhedral. The paper \cite{lizzie} shows there are exactly $3$ elliptic triangles up to $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}),$ none of which is Lang-Trotter. The paper \cite{jenia_blowup} gives an infinite family of Lang-Trotter pentagons and heptagons, and various examples of other polygons when $\rho(\mathbb{P}_\Delta)&gt;2.$ Remark 4.7 in the paper asks if any Lang-Trotter quadrilaterals exist, and we answer this in the negative by studying the curves in the Zariski Decomposition of $K_X+C.$</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative Deformations of Derived McKay Correspondence for A(n) singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derived McKay correspondence conjecture says that there is an equivalence of triangulated categories between the bounded derived categories of commutative and non-commutative crepant resolutions of a Gorenstein singularity. We will prove that this derived equivalence extends between the semi-universal non-commutative deformations of the commutative and the non-commutative crepant resolutions of a toric surface singularity.</description>

      <title>Equations over Polyhedral Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theory of equations in one variable over polyhedral semirings. The article revolves around a notion of solution to a polynomial equation over a polyhedral semiring. Our main results are a characterisation of local solutions in terms of the coefficients, a local-global principle, and the basics of multiplicity and discriminants. Our primary sources of motivation are tropical geometry and the theory of exceptional points in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the anti-canonical bundle of any $\mathbb Q$-factorial surface is numerically effective if and only if it is pseudo-effective. To prove this, we establish a numerical non-vanishing theorem for surfaces polarized with pseudo-effective divisors. The latter answers a question of C. Fontanari.</description>

      <title>A Proper Definition of Higher Order Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Connelly and Servatius, 1994] shows the difficulty of properly defining n-th order rigidity and flexiblity of a bar-and-joint framework for higher order (n &gt;= 3) through the introduction of a cusp mechanism. The author proposes a "proper" definition of the order of rigidity by the order of elongation of the bars with respect to the arclength along the path in the configuration space. We show that the classic definition using formal n-th derivative of the length constraint is a sufficient condition for the n-th flexiblity in the proposed definition and also a necessary condition only for n = 1, 2.</description>

      <title>Topological obstruction to the training of shallow ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the interplay between the geometry of the loss landscape and the optimization trajectories of simple neural networks is a fundamental step for understanding their behavior in more complex settings. This paper reveals the presence of topological obstruction in the loss landscape of shallow ReLU neural networks trained using gradient flow. We discuss how the homogeneous nature of the ReLU activation function constrains the training trajectories to lie on a product of quadric hypersurfaces whose shape depends on the particular initialization of the network's parameters. When the neural network's output is a single scalar, we prove that these quadrics can have multiple connected components, limiting the set of reachable parameters during training. We analytically compute the number of these components and discuss the possibility of mapping one to the other through neuron rescaling and permutation. In this simple setting, we find that the non-connectedness results in a topological obstruction, which, depending on the initialization, can make the global optimum unreachable. We validate this result with numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field $k$ that has Brauer-Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points. We study the orders of the Brauer classes which capture the obstruction. We prove that one may require elements of arbitrarily large order to capture the obstruction. In other words, the exponent of the group which captures the obstruction has no upper bound.</description>

      <title>Action of free fermions on Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clifford algebra of the endomorphisms of the exterior algebra of a countably dimensional vector space induces natural bosonic shadows, i.e. families of linear maps between the cohomologies of complex grassmannians. The main result of this paper is to provide a determinantal formula expressing generating functions of such endomorphisms unifying several classical special cases. For example the action over a point recovers the Jacobi-Trudy formula in the theory of symmetric functions or the Giambelli's one in classical Schubert calculus, whereas the action of degree preserving endomorphisms take into account the finite type version of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa bosonic vertex operator representation of the Lie algebra $gl(\infty)$. The fermionic actions on (finite type) bosonic spaces is described in terms of the classical theory of symmetric functions. The main guiding principle is the fact that the exterior algebra is a (non irreducible) representation of the ring of symmetric functions, which is the way we use to spell the ``finite type'' Boson-Fermion correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the base change conductor for Jacobians. Through the lens of intersection theory and Deligne's Riemann-Roch theorem, we present novel computational approaches for both the tame and wild parts of the base change conductor. Our key results include a general formula of the tame part, as well as a computation of the wild part in terms of Galois quotients of semistable models of the curves. We treat in detail the case of potential good reduction when the quotient only has weak wild quotient singularities, relying on recent advances by Obus and Wewers.</description>

Abstract: Let F be a complete discretely valued field with residue field a global field or a local field with no real orderings. Let G be an absolutely simple simply connected group of outer type A_n. If 2 and the index of the underlying algebra of G are coprime to the characteristic of the residue field of F, then we prove that the Rost invariant map from the first Galois cohomology set of G to the degree three Galois cohomology group is injective. Let L be the function field of a curve over a local field K and G an absolutely simple simply connected linear algebraic group over L of classical type. Suppose that
  the characteristic of the residue field of K is a good prime for G. As a consequence of our result and some known results we conclude that the Rost invariant of G is injective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear systems of polynomial equations arise naturally in many applied settings, for example loglinear models on contingency tables and Gaussian graphical models. The solution sets to these systems over the reals are often positive dimensional spaces that in general may be very complicated yet have very nice local behavior almost everywhere. Standard methods in real algebraic geometry for describing positive dimensional real solution sets include cylindrical algebraic decomposition and numerical cell decomposition, both of which can be costly to compute in many practical applications. In this work we communicate recent progress towards a Monte Carlo framework for exploring such real solution sets. After describing how to construct probability distributions whose mass focuses on a variety of interest, we describe how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample points near the variety that may then be moved to the variety using endgames. We conclude by showcasing trial experiments using practical implementations of the method in the Bayesian engine Stan.</description>

      <title>Hikita surjectivity for $\mathcal N /// T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian reduction $\mathcal N///T$ of the nilpotent cone in $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ by the torus of diagonal matrices is a Nakajima quiver variety which admits a symplectic resolution $\widetilde{\mathcal N///T}$, and the corresponding BFN Coulomb branch is the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ of the cotangent bundle of the base affine space. We construct a surjective map $\mathbb C\left[\overline{T^*(G/U)}^{T\times B/U}\right] \twoheadrightarrow H^*\left(\widetilde{\mathcal N /// T}\right)$ of graded algebras, which the Hikita conjecture predicts to be an isomorphism. Our map is inherited from a related case of the Hikita conjecture and factors through Kirwan surjectivity for quiver varieties. We conjecture that many other Hikita maps can be inherited from that of a related dual pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a description of the formal neighborhoods of the components of the boundary divisor in the Deligne-Mumford moduli stack $\overline{{\mathcal M}}_g$ of stable curves in terms of the extended clutching construction that we define. This construction can be viewed as a formal version of the analytic plumbing construction. The advantage of our formal construction is that we can control the effect of changing formal parameters at the marked points that are being glued. As an application, we prove that the infinitesimal neighborhood of the boundary component $\Delta_{1,1}$ in $\overline{{\mathcal M}}_2$ is canonically isomorphic to the infinitesimal neighborhood of the zero section in the normal bundle. As another application, we show how to study the period map near the boundary components $\Delta_{g_1,g_2}$ in terms of the coordinates coming from our extended clutching construction.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of semi-orthogonal decompositions of bounded derived categories of singular varieties under flat deformations to smooth varieties. We consider a Q-Gorenstein smoothing of a surface with a quotient singularity, and prove that a pretilting sheaf, which is constructed from a non-commutative deformation of a divisorial sheaf and generates a semi-orthogonal component of a bounded derived category, deforms to a direct sum of exceptional vector bundles which are mutually totally orthogonal.</description>

      <title>Rigid currents on compact hyperkahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rigid cohomology class on a complex manifold is a class that is represented by a unique closed positive current. The positive current representing a rigid class is also called rigid. For a compact Kahler manifold $X$ all eigenvectors of hyperbolic automorphisms acting on $H^{1,1}(X)$ that have non-unit eigenvalues are rigid classes. Such classes are always parabolic, namely, they belong to the boundary of the Kahler cone and have vanishing volume. We study parabolic $(1,1)$-classes on compact hyperkahler manifolds with $b_2 \geq 7$. We show that a parabolic class is rigid if it is not orthogonal to a rational vector with respect to the BBF form. This implies that a general parabolic class on a hyperkahler manifold is rigid.</description>

Abstract: We prove a comparison theorem between the \'etale cohomology of algebraic varieties over Stein compacta and the singular cohomology of their analytifications. We deduce that the field of meromorphic functions in a neighborhood of a connected Stein compact subset of a normal complex space of dimension $n$ has cohomological dimension $n$. As an application of $\textrm{Gal}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R})$-equivariant variants of these results, we obtain a quantitative version of Hilbert's 17th problem on compact subsets of real-analytic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant cycle curves on a K3 surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ have been introduced by Huybrechts (2014) as curves whose points all define the same class in the Chow group. In this paper we study correspondences $Z \subseteq X\times X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ acting on the group $\mbox{ccc}(X)$ of cycles generated by irreducible constant cycle curves. We construct for any $n\geq 2$ and any very ample line bundle $L$ a locus $Z_n(L)\subseteq X\times X$ of expected dimension $2$, which yields a correspondence that acts on $\mbox{ccc}(X)$, when it has the expected dimension. We provide examples of $Z_n(L)$ for low $n$ and exhibit one correspondence different from $Z_n(L)$ acting on $\mbox{ccc}(X)$.</description>

Abstract: This article presents two key computations in MW-motivic cohomology. Firstly, we compute the MW-motivic cohomology of the symplectic groups $Sp_{2n}$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ using the $Sp$-orientation and the associated Borel classes. Secondly, following the classical computations and using the analogue in $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy of the Leray spectral sequence, we compute the $\eta$-inverted MW-motivic cohomology of general Stiefel varieties, obtaining in particular the computation of the $\eta$-inverted MW-motivic cohomology of the general linear groups $GL_n$ and the special linear groups $SL_n$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Finally, we determine the multiplicative structures of these total cohomology groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop canonical bundle formulas for fibrations of relative dimension one in characteristic $p&gt;0$. For such a fibration from a log pair $f\colon (X, \Delta) \to S$, if $f$ is separable, we can obtain a formula similar to the one due to Witaszek \cite{Wit21}; if $f$ is inseparable, we treat the case when $S$ is of maximal Albanese dimension. As an application, we prove that for a klt pair $(X,\Delta)$ with $-(K_X+\Delta)$ nef, if the Albanese morphism $a_X\colon X \to A$ is of relative dimension one, then $X$ is a fiber space over $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brill-Noether loci ${\mathcal M}^r_{g,d}$ are those subsets of the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_g$ determined by the existence of a linear series of degree $d$ and dimension $r$. By looking at non-singular curves in a neighborhood of a special chain of elliptic curves, we provide a new proof of the non-emptiness of the Brill-Noether loci when the expected codimension satisfies $-g+r+1\le \rho(g,r,d)\le 0$ and prove that for a generic point of a component of this locus, the Petri map is onto. As an application, we show that Brill-Noether loci of the same codimension are distinct when the codimension is not too large, substantially generalizing the known result in codimensions 1 and 2. We also provide a new technique for checking that Brill-Noether loci are not included in each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space of stable rational curves with marked points has two distinguished families of maps: the forgetful maps, given by forgetting some of the markings, and the Kapranov maps, given by complete linear series of $\psi$-classes. The collection of all these maps embeds the moduli space into a product of projective spaces. We call the multidegrees of this embedding ``Kapranov degrees,'' which include as special cases the work of Witten, Silversmith, Gallet--Grasegger--Schicho, Castravet--Tevelev, Postnikov, Cavalieri--Gillespie--Monin, and Gillespie--Griffins--Levinson. We establish, in terms of a combinatorial matching condition, upper bounds for Kapranov degrees and a characterization of their positivity. The positivity characterization answers a question of Silversmith and gives a new proof of Laman's theorem characterizing generically rigid graphs in the plane. We achieve this by proving a recursive formula for Kapranov degrees and by using tools from the theory of error correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of tropical extensions of hyperfields, including the ordinary, signed and complex tropical hyperfields. We introduce the framework of 'enriched valuations' as hyperfield homomorphisms to tropical extensions, and show that a notable family of them are relatively algebraically closed. Our main results are hyperfield analogues of Kapranov's theorem and the Fundamental theorem of tropical geometry. Utilising these theorems, we introduce fine tropical varieties and prove a structure theorem for them in terms of their initial ideals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10515v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a classical construction in real algebraic geometry. Although there are many algorithms to compute a cylindrical algebraic decomposition, their practical performance is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit this problem from a more geometric perspective, where the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition is related to the study of morphisms between real varieties. It is showed that the geometric fiber cardinality (geometric property) decides the existence of semi-algebraic continuous sections (semi-algebraic property). As a result, all equations can be systematically exploited in the projection phase, leading to a new simple algorithm whose efficiency is demonstrated by experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian statistical models whose log-likelihood function has a unique complex critical point, i.e., has maximum likelihood degree one. We exploit the connection developed by Am\'endola et. al. between the models having maximum likelihood degree one and homaloidal polynomials. We study the spanning tree generating function of a graph and show this polynomial is homaloidal when the graph is chordal. When the graph is a cycle on $n$ vertices, $n \geq 4$, we prove the polynomial is not homaloidal, and show that the maximum likelihood degree of the resulting model is the $n$th Eulerian number. These results support our conjecture that the spanning tree generating function is a homaloidal polynomial if and only if the graph is chordal. We also provide an algebraic formulation for the defining equations of these models. Using existing results, we provide a computational study on constructing new families of homaloidal polynomials. In the end, we analyze the symmetric determinantal representation of such polynomials and provide an upper bound on the size of the matrices involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for a Brauer-Severi surface bundle over a rational 3-fold to not be stably rational. Additionally, we present an example that satisfies this condition and demonstrate the existence of families of Brauer-Severi surface bundles whose general members are smooth and not stably rational.</description>

      <title>Stringy Hodge numbers of Pfaffian double mirrors and Homological Projective Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stringy Hodge numbers of Pfaffian double mirrors, generalizing previous results of Borisov and Libgober. In the even-dimensional cases, we introduce a modified version of stringy $E$-functions and obtain interesting relations between the modified stringy $E$-functions on the two sides. We use them to make numerical predictions on the Lefschetz decompositions of the categorical crepant resolutions of Pfaffian varieties.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the category of ind-coherent sheaves on a quasi-smooth scheme is naturally tensored over the category of sheared D-modules on its shifted cotangent bundle, commuting with its natural action of categorified Hoschschild cochains. We prove that it defines a Morita equivalence as such. We then extend these results to quasi-smooth Artin stacks.
  As a consequence of our formalism, we are able to articulate a precise sense in which the space of unramified automorphic functions over a function field localizes over the stack of arithmetic Arthur parameters.</description>

      <title>Hilbert irreducibility for integral points on punctured linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, let $X$ be a smooth integral variety over $K$, and assume that there exists a finite set of finite places $S$ of $K$ such that the $S$-integral points on $X$ are dense. Then the combined conjectures of Campana and Corvaja-Zannier predict that, for every closed subscheme $Z$ of $X$ of codimension at least two, there exists a finite extension $L$ of $K$ and a finite set of finite places $T$ of $L$ such that the $T$-integral points on $(X\setminus Z)_L$ are not strongly thin. The main goal of the present paper is to show that this property holds for all connected linear algebraic groups. Our result builds mainly on recent work on a Hilbert irreducibility type theorem for connected algebraic groups, the purity of strong approximation for semi-simple simply connected quasi-split linear algebraic groups, and the relation between integral strong approximation and the Hilbert property.</description>

Abstract: In the setting of the non-archimedean SYZ mirror construction (arXiv:2003.06106), we prove the folklore conjecture that the critical values of the mirror superpotential are the eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication by the first Chern class. Our result relies on a weak unobstructed assumption, but it is usually ensured in practice by Solomon's results on anti-symmetric Lagrangians. Lastly, we note that some explicit examples are presented in the recent work (arXiv:2206.04652).</description>

      <title>Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert varieties of parahoric group schemes and twisted global Demazure modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a parahoric Bruhat-Tits group schemes arising from a $\Gamma$-curve $C$ and a certain $\Gamma$-action on a simple algebraic group $G$ for some finite cyclic group $\Gamma$. We prove the flatness of Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert varieties of $\mathcal{G}$, we determine the rigidified Picard group of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}_{\mathcal{G},C^n}$ of $\mathcal{G}$, and we establish the factorizable and equivariant structures on rigidified line bundles on ${\rm Gr}_{\mathcal{G},C^n}$.
  We develop an algebraic theory of global Demazure modules of twisted current algebras, and using our geometric results we prove that when $C = \mathbb{A}^1$, the spaces of global sections of line bundles on BD Schubert varieties of $\mathcal{G}$ are dual to the twisted global Demazure modules. This generalizes the work of Dumanski-Feigin-Finkelberg in the untwisted setting,</description>

      <title>Integers expressible as the sum of two rational cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a positive proportion of integers are expressible as the sum of two rational cubes, and a positive proportion are not so expressible, thus proving a conjecture of Davenport. More generally, we prove that a positive proportion (in fact, at least one sixth) of elliptic curves in any cubic twist family have rank 0, and a positive proportion (in fact, at least one sixth) of elliptic curves with good reduction at 2 in any cubic twist family have rank 1.
  Our method involves proving that the average size of the 2-Selmer group of elliptic curves in any cubic twist family, having any given root number, is 3. We accomplish this by generalizing a parametrization, due to the second author and Ho, of elliptic curves with extra structure by pairs of binary cubic forms. We then use a novel combination of geometry-of-numbers methods and the circle method that builds on earlier work of Ruth and the first author. In particular, we make use of a new interpretation of the singular integral and series arising in the circle method in terms of real and $p$-adic Haar measures on the relevant group. We prove a uniformity estimate for integral points on the relevant quadric, which along with a sieve allows us to prove that the average size of the 2-Selmer group over the cubic twist family is 3. By suitably partitioning the subset of curves in the family with given root number, we effect a further sieve to show that the root number is equidistributed and that the same average, now taken over only those curves of given root number, is again 3. Finally, we apply the $p$-parity theorem of Dokchitser-Dokchitser and a $p$-converse theorem of Burungale-Skinner to conclude.
  We also prove the analogue of the above results for the sequence of square numbers: namely, we prove that a positive proportion of square integers are expressible as the sum of two rational cubes, and a positive proportion are not.</description>

      <title>Pseudolimits for Tangent Categories and Equivariant Tangents for Varieties and Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if $\mathscr{C}$ is a category and if $F\colon\mathscr{C} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ is a pseudofunctor such that for each object $X$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the category $F(X)$ is a tangent category and for each morphism $f$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the functor $F(f)$ is part of a strong tangent morphism $(F(f),\!{}_{f}{\alpha})$ and that furthermore the natural transformations $\!{}_{f}{\alpha}$ vary pseudonaturally in $\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}}$, then there is a tangent structure on the pseudolimit $\mathbf{PC}(F)$ which is induced by the tangent structures on the categories $F(X)$ together with how they vary through the functors $F(f)$. We use this observation to show that the forgetful $2$-functor $\operatorname{Forget}:\mathfrak{Tan} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ creates and preserves pseudolimits indexed by $1$-categories. As an application, this allows us to describe how equivariant descent interacts with the tangent structures on the category of smooth (real) manifolds and on various categories of (algebraic) varieties over a field.</description>

      <title>The Nullstellensatz and Positivstellensatz for Sparse Tropical Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grigoriev and Podolskii (2018) have established a tropical analogue of the effective Nullstellensatz, showing that a system of tropical polynomial equations is solvable if and only if a linearized system obtained from a truncated Macaulay matrix is solvable. They provided an upper bound of the minimal admissible truncation degree, as a function of the degrees of the tropical polynomials. We establish a tropical Nullstellensatz adapted to {\em sparse} tropical polynomial systems. Our approach is inspired by a construction of Canny-Emiris (1993), refined by Sturmfels (1994). This leads to an improved bound of the truncation degree, which coincides with the classical Macaulay degree in the case of $n+1$ equations in $n$ unknowns. We also establish a tropical Positivstellensatz, allowing one to decide the inclusion of tropical basic semialgebraic sets. This allows one to reduce decision problems for tropical semi-algebraic sets to the solution of systems of tropical linear equalities and inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the strongly regular locus of the inertia stack of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We show that for each $b \in B(G)$, the strongly regular locus of the inertia stack of $\mathrm{Bun}_G^b$ is open in the inertia stack of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$. As a consequence, we extend the computation of Hansen--Kaletha--Weinstein of trace distributions of the cohomology of local shtuka spaces $\mathrm{Sht}_{G,b,\mu}$ to non-basic $b$ and in some cases beyond the elliptic locus. If $b$ is closed in $B(G,\mu)$, or $b$ is basic and has only one specialization in $B(G,\mu)$, then we compute the trace distribution of the entire strongly regular locus. In the process, we prove some results on the behavior of characteristic classes under cohomologically smooth pullback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest highly nontrivial relations between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbasch and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $X^\vee= S_{e^\vee}$ and $X=$ Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $X^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra of rank $N$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Associated to $\mathcal{L}$ is a family of polynomial folding maps $$\textsf{F}_{n}:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N\quad\text{for}\quad n\ge1$$ having the property that $\textsf{F}_{n}$ has topological degree $n^N$ and $$\textsf{F}_{m}\circ\textsf{F}_{n}=\textsf{F}_{n}\circ\textsf{F}_{m}\quad\text{for all}\quad m,n\ge1.$$ We derive formulas for the leading terms of the folding maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$ associated to the Lie algebras $\mathcal{A}_2$, $\mathcal{B}_2$, and $\mathcal{G}_2$, and we use these formulas to compute the affine automorphism group of each folding map.</description>
