      <title>Cer-Eval: Certifiable and Cost-Efficient Evaluation Framework for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As foundation models continue to scale, the size of trained models grows exponentially, presenting significant challenges for their evaluation. Current evaluation practices involve curating increasingly large datasets to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and guidance on determining the sufficiency of test data or selecting informative samples for evaluation. This paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for LLMs. Our framework adapts to different evaluation objectives and outputs confidence intervals that contain true values with high probability. We use ``test sample complexity'' to quantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and derive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory, we develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects test points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% test points across various benchmarks, while maintaining an estimation error level comparable to the current evaluation process and providing a 95% confidence guarantee.</description>

      <title>Variational Formulation of the Particle Flow Particle Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a formulation of the particle flow particle filter from the perspective of variational inference. We show that the transient density used to derive the particle flow particle filter follows a time-scaled trajectory of the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in the space of probability densities. The Fisher-Rao gradient flow is obtained as a continuous-time algorithm for variational inference, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational density and the true posterior density.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Discriminative Clustering and Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To cluster data is to separate samples into distinctive groups that should ideally have some cohesive properties. Today, numerous clustering algorithms exist, and their differences lie essentially in what can be perceived as ``cohesive properties''. Therefore, hypotheses on the nature of clusters must be set: they can be either generative or discriminative. As the last decade witnessed the impressive growth of deep clustering methods that involve neural networks to handle high-dimensional data often in a discriminative manner; we concentrate mainly on the discriminative hypotheses. In this paper, our aim is to provide an accessible historical perspective on the evolution of discriminative clustering methods and notably how the nature of assumptions of the discriminative models changed over time: from decision boundaries to invariance critics. We notably highlight how mutual information has been a historical cornerstone of the progress of (deep) discriminative clustering methods. We also show some known limitations of mutual information and how discriminative clustering methods tried to circumvent those. We then discuss the challenges that discriminative clustering faces with respect to the selection of the number of clusters. Finally, we showcase these techniques using the dedicated Python package, GemClus, that we have developed for discriminative clustering.</description>

      <title>From Two Sample Testing to Singular Gaussian Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a general separable and compact metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two corresponding Gaussian measures on a suitable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel mean and covariance embedding of a probability measure. Discerning two singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Our proof leverages the Feldman-Hajek criterion for singularity/equivalence of Gaussians on Hilbert spaces, and shows that discrepancies between distributions are heavily magnified through their corresponding Gaussian embeddings: at a population level, distinct probability measures lead to essentially separated Gaussian embeddings. This appears to be a new instance of the blessing of dimensionality that can be harnessed for the design of efficient inference tools in great generality.</description>

      <title>On the Residual-based Neural Network for Unmodeled Distortions in Coordinate Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinate transformation models often fail to account for nonlinear and spatially dependent distortions, leading to significant residual errors in geospatial applications. Here we propose a residual-based neural correction strategy, in which a neural network learns to model only the systematic distortions left by an initial geometric transformation. By focusing solely on residual patterns, the proposed method reduces model complexity and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse or structured control point configurations. We evaluate the method using both simulated datasets with varying distortion intensities and sampling strategies, as well as under the real-world image georeferencing tasks. Compared with direct neural network coordinate converter and classical transformation models, the residual-based neural correction delivers more accurate and stable results under challenging conditions, while maintaining comparable performance in ideal cases. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of residual modelling as a lightweight and robust alternative for improving coordinate transformation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Utilising Gradient-Based Proposals Within Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Training of Partial Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs) have been shown to perform competitively with fully Bayesian neural networks while only having a subset of the parameters be stochastic. Using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers as the inference method for pBNNs gives a non-parametric probabilistic estimation of the stochastic parameters, and has shown improved performance over parametric methods. In this paper we introduce a new SMC-based training method for pBNNs by utilising a guided proposal and incorporating gradient-based Markov kernels, which gives us better scalability on high dimensional problems. We show that our new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of predictive performance and optimal loss. We also show that pBNNs scale well with larger batch sizes, resulting in significantly reduced training times and often better performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This lecture note is intended to prepare early-year master's and PhD students in data science or a related discipline with foundational ideas in machine learning. It starts with basic ideas in modern machine learning with classification as a main target task. These basic ideas include loss formulation, backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, generalization, model selection as well as fundamental blocks of artificial neural networks. Based on these basic ideas, the lecture note explores in depth the probablistic approach to unsupervised learning, covering directed latent variable models, product of experts, generative adversarial networks and autoregressive models. Finally, the note ends by covering a diverse set of further topics, such as reinforcement learning, ensemble methods and meta-learning.

      <title>PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for fully connected deep neural network with Gaussian priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful methodology with significant practical successes in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recent works have demonstrated that sparsely connected DNNs with carefully designed architectures can achieve minimax estimation rates under classical smoothness assumptions. However, subsequent studies revealed that simple fully connected DNNs can achieve comparable convergence rates, challenging the necessity of sparsity. Theoretical advances in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have been more fragmented. Much of those work has concentrated on sparse networks, leaving the theoretical properties of fully connected BNNs underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating fully connected Bayesian DNNs with Gaussian prior using PAC-Bayes bounds. We establish upper bounds on the prediction risk for a probabilistic deep neural network method, showing that these bounds match (up to logarithmic factors) the minimax-optimal rates in Besov space, for both nonparametric regression and binary classification with logistic loss. Importantly, our results hold for a broad class of practical activation functions that are Lipschitz continuous.</description>

      <title>Localized Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Distributions Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Guarantees for LT-TTD: A Unified Transformer-based Architecture for Two-Level Ranking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommendation and search systems typically employ multi-stage ranking architectures to efficiently handle billions of candidates. The conventional approach uses distinct L1 (candidate retrieval) and L2 (re-ranking) models with different optimization objectives, introducing critical limitations including irreversible error propagation and suboptimal ranking. This paper identifies and analyzes the fundamental limitations of this decoupled paradigm and proposes LT-TTD (Listwise Transformer with Two-Tower Distillation), a novel unified architecture that bridges retrieval and ranking phases. Our approach combines the computational efficiency of two-tower models with the expressivity of transformers in a unified listwise learning framework. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of our architecture and establish formal guarantees regarding error propagation mitigation, ranking quality improvements, and optimization convergence. We derive theoretical bounds showing that LT-TTD reduces the upper limit on irretrievable relevant items by a factor that depends on the knowledge distillation strength, and prove that our multi-objective optimization framework achieves a provably better global optimum than disjoint training. Additionally, we analyze the computational complexity of our approach, demonstrating that the asymptotic complexity remains within practical bounds for real-world applications. We also introduce UPQE, a novel evaluation metric specifically designed for unified ranking architectures that holistically captures retrieval quality, ranking performance, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Extreme Quantiles and the Exceedance Distribution for Paretian Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating extreme quantiles is an important task in many applications, including financial risk management and climatology. More important than estimating the quantile itself is to insure zero coverage error, which implies the quantile estimate should, on average, reflect the desired probability of exceedance. In this research, we show that for unconditional distributions isomorphic to the exponential, a Bayesian quantile estimate results in zero coverage error. This compares to the traditional maximum likelihood method, where the coverage error can be significant under small sample sizes even though the quantile estimate is unbiased. More generally, we prove a sufficient condition for an unbiased quantile estimator to result in coverage error. Interestingly, our results hold by virtue of using a Jeffreys prior for the unknown parameters and is independent of the true prior. We also derive an expression for the distribution, and moments, of future exceedances which is vital for risk assessment. We extend our results to the conditional tail of distributions with asymptotic Paretian tails and, in particular, those in the Fr\'echet maximum domain of attraction. We illustrate our results using simulations for a variety of light and heavy-tailed distributions.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Free Adaptive Bayesian Inference via Nonparametric Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the likelihood is analytically unavailable and computationally intractable, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has emerged as a widely used methodology for approximate posterior inference; however, it suffers from severe computational inefficiency in high-dimensional settings or under diffuse priors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Bayesian Inference (ABI), a framework that bypasses traditional data-space discrepancies and instead compares distributions directly in posterior space through nonparametric distribution matching. By leveraging a novel Marginally-augmented Sliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance on posterior measures and exploiting its quantile representation, ABI transforms the challenging problem of measuring divergence between posterior distributions into a tractable sequence of one-dimensional conditional quantile regression tasks. Moreover, we introduce a new adaptive rejection sampling scheme that iteratively refines the posterior approximation by updating the proposal distribution via generative density estimation. Theoretically, we establish parametric convergence rates for the trimmed MSW distance and prove that the ABI posterior converges to the true posterior as the tolerance threshold vanishes. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ABI significantly outperforms data-based Wasserstein ABC, summary-based ABC, and state-of-the-art likelihood-free simulators, especially in high-dimensional or dependent observation regimes.</description>

      <title>WATCH: Weighted Adaptive Testing for Changepoint Hypotheses via Weighted-Conformal Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but moreover continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria,'' such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions, or do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Bayesian Optimization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.11792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian optimization (BO) in one dimension, under a Gaussian process prior and Gaussian sampling noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, under fairly mild technical assumptions on the kernel, the best possible cumulative regret up to time $T$ behaves as $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$. This gives a tight characterization up to a $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor, and includes the first non-trivial lower bound for noisy BO. Our assumptions are satisfied, for example, by the squared exponential and Mat\'ern-$\nu$ kernels, with the latter requiring $\nu &gt; 2$. Our results certify the near-optimality of existing bounds (Srinivas {\em et al.}, 2009) for the SE kernel, while proving them to be strictly suboptimal for the Mat\'ern kernel with $\nu &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Welfare Analysis in Dynamic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.09173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces metrics for welfare analysis in dynamic models. We develop estimation and inference for these parameters even in the presence of a high-dimensional state space. Examples of welfare metrics include average welfare, average marginal welfare effects, and welfare decompositions into direct and indirect effects similar to Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). We derive dual and doubly robust representations of welfare metrics that facilitate debiased inference. For average welfare, the value function does not have to be estimated. In general, debiasing can be applied to any estimator of the value function, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In particular, we derive Lasso and Neural Network estimators of the value function and associated dynamic dual representation and establish associated mean square convergence rates for these functions. Debiasing is automatic in the sense that it only requires knowledge of the welfare metric of interest, not the form of bias correction. The proposed methods are applied to estimate a dynamic behavioral model of teacher absenteeism in \cite{DHR} and associated average teacher welfare.</description>

      <title>On Understanding Attention-Based In-Context Learning for Categorical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning based on attention models is examined for data with categorical outcomes, with inference in such models viewed from the perspective of functional gradient descent (GD). We develop a network composed of attention blocks, with each block employing a self-attention layer followed by a cross-attention layer, with associated skip connections. This model can exactly perform multi-step functional GD inference for in-context inference with categorical observations. We perform a theoretical analysis of this setup, generalizing many prior assumptions in this line of work, including the class of attention mechanisms for which it is appropriate. We demonstrate the framework empirically on synthetic data, image classification and language generation.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for marginals on large graphical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many spatial models exhibit locality structures that effectively reduce their intrinsic dimensionality, enabling efficient approximation and sampling of high-dimensional distributions. However, existing approximation techniques mainly focus on joint distributions, and do not guarantee accuracy for low-dimensional marginals. By leveraging the locality structures, we establish a dimension independent uniform error bound for the marginals of approximate distributions. Inspired by the Stein's method, we introduce a novel $\delta$-locality condition that quantifies the locality in distributions, and link it to the structural assumptions such as the sparse graphical models. The theoretical guarantee motivates the localization of existing sampling methods, as we illustrate through the localized likelihood-informed subspace method and localized score matching. We show that by leveraging the locality structure, these methods greatly reduce the sample complexity and computational cost via localized and parallel implementations.</description>

      <title>Ranked differences Pearson correlation dissimilarity with an application to electricity users time series clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach called multi-modal cascade model with feature transfer for polymer property prediction.Polymers are characterized by a composite of data in several different formats, including molecular descriptors and additive information as well as chemical structures. However, in conventional approaches, prediction models were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model enables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by combining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive information. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method shows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional approach using a single feature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) that are crucial for cryptographic applications have been the subject of adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit environmental information to predict generated random numbers that are supposed to be truly random and unpredictable. Though quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are based on the intrinsic indeterministic nature of quantum properties, the presence of classical noise in the measurement process compromises the integrity of a QRNG. In this paper, we develop a predictive machine learning (ML) analysis to investigate the impact of deterministic classical noise in different stages of an optical continuous variable QRNG. Our ML model successfully detects inherent correlations when the deterministic noise sources are prominent. After appropriate filtering and randomness extraction processes are introduced, our QRNG system, in turn, demonstrates its robustness against ML. We further demonstrate the robustness of our ML approach by applying it to uniformly distributed random numbers from the QRNG and a congruential RNG. Hence, our result shows that ML has potentials in benchmarking the quality of RNG devices.</description>

      <title>Disjunctive Branch-And-Bound for Certifiably Optimal Low-Rank Matrix Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion consists of computing a matrix of minimal complexity that recovers a given set of observations as accurately as possible. Unfortunately, existing methods for matrix completion are heuristics that, while highly scalable and often identifying high-quality solutions, do not possess any optimality guarantees. We reexamine matrix completion with an optimality-oriented eye. We reformulate low-rank matrix completion problems as convex problems over the non-convex set of projection matrices and implement a disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme that solves them to certifiable optimality. Further, we derive a novel and often near-exact class of convex relaxations by decomposing a low-rank matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices and incentivizing that two-by-two minors in each rank-one matrix have determinant zero. In numerical experiments, our new convex relaxations decrease the optimality gap by two orders of magnitude compared to existing attempts, and our disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme solves $n \times m$ rank-$r$ matrix completion problems to certifiable optimality or near optimality in hours for $\max \{m, n\} \leq 2500$ and $r \leq 5$. Moreover, this improvement in the training error translates into an average $2\%$--$50\%$ improvement in the test set error.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviours accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields an approximate closure of the dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the accuracy and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's improved predictive capability for flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the functional linear regression model with a scalar response and a Hilbert space-valued predictor, a canonical example of an ill-posed inverse problem. We show that the functional partial least squares (PLS) estimator attains nearly minimax-optimal convergence rates over a class of ellipsoids and propose an adaptive early stopping procedure for selecting the number of PLS components. In addition, we develop new test that can detect local alternatives converging at the parametric rate which can be inverted to construct confidence sets. Simulation results demonstrate that the estimator performs favorably relative to several existing methods and the proposed test exhibits good power properties. We apply our methodology to evaluate the nonlinear effects of temperature on corn and soybean yields.</description>

      <title>Double Cross-fit Doubly Robust Estimators: Beyond Series Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doubly robust estimators with cross-fitting have gained popularity in causal inference due to their favorable structure-agnostic error guarantees. However, when additional structure, such as H\"{o}lder smoothness, is available then more accurate "double cross-fit doubly robust" (DCDR) estimators can be constructed by splitting the training data and undersmoothing nuisance function estimators on independent samples. We study a DCDR estimator of the Expected Conditional Covariance, a functional of interest in causal inference and conditional independence testing. We first provide a structure-agnostic error analysis for the DCDR estimator with no assumptions on the nuisance functions or their estimators. Then, assuming the nuisance functions are H\"{o}lder smooth, but without assuming knowledge of the true smoothness level or the covariate density, we establish that DCDR estimators with several linear smoothers are $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under minimal conditions and achieve fast convergence rates in the non-$\sqrt{n}$ regime. When the covariate density and smoothnesses are known, we propose a minimax rate-optimal DCDR estimator based on undersmoothed kernel regression. Moreover, we show an undersmoothed DCDR estimator satisfies a slower-than-$\sqrt{n}$ central limit theorem, and that inference is possible even in the non-$\sqrt{n}$ regime. Finally, we support our theoretical results with simulations, providing intuition for double cross-fitting and undersmoothing, demonstrating where our estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency while the usual "single cross-fit" estimator fails, and illustrating asymptotic normality for the undersmoothed DCDR estimator.</description>

      <title>Randomized Transport Plans via Hierarchical Fully Probabilistic Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optimal randomized strategy for design of balanced, normalized mass transport plans is developed. It replaces -- but specializes to -- the deterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a certainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore uncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore, hierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal hyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent with prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This Bayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call HFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the generation of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized marginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent measures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in fair market matching is outlined, in which HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a more diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into the delivery of an expected plan.</description>

      <title>Batched Bayesian optimization by maximizing the probability of including the optimum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Batched Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate molecular design by efficiently identifying top-performing compounds from a large chemical library. Existing acquisition strategies for batch design in BO aim to balance exploration and exploitation. This often involves optimizing non-additive batch acquisition functions, necessitating approximation via myopic construction and/or diversity heuristics. In this work, we propose an acquisition strategy for discrete optimization that is motivated by pure exploitation, qPO (multipoint Probability of Optimality). qPO maximizes the probability that the batch includes the true optimum, which is expressible as the sum over individual acquisition scores and thereby circumvents the combinatorial challenge of optimizing a batch acquisition function. We differentiate the proposed strategy from parallel Thompson sampling and discuss how it implicitly captures diversity. Finally, we apply our method to the model-guided exploration of large chemical libraries and provide empirical evidence that it is competitive with and complements other state-of-the-art methods in batched Bayesian optimization.</description>

Abstract: Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.</description>

      <title>Federated Generalised Variational Inference: A Robust Probabilistic Federated Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FedGVI, a probabilistic Federated Learning (FL) framework that is robust to both prior and likelihood misspecification. FedGVI addresses limitations in both frequentist and Bayesian FL by providing unbiased predictions under model misspecification, with calibrated uncertainty quantification. Our approach generalises previous FL approaches, specifically Partitioned Variational Inference (Ashman et al., 2022), by allowing robust and conjugate updates, decreasing computational complexity at the clients. We offer theoretical analysis in terms of fixed-point convergence, optimality of the cavity distribution, and provable robustness to likelihood misspecification. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FedGVI in terms of improved robustness and predictive performance on multiple synthetic and real world classification data sets.</description>

      <title>Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.</description>
