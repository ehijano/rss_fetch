      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>

Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms of interest, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate hard-to-interpret or even biologically unrealistic predictions. Out of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred comprise the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Here, focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present a manually-curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied prokaryote Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations, as well as a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, here we assess the properties of this model in relation to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>
