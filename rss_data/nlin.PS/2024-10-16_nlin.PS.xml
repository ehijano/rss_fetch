      <title>Travelling waves and wave pinning (polarity): Switching between random and directional cell motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a simple model of actin waves consisting of three partial differential equations (PDEs) for active and inactive GTPase promoting growth of filamentous actin (F-actin, $F$). The F-actin feeds back to inactivate the GTPase at rate $sF$, where $s\ge 0$ is a ``negative feedback'' parameter. In contrast to previous models for actin waves, the simplicity of this model and its geometry (1D periodic cell perimeter) permits a full PDE bifurcation analysis. Based on a combination of continuation methods, linear stability analysis, and PDE simulations, we explore the existence, stability, interactions, and transitions between homogeneous steady states (resting cells), wave-pinning (polar cells), and travelling waves (cells with ruffling protrusions). We show that the value of $s$ and the size of the cell (length of perimeter) can affect the existence, coexistence, and stability of the patterns, as well as dominance of the one or another cell state. Implications to motile cells are discussed.</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and vortices in a tri-core nonlinear fractional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a waveguiding system composed of three linearly-coupled fractional waveguides, with a triangular (prismatic) transverse structure. It may be realized as a tri-core nonlinear optical fiber with fractional group-velocity dispersion (GVD), or, possibly, as a system of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations for a set of three tunnel-coupled cigar-shaped traps filled by a Bose-Einstein condensate of particles moving by L\'evy flights. The analysis is focused on the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) between components of triple solitons, and the formation and stability of vortex modes. In the self-focusing regime, we identify symmetric and asymmetric soliton states, whose structure and stability are determined by the L\'evy index of the fractional GVD, the inter-core coupling strength, and the total energy, which determines the system's nonlinearity. Bifurcation diagrams (of the supercritical type) reveal regions where SSB occurs, identifying the respective symmetric and asymmetric ground-state soliton modes. In agreement with the general principle of the SSB theory, the solitons with broken inter-component symmetry prevail with the increase of the energy in the weakly-coupled system. Three-components vortex solitons (which do not feature SSB) are studied too. Because the fractional GVD breaks the system's Galilean invariance, we also address mobility of the vortex solitons, by applying a boost to them.</description>

      <title>Connections between kinks with different asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we show how to build bridges between field-theoretic models that have kink solutions with different asymptotic behavior. We study transformational properties of kinks in models with a real scalar field in two-dimensional space-time. We show how to obtain new models with solitons having different asymptotic behavior, using deformations with specific functions. In particular, starting from the well-known $\varphi^4$ model, we obtain kinks with super-exponential, super-super-exponential, power-law, and logarithmic asymptotics. We also comment on how asymptotic behavior of stability potential and zero mode can be obtained for deformed kinks.</description>
