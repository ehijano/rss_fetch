      <title>Rethinking Reliability Using Network Coding: a Practical 5G Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a real-time network coding system integrated into the IP layer of a 5G testbed, offering an alternative to conventional retransmission-based reliability mechanisms such as ARQ and HARQ. Using a netfilter-based packet interception framework, we inject forward erasure correction using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) into live traffic between a gNB and UE over a 3GPP RF link. We evaluate a block coding scheme, analyzing its impact on throughput, jitter, and resource usage. Results show that with appropriate code rate selection, RLNC can fully recover from packet losses using fewer transmissions than ARQ/HARQ and maintain a high throughput, particularly under moderate-to-high packet loss rates. These findings demonstrate that network coding can effectively replace retransmission-based reliability in future wireless systems, with the potential for more efficient resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Design of a Timer Queue Supporting Dynamic Update Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale timers are ubiquitous in network processing, including flow table entry expiration control in software defined network (SDN) switches, MAC address aging in Ethernet bridges, and retransmission timeout management in TCP/IP protocols. Conventional implementations suffer from critical limitations: low timing accuracy due to large-scale timer traversal and high computational overhead for new timer insertion. This paper presents a hybrid-architecture hardware priority queue based on systolic arrays and shift registers for efficient timer queue management. The design uniquely supports five operations: enqueue, dequeue, delete, update, and peek.To the best of our knowledge, it is the first hardware priority queue enabling in-queue priority updates. By leveraging centralized Boolean logic encoding within systolic blocks, the design efficiently generates set/shift control signals while the novel push-first operation ensures FIFO ordering for same-priority timers without additional metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the design operates at over 400 MHz on FPGAs, achieving a 2.2-2.8x reduction in resource consumption compared to state-of-the-art implementations.</description>

      <title>Near-realtime Earth Observation Via Starlink LEO Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are collecting vast amounts of data, which are invaluable for applications such as monitoring forest fires. However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated as "Starlink Space User" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites. SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization, that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure. We assess the performance of SSU using trace-driven simulations alongside real-world Starlink performance measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-aided design can significantly reduce the median backlog (data not delivered) per satellite.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Latency Analysis of the Data Distribution Service in ROS 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS) publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios, exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and performance in wireless industrial robotics.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Over LoRa Networks: Simulator Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over long-range (LoRa) low-power wide area networks faces unique challenges due to limited bandwidth, interference, and strict duty-cycle constraints. We develop a Python-based simulator that integrates and extends the Flower and LoRaSim frameworks to evaluate centralized FL over LoRa networks. The simulator employs a detailed link-level model for FL update transfer over LoRa channels, capturing LoRa's receiver sensitivity, interference characteristics, block-fading effects, and constraints on the maximum transmission unit. It supports update sparsification, quantization, compression, forward frame-erasure correction (FEC), and duty cycling. Numerical results illustrate the impact of transmission parameters (spreading factor, FEC rate) and interference on FL performance. Demonstrating the critical role of FEC in enabling FL over LoRa networks, we perform an in-depth evaluation of the impact of FEC on FL convergence and device airtime, providing insights for communication protocol design for FL over LoRa networks.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Energy Consumption and Latency of Over-the-Air Firmware Updates in LoRaWAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air firmware updates are crucial for mitigating security threats and maintaining up-to-date device functionality in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). LoRaWAN end devices are usually energy-constrained, and LoRaWAN transmissions are subject to duty-cycle restrictions. Consequently, controlling the energy expenditure and update-delivery latency of FUOTA are key challenges. We propose a flexible scheme that achieves a tunable trade-off between the energy consumption and delivery delay. The scheme employs the LoRa spreading factors sequentially to transmit update-carrying frames, sending a fixed number of frames with a given spreading factor before moving to the next. By adjusting the smallest spreading factor to be used and the number of transmissions per spreading factor, a suitable energy-delay trade-off can be achieved. Thus, time-sensitive updates, such as security patches, may be sent with a low-delay-high-energy setting, whereas a more energy-efficient but higher-delay setting may be used for non-critical updates.</description>

      <title>An Architecture for Distributed Digital Identities in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital identities are increasingly important for mediating not only digital but also physical service transactions. Managing such identities through centralized providers can cause both availability and privacy concerns: single points of failure and control are ideal targets for global attacks on technical, organizational, or legal fronts. We design, analyze, and build a distributed digital identity architecture for physical world transactions in common scenarios like unlocking doors, public transport, or crossing country borders. This architecture combines (biometric and other) sensors, (established and upcoming) identity authorities, attribute verifiers, and a new core component we call the \emph{Personal Identity Agent (PIA)} that represents individuals with their identity attributes in the digital domain. All transactions are conducted in a completely decentralized manner, and the components for which we currently assume central coordination are optional and only used for assisting with service discovery and latency reduction. We present a first protocol between these parties and formally verify that it achieves relevant security properties based on a realistic threat model including strong global adversaries. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates practical feasibility of both architecture and initial protocol for applications that can tolerate end-to-end latencies in the range of a few seconds.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical IDS for Zero-Day Attack Detection in Internet of Medical Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained, heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables), making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024 dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets, ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the meta-learning approach achieves high.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication with Distribution Learning through Sequential Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication. This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework, demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with adaptation capability.</description>

      <title>Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius for QKD Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests (maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack, and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover, we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR) for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and scalability.</description>

      <title>Hummingbird: Fast, Flexible, and Fair Inter-Domain Bandwidth Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09959v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To realize the long-standing vision of providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees on a public Internet, this paper introduces Hummingbird: a lightweight QoS-system that provides fine-grained inter-domain reservations for end hosts.
  Hummingbird enables flexible and composable reservations with end-to-end guarantees, and addresses an often overlooked, but crucial, aspect of bandwidth-reservation systems: incentivization of network providers. Hummingbird represents bandwidth reservations as tradable assets, allowing markets to emerge. These markets then ensure fair and efficient resource allocation and encourage deployment by remunerating providers. This incentivization is facilitated by decoupling reservations from network identities, which enables novel control-plane mechanisms and allows the design of a control plane based on smart contracts.
  Hummingbird also provides an efficient reservation data plane, which streamlines the processing on routers and thus simplifies the implementation, deployment, and traffic policing, while maintaining robust security properties. Our prototype implementation demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of Hummingbird's asset-based control plane, and our high-speed software implementation can fill a 160 Gbps link with Hummingbird packets on commodity hardware.</description>

      <title>Double reflections Assisted RIS Deployment and Energy-efficient Group Selection in mmWaves D2D Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a viable way to improve the performance of multi-hop device-to-device (D2D) communication. However, due to the substantial propagation and penetration losses of the millimeter waves (mmWaves), a direct line of sight (LoS) link and close proximity of a device pair are required for a high data rate. Static obstacles like trees and buildings can easily impede the direct LoS connectivity between a device pair. Hence, RIS placement plays a crucial role in establishing an indirect LoS link between them. Therefore, in this work, we propose a set cover-based RIS deployment strategy for both single and double RIS-assisted D2D communication. In particular, we have demonstrated that permitting reflections via two consecutive RISs can greatly lower the RIS density in the environment, preventing resource waste and enabling the service of more obstructed device pairs. After the RIS deployment, for information transfer, we also propose an energy-efficient group selection criteria. Moreover, we prove that sometimes double reflections are more beneficial than single reflection, which is counter-intuitive. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms a random and a recent deployment strategy.</description>

      <title>Generative Active Adaptation for Drifting and Imbalanced Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in network intrusion detection systems, yet its performance often degrades due to concept drift and imbalanced data. These challenges are compounded by the labor-intensive process of labeling network traffic, especially when dealing with evolving and rare attack types, which makes preparing the right data for adaptation difficult. To address these issues, we propose a generative active adaptation framework that minimizes labeling effort while enhancing model robustness. Our approach employs density-aware dataset prior selection to identify the most informative samples for annotation, and leverages deep generative models to conditionally synthesize diverse samples, thereby augmenting the training set and mitigating the effects of concept drift. We evaluate our end-to-end framework \NetGuard on both simulated IDS data and a real-world ISP dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in intrusion detection performance. Our method boosts the overall F1-score from 0.60 (without adaptation) to 0.86. Rare attacks such as Infiltration, Web Attack, and FTP-BruteForce, which originally achieved F1 scores of 0.001, 0.04, and 0.00, improve to 0.30, 0.50, and 0.71, respectively, with generative active adaptation in the CIC-IDS 2018 dataset. Our framework effectively enhances rare attack detection while reducing labeling costs, making it a scalable and practical solution for intrusion detection.</description>

      <title>FedABC: Attention-Based Client Selection for Federated Learning with Long-Term View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these challenges, we propose FedABC, an innovative client selection algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms, FedABC prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover, considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an optimization problem to guide FedABC throughout the training process. Following the "later-is-better" principle, FedABC adaptively adjusts the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that FedABC significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32% fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm FedAvg, and 3.5% higher accuracy with 2% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments, thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.</description>

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency, and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation mobile health applications.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Blockchain-enabled Parametric Insurance via Remote Sensing and IoT</title>

Abstract: Traditional Insurance, a popular approach of financial risk management, has suffered from the issues of high operational costs, opaqueness, inefficiency and a lack of trust. Recently, blockchain-enabled "parametric insurance" through authorized data sources (e.g., remote sensing and IoT) aims to overcome these issues by automating the underwriting and claim processes of insurance policies on a blockchain. However, the openness of blockchain platforms raises a concern of user privacy, as the private user data in insurance claims on a blockchain may be exposed to outsiders. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving parametric insurance framework based on succinct zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), whereby an insuree submits a zero-knowledge proof (without revealing any private data) for the validity of an insurance claim and the authenticity of its data sources to a blockchain for transparent verification. Moreover, we extend the recent zk-SNARKs to support robust privacy protection for multiple heterogeneous data sources and improve its efficiency to cut the incurred gas cost by 80%. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a working prototype of bushfire parametric insurance on real-world blockchain platform Ethereum, and present extensive empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandits for IoT with Dynamic Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.</description>

      <title>To Theoretically Understand Transformer-Based In-Context Learning for Optimizing CSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.</description>
