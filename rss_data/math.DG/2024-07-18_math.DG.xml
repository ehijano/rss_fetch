      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich. Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau, we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the ST-CMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic functions and bi-eigenfunctions on some model spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first give a convenient formula for bi-Laplacian on a sphere and the complete description of its eigenvalues, buckling eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenfunctions. We then show that the radial (or rotationally symmetric) solutions for biharmonic equation on the model space $( \mathbb{R}^+\times S^{m-1}, dr^2 + \sigma^2(r)\, g^{S^{m-1}})$ can be given by an integral formula. We also prove that the model space always admits proper biharmonic functions as the products of any eigenfunctions of the factor sphere with certain radial functions. Many explicit examples of proper biharmonic functions on space forms are given. Finally, we give a complete classification of proper biharmonic functions with positive Laplacian on the punctured Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain improved Strichartz estimates for solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvatures which are related to the classical universal results of Burq, G\'erard and Tzvetkov [11]. More explicitly, we are able refine the arguments in the recent work of Blair and the authors [3] to obtain no-loss $L^p_tL^{q}_{x}$-estimates on intervals of length $\log \lambda\cdot \lambda^{-1} $ for all {\em admissible} pairs $(p,q)$ when the initial data have frequencies comparable to $\lambda$, which, given the role of the Ehrenfest time, is the natural analog in this setting of the universal results in [11]. We achieve this log-gain over the universal estimates by applying the Keel-Tao theorem along with improved global kernel estimates for microlocalized operators which exploit the geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Simple matrix models for the flag, Grassmann, and Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive three families of orthogonally-equivariant matrix submanifold models for the Grassmann, flag, and Stiefel manifolds respectively. These families are exhaustive -- every orthogonally-equivariant submanifold model of the lowest dimension for any of these manifolds is necessarily a member of the respective family, with a small number of exceptions. They have several computationally desirable features. The orthogonal equivariance allows one to obtain, for various differential geometric objects and operations, closed-form analytic expressions that are readily computable with standard numerical linear algebra. The minimal dimension aspect translates directly to a speed advantage in computations. And having an exhaustive list of all possible matrix models permits one to identify the model with the lowest matrix condition number, which translates to an accuracy advantage in computations. As an interesting aside, we will see that the family of models for the Stiefel manifold is naturally parameterized by the Cartan manifold, i.e., the positive definite cone equipped with its natural Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for string algebroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

      <title>Interpolation by maximal and minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.03019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we use the inverse function theorem for Banach spaces to interpolate a given real analytic spacelike curve $a$ in Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$ to another real analytic spacelike curve $c$, which is ``close" enough to $a$ in a certain sense by constructing a maximal surface containing them. Next we apply the same method to interpolate two given real analytic curve $a$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$ and a real analytic curve $c$, which is also ``close" enough to ``a" in a certain sense with a minimal surface.
  Throughout this study, the Bj\"orling problem and Schwarz's solution to it play pivotal roles.</description>

      <title>Objective rates as covariant derivatives on the manifold of Riemannian metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subject of so-called objective derivatives in Continuum Mechanics has along history and has generated varying views concerning their true mathematical interpretation. Several attempts have been made to provide a mathematical definition that would at least partially unify the existing notions.  In this paper, we demonstrate that, under natural assumptions, all objective derivatives correspond to covariant derivatives on the infinite-dimensional manifold Met(B) of Riemannian metrics on the body. Furthermore, a natural Leibniz rule enables canonical extensions from covariant to contravariant tensor fields and vice versa. This makes the sometimes-used distinction between objective derivatives of ``Lie type'' and ``corotational type'' unnecessary. For an exhaustive list of objective derivatives found in the literature, we exhibit the corresponding covariant derivative on Met(B).</description>

      <title>Quantitative Maximal Diameter Rigidity of Positive Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Riemannian geometry, the Cheng's maximal diameter rigidity theorem says that if a complete $n$-manifold $M$ of Ricci curvature, $\operatorname{Ric}_M\ge (n-1)$, has the maximal diameter $\pi$, then $M$ is isometric to the unit sphere $S^n_1$. The main result in this paper is a quantitative maximal diameter rigidity: if $M$ satisfies that $\operatorname{Ric}_M\ge n-1$, $\operatorname{diam}(M)\approx \pi$, and the Riemannian universal cover of every metric ball in $M$ of a definite radius satisfies a Riefenberg condition, then $M$ is diffeomorphic and bi-H\"older close to $S^n_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quaternionic Calabi conjecture, posed by Alesker and Verbitsky \cite{Alesker-Verbitsky (2010)}, predicts that the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation can always be solved on any compact HKT manifold. Motivated by this conjecture, we will introduce a quaternionic version of the Gauduchon conjecture on any compact $SL(n,\mathbb{H})$-manifold, specifically addressing the existence of quaternionic Gauduchon metrics with prescribed volume form. We reframe this question as a special case of fully nonlinear elliptic equations of second order and subsequently establish a uniform estimate for the potential function.</description>

      <title>Upper Semicontinuity of Index Plus Nullity for Minimal and CMC Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of bubble converging minimal hypersurfaces, or H-CMC hypersurfaces, in compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary, of dimension 4, 5, 6 or 7, and prove upper semicontinuity of index plus nullity, for such a bubble converging sequence. This complements the previously known lower semicontinuity of index obtained by Buzano--Sharp, and Bourni--Sharp--Tinaglia.
  The strategy of our proof is to analyse a weighted eigenvalue problem along our sequence of hypersurfaces. This strategy is inspired by the recent work of Da Lio--Gianocca--Rivi\`{e}re. A key aspect of our proof is making use of a Lorentz--Sobolev inequality to study the behaviour of these weighted eigenfunctions on the neck regions along the sequence, as well as the index and nullity of our non-compact bubbles.</description>

      <title>A family of left-invariant SKT metrics on the exceptional Lie group $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $(M,J)$, an SKT (or pluriclosed) metric is a $J$-Hermitian metric $g$ whose fundamental form $\omega:=g(J\cdot,\cdot)$ satisfies the condition $\partial\overline{\partial}\omega=0$. As such, an SKT metric can be regarded as a natural generalization of a K\"{a}hler metric. In this paper, the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ is equipped with a left-invariant integrable almost complex structure $\mathcal{J}$ via the Samelson construction and a 7-parameter family of $\mathcal{J}$-Hermitian metrics is constructed. From this 7-parameter family, the members which are SKT are calculated. The result is a 3-parameter family of left-invariant SKT metrics on $G_2$. As a special case, the aforementioned family of SKT metrics contains all bi-invariant metrics on $G_2$. In addition, this 3-parameter family of left-invariant SKT metrics are also invariant under the right action of a certain maximal torus $T$ of $G_2$. Conversely, it is shown that if $g$ is a left-invariant $\mathcal{J}$-Hermitian metric on $G_2$ such that $g$ is invariant under the right action of $T$ and for which $(g,\mathcal{J})$ is SKT, then $g$ must belong to this 3-parameter family of left-invariant SKT metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A construction of integration, function calculus, and exterior calculus is made, allowing for integration of unital magma valued functions against (compactified) unital magma valued measures over arbitrary topological spaces. The Riemann integral, geometric product integral, and Lebesgue integral are shown as special cases. Notions similar to chain complexes are developed to allow this form of integration to define notions of exterior derivative for differential forms, and of derivatives of functions as well. Resulting conclusions on integration, orientation, dimension, and differentiation are discussed. Applications include calculus on fractals, stochastic analysis, discrete analysis, and other novel forms of calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of non-Archimedean metrics attached to a transcendental pseudoeffective cohomology class on a compact K\"ahler manifold. This is obtained via extending the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence to the relative case, and we point out that our construction agrees with that of Boucksom-Jonsson when the class is induced by a pseudoeffective $\mathbb Q$-line bundle.
  We introduce the notion of a flag configuration attached to a transcendental big class, recovering the notion of a test configuration in the ample case. We show that non-Archimedean finite energy metrics are approximable by flag configurations, and very general versions of the radial Ding energy are continuous, a novel result even in the ample case. As applications, we characterize the delta invariant as the Ding semistability threshold of flag configurations and filtrations and prove a YTD type existence theorem in terms of flag configurations.</description>

The first one is the orbifold version of the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for stable $\mathbb Q$-sheaves on threefolds while the second one has to do with the construction of canonical metrics on such spaces and their properties.</description>
