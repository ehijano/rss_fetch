      <title>Convective meta-thermal dispersion for self-adaptive cooling enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the heat transfer coefficient is crucial across various energy utilization processes for maintaining device safety and stability with high energy efficiency. However, in scenarios with limited heat capacity flow rates, increasing the thermal conductivity of encapsulated internal heat source (IHS) packaging can paradoxically impede heat transfer. Herein, we introduced a convective-meta thermal dispersion (CMTD) strategy applicable throughout the energy domain. By integrating low thermal conductivity materials into high thermal conductivity package structures, we disrupted tangential heat flow while preserving efficient radial heat transport. Through this approach, a notable reduction in tangential temperature within the fluid channel was achieved, effectively lowering the IHS temperature. Remarkably, this cooling mechanism does not need additional energy input, thermal property enhancements, or expanded heat transfer areas, which are often prerequisites in existing technologies. Moreover, spontaneous enhancement phenomena emerged under constrained heat transfer conditions, termed self-adaptive cooling enhancement. Our investigations revealed, under steady-state conditions, a maximum 24.5% decrease in IHS average temperature, while transient conditions exhibited a maximum 32.3% increase in heat transfer between the IHS and cooling fluid, validating the efficacy of the CMTD strategy. These findings offer a promising pathway for efficient thermal management in various thermal energy utilization fields with high power density such as nuclear fission and fusion and contributed to a deeper understanding of fundamental fluid-solid heat transfer mechanisms across the energy science.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Small-Angle Scattering Data in Core-Shell Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques, which utilize neutrons and X-rays, are employed in various scientific fields, including materials science, biochemistry, and polymer physics. During the analysis of SAS data, model parameters that contain information about the sample are estimated by fitting the observational data to a model of sample. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in analyzing SAS data using a sphere model. However, compared with the sphere model, the core-shell model, which represents functional nanoparticles, offers higher application potential and greater analytical value. Therefore, in this study, we propose an analytical method for the more complex and practical core-shell model based on Bayesian inference. Through numerical experiments, we evaluated the performance of this method under different conditions, including measurement times, number of data points, and differences in scattering length density. As a result, we clarify the conditions under which accurate estimations are possible.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Bound States in the Continuum and Exceptional Points in Coupled Helmholtz Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant states underlie a variety of metastructures that exhibit remarkable capabilities for effective control of acoustic waves at subwavelength scales. The development of metamaterials relies on the rigorous mode engineering providing the implementation of the desired properties. At the same time, the application of metamaterials is still limited as their building blocks are frequently characterized by complicated geometry and can't be tuned easily. In this work, we consider a simple system of coupled Helmholtz resonators and study their properties associated with the tuning of coupling strength and symmetry breaking. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum in the resonators placed in a free space and in a rectangular cavity. It is also shown that tuning the intrinsic losses via introducing porous inserts can lead to spectral splitting or merging of quasi-bound states in the continuum and occurrence of exceptional points. The obtained results will open new opportunities for the development of simple and easy-tunable metastructures based on Helmholtz resonances.</description>

      <title>A frequency-domain enhanced multi-view network for metal fatigue life prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue damages and failure widely exist in engineering structures. However, predicting fatigue life for various structural materials subjected to multiaxial loading paths remains a challenging problem. A novel multi-view deep learning model incorporating frequency-domain analysis for fatigue life prediction is proposed. The model consists of two main analytical components: one for analyzing multiaxial fatigue loading paths and the other for examining the mechanical properties of materials and specimen geometrical characteristics. In the module analyzing multiaxial fatigue loading paths, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and FNet are connected in parallel to extract features individually. Features of materials and specimens are extracted through fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). Subsequently, the features from these two parts are thoroughly integrated based on attention mechanisms, and connected to multiple FCNNs to accomplish fatigue life prediction. A fatigue experimental database comprising 557 samples, spanning 46 multiaxial loading paths and 19 metal materials, has been established for model training and testing. Additionally, 6 materials were respectively used as test sets to evaluate the extrapolation ability of the model. The results suggest that the proposed model exhibits robust predictive performance and extrapolation capabilities. We anticipate that the multi-view approach, along with its accuracy and applicability, can provide an unparalleled alternative for researchers in the field of engineering fatigue and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dual grating single-shot pump-probe technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of 95.4 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. The time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The measurements of the ultrafast two-photon absorption dynamics of ZnSe at a wavelength of 650 nm verify the effectiveness of this technique.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau simulations of three-terminal operation of a superconducting nanowire cryotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire cryotrons (nTrons) are expected to be used as interfaces for super-high-performance hybrid devices in which superconductor and semiconductor circuits are combined. However, nTrons are still under development, and diverse analyses of these devices are needed. Accordingly, we have developed a numerical technique to simulate the three-terminal operation of an nTron by using the finite element method to solve the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation and the heat-diffusion equation. Simulations using this technique offer understanding of the dynamics of the order parameter, the thermal behavior, and the characteristics of three-terminal operation, and the TDGL model reproduces qualitatively the results of nTron experiments. In addition, we investigated how some geometric and physical parameters (the design elements) affect the operation characteristics. The TDGL model has far fewer free parameters compared with the lumped-element electrothermal model commonly used for simulating superconducting devices. Furthermore, the TDGL model provides time-dependent visual information about the superconducting state and the normal state, thereby offering insights into the relationship between nTron geometry and three-terminal operation. These simulation results offer a route to nTron optimization and the development of nTron applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of critical currents of cross-type Josephson junctions with inhomogeneous critical current density under oblique magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the magnetic interference of sandwich-type Josephson junctions in which perpendicular or oblique magnetic fields are applied to the junction plane have received less attention than those where the applied magnetic fields are parallel. Recently, it has been theoretically demonstrated that a variety of magnetic interferences of the critical currents appear when oblique magnetic fields are applied to a cross-type junction with homogeneous critical current density. We theoretically investigated the effect of the inhomogeneous critical current density in the junction plane, and found that more complicated magnetic interferences appeared. We considered the distribution of the current density flowing through the junction plane to explore the cause of these complex magnetic interferences.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Integration of Freestanding Photonic Devices with Color Centers in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color center platforms have been at the forefront of quantum nanophotonics for applications in quantum networking, computing, and sensing. However, large-scale deployment of this technology has been stifled by a lack of ability to integrate photonic devices at scale while maintaining the properties of quantum emitters. We address this challenge in silicon carbide which has both commercially available wafer-scale substrates and is a host to color centers with desirable optical and spin properties. Using ion beam etching at an angle, we develop a 5-inch wafer process for the fabrication of triangular cross-section photonic devices in bulk 4H-SiC. The developed process has a variability in etch rate and etch angle of 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated color centers maintain their optical properties after the etch, thus achieving the nanofabrication goal of wafer-scale nanofabrication in quantum-grade silicon carbide.</description>

      <title>Dynamic FMR and magneto-optical response of hydrogenated FCC phase Fe25Pd75 thin films and micro patterned devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of H2 on the physical properties of Fe25Pd75. Broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy revealed a significant FMR peak shift induced by H2 absorption for the FCC phased Fe25Pd75. The peak shifted towards higher applied fields, which is contrary to what was previously observed for CoPd alloys. Additionally, we conducted structural and magneto-optical Kerr ellipsometric studies on the Fe25Pd75 film and performed density functional theory calculations to explore the electronic and magnetic properties in both hydrogenated and dehydrogenated states. In the final part of this study, we deposited a Fe25Pd75 layer on top of a microscopic coplanar transmission line and investigated the FMR response of the layer while driven by a microwave current in the coplanar line. We observed a large amplitude FMR response upon hydrogen absorption, as well as desorption rates when cycling between pure N2 and a mixture of 3% H2 + 97% N2.</description>

      <title>Effective medium properties of stealthy hyperuniform photonic structures using multiscale physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the effective permittivity and homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs are capable of capturing the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inverse retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

      <title>GeSn Defects and their Impact on Optoelectronic Properties: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GeSn has emerged as a promising semiconductor with optoelectronic functionality in the mid-infrared, with the potential of replacing expensive III-V technology for monolithic on-chip Si photonics. Multiple challenges to achieve optoelectronic-grade GeSn have been successfully solved in the last decade. We stand today on the brink of a potential revolution in which GeSn could be used in many optoelectronic applications such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDARs) devices and lasers. However, the limited understanding and control of material defects represents today a bottleneck in the performance of GeSn-based devices, hindering their commercialisation. Point and linear defects in GeSn have a strong impact on its electronic properties, namely unintentional doping concentration, carrier lifetime and mobility, which ultimately determine the performance of optoelectronic devices. In this review, after introducing the state-of-the-art of the fabrication and properties of GeSn, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of GeSn defects and their influence on the material (opto)electronic properties. Throughout the manuscript, we highlight the critical points that are still to solve. By bringing together the different fabrication techniques available and characterizations realized we provide a wholistic view on the field of GeSn and provide elements on how it could move forward.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Design Factors on Solar Module Thermomechanical Durability Using Interpretable Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar modules in utility-scale systems are expected to maintain decades of lifetime to rival conventional energy sources. However, cyclic thermomechanical loading often degrades their long-term performance, highlighting the importance of effective design to mitigate thermal expansion mismatches between module materials. Given the complex composition of solar modules, isolating the impact of individual components on overall durability remains a challenging task. In this work, we analyze a comprehensive data set that comprises bill-of-materials (BOM) and thermal cycling power loss from 251 distinct module designs to identify the predominant design factors and their impacts on the thermomechanical durability of modules. The methodology of our analysis combines machine learning modeling (random forest) and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to correlate design factors with power loss and interpret the model's decision-making. The interpretation reveals that silicon type (monocrystalline or polycrystalline), encapsulant thickness, busbar numbers, and wafer thickness predominantly influence the degradation. With lower power loss of around 0.6\% on average in the SHAP analysis, monocrystalline cells present better durability than polycrystalline cells. This finding is further substantiated by statistical testing on our raw data set. The SHAP analysis also demonstrates that while thicker encapsulants lead to reduced power loss, further increasing their thickness over around 0.6 to 0.7mm does not yield additional benefits, particularly for the front side one. In addition, other important BOM features such as the number of busbars are analyzed. This study provides a blueprint for utilizing explainable machine learning techniques in a complex material system and can potentially guide future research on optimizing the design of solar modules.</description>

      <title>Highly Reproducible and CMOS-compatible VO2-based Oscillators for Brain-inspired Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With remarkable electrical and optical switching properties induced at low power and near room temperature (68C), vanadium dioxide (VO2) has sparked rising interest in unconventional computing among the phase-change materials research community. The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer. Up to seven nearly identical VO2-based devices are contacted simultaneously to create a network of oscillators, paving the way for large-scale implementation of VO2 oscillating neural networks.</description>

      <title>A High Resolution Dilatometer Using Optical Fiber Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high performance differential dilatometer based on an all-fiber Michelson interferometer at cryogenic temperature with $10^{-10}$ resolution in $\delta L/L$. It resolve the linear thermal expansion coefficient by measuring the oscillating changes of sample thickness and sample temperature with the interferometer and in-situ thermometer, respectively. By measuring the linear thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ near the antiferromagnetic transition region of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ as a demonstration, we show our dilatometer is able to measure thin samples with sub-pm-level length change resolution and mK-level temperature resolution. Despite there is residual background thermal expansion of a few nm/K in measurement result, our new dilatometer is sitll a powerful tool for study of phase transition in condensed matter physics, especially significant advantages in fragile materials with sub-100$\mu$m thickness and being integrated with multiple synchronous measurements and tuning thanks to the extremely high resolution and contactless nature. The prototype design of this setup can be further improved in many aspects for specific applications.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectric fluorite oxides like hafnium (HfO2)-based materials are considered to be one of the most potential candidates for nowadays large-scale integrated-circuits (ICs). While zirconia (ZrO2)-based fluorites materials, which holds the same structure, is usually thought to be anti- or week ferroelectricity. We reported on an emergent giant ferroelectric remanent polarization (Pr) amounted to 53 {\mu}C/cm2 in orthorhombic ZrO2 growing on (110) SrTiO3 at room temperature. The robust ferroelectricity observed in ZrO2 is attributed to an irreversible orthorhombic anti-ferroelectric to a ferroelectric phase transition, facilitated by applying an electric field, particularly noticeable when the temperature is lowered to 77 K. This approach to reveal the intrinsic ferroelectricity in pure ZrO2 thin films, offers the new pathway to understand the origin ferroelectricity in fluorite oxides.</description>

      <title>Broadband microwave waveform generation with programmable chirp shapes via recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop controlled by low-speed electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadband microwave waveforms with programmable chirp shapes are captivating in numerous practical applications. Compared with electronic technology, photonic-assisted solutions exhibit excellent performance in bandwidth and flexibility, but still suffer from complex architecture and requirement of high-speed electronics. Besides, rapid manipulation of chirp shape is still a challenge in the scientific community. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel concept for generating broadband microwave waveforms with programmable chirp shapes. This concept is realized on a simple fiber-optic platform involving a continuous-wave laser source, a recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop, and low-speed electronics with a sampling rate at the level of MS/s. Based on this method, chirped microwave waveforms with a bandwidth up to tens of GHz can be generated, where the chirp shape is identical to the low-frequency driving waveform of the recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop. In addition, all the parameters of the generated chirped microwave waveforms can be easily reconfigured in real time, including the bandwidth, the central frequency, and the temporal duration. In the experiment, broadband microwave waveforms with customized chirp shapes are generated, where the center frequency and bandwidth tuning ranges exceed 21 GHz, the temporal duration is tuned in the range of 9 ns to 180 ns, and the coherent time of the generated microwave waveform is larger than 100 {\mu}s. This simple fiber-optic platform paves a way to generate broadband microwave waveforms with user-definable chirp shapes, which can find applications in broadband radar systems, electronic warfare and wireless communications.</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>
