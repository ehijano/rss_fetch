      <title>Supervised Link Prediction in Co-Authorship Networks Based on Author Node-Based Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the emergence of future research collaborations between authors in academic social networks (SNs) is a very effective example that demonstrates the link prediction problem. This problem refers to predicting the potential existence or absence of a link between a pair of nodes (authors) on the co-authorship network. Various similarity and aggregation metrics were proposed in the literature for predicting the potential link between two authors on such networks. However, the relevant research did not investigate the impact of similarity of research interests of two authors or the similarity of their affiliations on the performance of predicting the potential link between them. Additionally, the impact of the aggregation of the research performance indices of two authors on link prediction performance was not highlighted. To this end, in this paper we propose an integrative supervised learning framework for predicting potential collaboration in co-authorship network based on similarity of the research interests and the similarity of the affiliations of each pair of authors in this network. Moreover, our proposed framework integrates the aggregation of research performance indices of each author pair and the similarity between the two authors nodes with the research interest and affiliation similarity as four metrics for predicting the potential link between each two authors. Our experimental results obtained from applying our proposed link prediction approach to the two largest connected graphs of two huge academic co-authorship networks, namely ArnetMiner and DBLP, show the great performance of this approach in predicting potential links between two authors on large-scale academic SNs.</description>

      <title>Network classification through random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize networks using statistics from random walks, which can be particularly informative about network properties. We present the employed statistical metrics and compare their performance on multiple datasets with other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in many cases, often outperforming existing approaches, although some limitations are observed across certain datasets.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Narrative Divide: Cross-Platform Discourse Networks in Fragmented Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political discourse has grown increasingly fragmented across different social platforms, making it challenging to trace how narratives spread and evolve within such a fragmented information ecosystem. Reconstructing social graphs and information diffusion networks is challenging, and available strategies typically depend on platform-specific features and behavioral signals which are often incompatible across systems and increasingly restricted. To address these challenges, we present a platform-agnostic framework that allows to accurately and efficiently reconstruct the underlying social graph of users' cross-platform interactions, based on discovering latent narratives and users' participation therein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in key network-based tasks: information operation detection, ideological stance prediction, and cross-platform engagement prediction$\unicode{x2013}$$\unicode{x2013}$while requiring significantly less data than existing alternatives and capturing a broader set of users. When applied to cross-platform information dynamics between Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), our framework reveals a small, mixed-platform group of $\textit{bridge users}$, comprising just 0.33% of users and 2.14% of posts, who introduce nearly 70% of $\textit{migrating narratives}$ to the receiving platform. These findings offer a structural lens for anticipating how narratives traverse fragmented information ecosystems, with implications for cross-platform governance, content moderation, and policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Broad Spectrum Structure Discovery in Large-Scale Higher-Order Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are often driven by higher-order interactions among multiple units, naturally represented as hypergraphs. Understanding dependency structures within these hypergraphs is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems but is made challenging by their combinatorial complexity and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a class of probabilistic models that efficiently represents and discovers a broad spectrum of mesoscale structure in large-scale hypergraphs. The key insight enabling this approach is to treat classes of similar units as themselves nodes in a latent hypergraph. By modeling observed node interactions through latent interactions among classes using low-rank representations, our approach tractably captures rich structural patterns while ensuring model identifiability. This allows for direct interpretation of distinct node- and class-level structures. Empirically, our model improves link prediction over state-of-the-art methods and discovers interpretable structures in diverse real-world systems, including pharmacological and social networks, advancing the ability to incorporate large-scale higher-order data into the scientific process.</description>

      <title>Retweets, Receipts, and Resistance: Discourse, Sentiment, and Credibility in Public Health Crisis Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used Twitter to disseminate safety guidance and updates, reaching millions of users. This study analyzes two years of tweets from, to, and about the CDC using a mixed methods approach to examine discourse characteristics, credibility, and user engagement. We found that the CDCs communication remained largely one directional and did not foster reciprocal interaction, while discussions around COVID19 were deeply shaped by political and ideological polarization. Users frequently cited earlier CDC messages to critique new and sometimes contradictory guidance. Our findings highlight the role of sentiment, media richness, and source credibility in shaping the spread of public health messages. We propose design strategies to help the CDC tailor communications to diverse user groups and manage misinformation more effectively during high-stakes health crises.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach for Studying How Topological Measurements Respond to Complex Networks Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different types of graphs and complex networks have been characterized, analyzed, and modeled based on measurements of their respective topology. However, the available networks may constitute approximations of the original structure as a consequence of sampling incompleteness, noise, and/or error in the representation of that structure. Therefore, it becomes of particular interest to quantify how successive modifications may impact a set of adopted topological measurements, and how respectively undergone changes can be interrelated, which has been addressed in this paper by considering similarity networks and hierarchical clustering approaches. These studies are developed respectively to several topological measurements (accessibility, degree, hierarchical degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, assortativity, and average shortest path) calculated from complex networks of three main types (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, and geographical) with varying sizes or subjected to progressive edge removal or rewiring. The coincidence similarity index, which can implement particularly strict comparisons, is adopted for two main purposes: to quantify and visualize how the considered topological measurements respond to the considered network alterations and to represent hierarchically the relationships between the observed changes undergone by the considered topological measurements. Several results are reported and discussed, including the identification of three types of topological changes taking place as a consequence of the modifications. In addition, the changes observed for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks resulted mutually more similarly affected by topological changes than for the geometrical networks. The latter type of network has been identified to have more heterogeneous topological features than the other two types of networks.</description>

      <title>Improving flocking behaviors in street networks with vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve a flocking model on street networks introduced in a previous paper. We expand the field of vision of walkers, making the model more realistic. Under such conditions, we obtain groups of walkers whose gathering times and robustness to break ups are better than previous results. We explain such improvements because the alignment rule with vision guaranties walkers do not split into divergent directions at intersections anymore, and because the attraction rule with vision gathers distant groups. This paves the way to a better understanding of events where walkers have collective decentralized goals, like protests.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering for dependent community Hawkes process models of temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings including online social media communications, financial transactions, and international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node pairs.
  We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing network size and time duration.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation for Heterophilic Graphs Through the Lens of Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While uncertainty estimation for graphs recently gained traction, most methods rely on homophily and deteriorate in heterophilic settings. We address this by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic perspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to quantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph domains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with model depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors. Therefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each provide different information about the data distribution - different from homophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations simultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation on graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc density estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides state-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it matches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily through post-processing.</description>

      <title>The Stepwise Deception: Simulating the Evolution from True News to Fake News with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing spread of misinformation online, understanding how true news evolves into fake news has become crucial for early detection and prevention. However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.</description>

      <title>Community Detection in Networks: A Rough Sets and Consensus Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to propose a framework, called Rough Clustering-based Consensus Community Detection (RC-CCD), to effectively address the challenge of identifying community structures in complex networks from a set of different community partitions. The method uses a consensus approach based on Rough Set Theory (RST) to manage uncertainty and improve the reliability of community detection. The RC-CCD framework is tested on synthetic benchmark networks generated by the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) method, which simulate varying network scales, node degrees, and community sizes. Key findings demonstrate that RC-CCD outperforms established algorithms like Louvain, Greedy, and LPA in terms of normalized mutual information, showing superior accuracy and adaptability, particularly in networks with higher complexity, both in terms of size and dispersion. These results have significant implications for enhancing community detection in fields such as social and biological network analysis.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing evolving graph data presents substantial challenges in storage and privacy, and training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such data often leads to catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To this end, we propose Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL) to adapt GNNs across multiple evolving graphs under storage and privacy constraints. Our empirical study highlights two core challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where clients lose prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To address these, we introduce POWER, a framework that preserves experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage locally to mitigate LGF, and leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>GNNs-to-MLPs by Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are pivotal in graph-based learning, particularly excelling in node classification. However, their scalability is hindered by the need for multi-hop data during inference, limiting their application in latency-sensitive scenarios. Recent efforts to distill GNNs into multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for faster inference often underutilize the layer-level insights of GNNs. In this paper, we present TINED, a novel approach that distills GNNs to MLPs on a layer-by-layer basis using Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation techniques. We focus on two key operations in GNN layers: feature transformation (FT) and graph propagation (GP). We recognize that FT is computationally equivalent to a fully-connected (FC) layer in MLPs. Thus, we propose directly transferring teacher parameters from an FT in a GNN to an FC layer in the student MLP, enhanced by fine-tuning. In TINED, the FC layers in an MLP replicate the sequence of FTs and GPs in the GNN. We also establish a theoretical bound for GP approximation. Furthermore, we note that FT and GP operations in GNN layers often exhibit opposing smoothing effects: GP is aggressive, while FT is conservative. Using Dirichlet energy, we develop a DE ratio to measure these effects and propose Dirichlet Energy Distillation to convey these characteristics from GNN layers to MLP layers. Extensive experiments show that TINED outperforms GNNs and leading distillation methods across various settings and seven datasets.

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media platform that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. While the unsigned Men\'eame network effectively delineates ideological communities, only by incorporating negative ties can we identify ideologically extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors: without them, the most extreme users remain indistinguishable from their less confrontational ideological peers.</description>

Abstract: This study examines how public discourse around COVID-19 unfolded on Twitter through the lens of crisis communication and digital publics. Analyzing over 275,000 tweets involving the CDC, we identify 16 distinct discourse clusters shaped by framing, sentiment, credibility, and network dynamics. We find that CDC messaging became a flashpoint for affective and ideological polarization, with users aligning along competing frames of science vs. freedom, and public health vs. political overreach. Most clusters formed echo chambers, while a few enabled cross cutting dialogue. Publics emerged not only around ideology but also around topical and emotional stakes, reflecting shifting concerns across different stages of the pandemic. While marginalized communities raised consistent equity concerns, these narratives struggled to reshape broader discourse. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term, adaptive engagement with diverse publics and propose design interventions such as multi-agent AI assistants, to support more inclusive communication throughout extended public health crises.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Federation: Fair Governance of Large-Scale, Decentralized, Sovereign Digital Communities</title>

Abstract: Grassroots Federation aims to address the egalitarian formation and the fair democratic governance of large-scale, decentralized, sovereign digital communities, the size of the EU, the US, existing social networks, and even humanity at large. A grassroots federation evolves via the grassroots formation of digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital communities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations, relations, interests, causes, and more. Small communities (say up to $100$ members) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are governed by a similarly-small assembly elected by sortition among its members.
  Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition of the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation, populate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness conditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and on the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent community.
  In practice, we expect a grassroots democratic federation to grow and evolve dynamically and in all directions -- bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. To address that, we formally specify this dynamic setting and adapt the static fairness conditions to it: The ex post condition on the fair representation of a child community becomes a condition that must always hold; the ex ante conditions in expectation on the fair participation of an individual and on the fair representation of a child community become conditions satisfied in actuality in the limit, provided the federation structure eventually stabilizes. We then present a protocol that satisfies these fairness conditions.</description>
