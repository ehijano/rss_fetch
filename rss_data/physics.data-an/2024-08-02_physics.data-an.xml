      <title>Developing a Model-Consistent Reduced-Dimensionality training approach to quantify and reduce epistemic uncertainty in separated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proposed work introduces a data-assimilation-assisted approach to train neural networks, aimed at effectively reducing epistemic uncertainty in state estimates of separated flows. This method, referred to as model-consistent training, ensures that input features are derived directly from physics-based models, such as Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, to accurately represent the current state of the flow. Autoencoders have been selected for this task due to their capability to capture essential information from large datasets, making them particularly suitable for handling high-dimensional data with numerous discretization points in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This innovative approach integrates the ensemble Kalman method to enhance the training process, providing a robust framework for improving model accuracy and performance in turbulent flow predictions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Performance Measures for Qualifying Flood Models with Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses how to choose performance measures to compare numerical simulations of a flood event with one satellite image, e.g., in a model calibration or validation procedure. A series of criterion are proposed to evaluate the sensitivity of performance measures with respect to the flood extent, satellite characteristics (position, orientation), and measurements/processing errors (satellite raw values or extraction of the flood maps). Their relevance is discussed numerically in the case of one flooding event (on the Garonne River in France in February 2021), using a distribution of water depths simulated from a shallow-water model parameterized by an uncertain friction field. After identifying the performance measures respecting the most criteria, a correlation analysis is carried out to identify how various performance measures are similar. Then, a methodology is proposed to rank performance measures and select the most robust to observation errors. The methodology is shown useful at identifying four performance measures out of 28 in the study case. Note that the various top-ranked performance measures do not lead to the same calibration result as regards the friction field of the shallow-water model. The methodology can be applied to the comparison of any flood model with any flood event.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework. The code used has been made available for others to use.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Resolution Detector Simulation with Intra-Event Aware GAN and Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating high-resolution detector responses is a computationally intensive process that has long been challenging in Particle Physics. Despite the ability of generative models to streamline it, full ultra-high-granularity detector simulation still proves to be difficult as it contains correlated and fine-grained information. To overcome these limitations, we propose Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN). IEA-GAN presents a Relational Reasoning Module that approximates an event in detector simulation, generating contextualized high-resolution full detector responses with a proper relational inductive bias. IEA-GAN also introduces a Self-Supervised intra-event aware loss and Uniformity loss, significantly enhancing sample fidelity and diversity. We demonstrate IEA-GAN's application in generating sensor-dependent images for the ultra-high-granularity Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), with more than 7.5 M information channels at the Belle II Experiment. Applications of this work span from Foundation Models for high-granularity detector simulation, such as at the HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC), to simulation-based inference and fine-grained density estimation. To our knowledge, IEA-GAN is the first algorithm for faithful ultra-high-granularity full detector simulation with event-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of vortex pairing in transitional jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the onset of linear instabilities and their later nonlinear interactions in the shear layer of an initially-laminar jet using a combination of stability analysis and data from high-fidelity flow simulations. We provide a complete picture of the vortex-pairing process. Hydrodynamic instabilities initiate the transition to turbulence, causing the shear layer to spread rapidly. In this process, the shear layer rolls up to form vortices, accompanied by the exponential growth of the fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency grows, it gains energy from the mean flow. Subsequently, as it saturates and begins to decay, the fundamental vortices start to pair. During this vortex pairing process, the subharmonic vortex acquires energy both linearly from the mean flow and nonlinearly through a reverse cascade from the fundamental. The process concludes when the subharmonic vortex eventually saturates. Similarly, two subharmonic vortices merge to form a second subharmonic vortex. Our results confirm Kelly's (1967) hypothesis of a resonance mechanism between the fundamental and subharmonic, which supplies energy to the subharmonic. In this multi-tonal, convective-dominated flow, we clarify the ambiguity surrounding the fundamental frequency by demonstrating that the spatially most amplified frequency should be considered fundamental, rather than the structure associated with the spectral energy peak. For the initially-laminar jet considered here, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the fourth largest spectral peak, highlighting the important distinction between the energetically and dynamical significance of a tone. Despite its low energy, the fundamental frequency is dynamically dominant as it determines all other spectral peaks and supplies energy to the subharmonics through a reverse energy cascade.</description>
