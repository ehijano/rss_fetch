      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>

      <title>Foundry manufacturing of octave-spanning microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs provide a chip-based, octave-spanning source for self-referencing and optical metrology. We explore use of a silicon-nitride integrated photonics foundry to manufacture octave-spanning microcombs. By group-velocity dispersion engineering with the waveguide cross-section, we shape the soliton spectrum for dispersive-wave spectral enhancements at the frequencies for f-2f self-referencing. With the optimized waveguide geometry, we control the carrier-envelope offset frequency by adjusting the resonator radius. Moreover, we demonstrate the other considerations for octave microcombs, including models for soliton spectrum design, ultra-broadband resonator external coupling, low-loss edge couplers, and the nonlinear self-interactions of few-cycle solitons. This design process permits highly repeatable creation of soliton microcombs optimized for pump operation less than 100 mW, an electronically detectable offset frequency, and high comb mode power for f-2f detection. However, these design aspects must also be made compatible with the foundry fabrication tolerance of octave microcomb devices. Our experiments highlight the potential to manufacture a single-chip solution for an octave-spanning microcomb, which is the central component of a compact microsystem for optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity. I. Conventional case and unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we predict that periodic structures without gain and loss do not exhibit an S-shaped hysteresis curve in the presence of saturable nonlinearity (SNL). Instead, the input-output characteristics of the system admit ramp-like optical bistability (OB) and multistability (OM) curves that are unprecedented in the context of conventional periodic structures in the literature. An increase in the nonlinearity (NL) or the gain-loss parameter increases the switch-up and down intensities of different stable branches in a ramp-like OM curve. Revival of the typical S-shaped hysteresis curve requires the device to work under the combined influence of frequency detuning and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. An increase in the detuning, NL and gain-loss parameters reduces the switching intensities of the S-shaped OB (OM) curves. During the process, mixed OM curves that feature a fusion between ramp-like and S-shaped OM curves emanate at low values of the detuning parameter in the input-output characteristics. The detuning parameter values for which ramp-like, S-shaped, and mixed OM appear varies with the NL coefficient. For a given range of input intensities, the number of stable states admitted by the system increases with the device length or NL. When the laser light enters the device from the opposite end of the grating, nonreciprocal switching occurs at ultra-low intensities via an interplay between NL, detuning, and gain-loss parameters.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping and trapping of two-component gap solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Thouless pumping and arresting of gap solitons in a two-component Bose gas loaded into an optical superlattice. We show that, depending on the atomic interactions and chemical potentials, the two solitons can be simultaneously pumped or trapped, but we also identify regimes where one soliton is pumped and the other arrested. These behaviors can be understood by considering an effective model of the system based on a variational approach, which reveals that the soliton width is a suitable qualifier for the observed behaviours: solitons with a larger width get transported, while solitons with a smaller width get trapped. Since these width can be controlled by tuning interactions, it should be possible to observe all behaviours experimentally.</description>

      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity. II. Broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we observe that the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings (PTFBGs) with saturable nonlinearity (SNL) exhibit ramp-like, mixed, optical multistability (OM) in the broken regime. The interplay between nonlinearity and detuning parameter plays a central role in transforming the characteristics of the hysteresis curves and facilitates the realization of different OM curves. Also, it plays a crucial role in reducing the switch-up and down intensities of various stable branches of an OM curve. In a mixed OM curve, either the ramp-like hysteresis curves or S-like hysteresis curves can appear predominantly depending on the magnitude of the detuning parameter. An increase in the device length or nonlinearity increases the number of stable states for fixed values of input intensity. Under a reversal in the direction of light incidence, the ramp-like OM and mixed OM curves assume an unusual vortex-like envelope at lower intensities. Numerical simulations reveal that the switch-up and down intensities of different stable branches of a ramp-like OM and mixed OM curves drift towards the higher and lower intensity sides, respectively (opposite direction). The drift is severe to the extent that an intermediate hysteresis curve features switch-down action at near-zero switching intensities. Also, the input intensities required to realize ramp-like, and mixed OM curves reduce dramatically under a reversal in the direction of light incidence.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization of temporal solitons in Kerr cavities with pulsed injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical and analytical study was conducted to investigate the bifurcation mechanisms that cause desynchronization between the soliton repetition frequency and the frequency of external pulsed injection in a Kerr cavity described by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. The results suggest that desynchronization typically occurs through an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, a simple and intuitive criterion for this bifurcation to occur is proposed.</description>

      <title>Universal formal asymptotics for localized oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system of time-varying properties, embedded into a one-dimensional medium described by the telegraph equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quite general problem concerning a linear free oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system. This discrete sub-system is embedded into a one-dimensional continuum medium described by the linear telegraph equation. In a particular case, the discrete sub-system can move along the continuum one at a sub-critical speed. Provided that the dissipation in both discrete and continuum sub-systems is absent, if parameters of the sub-systems are constants, under certain conditions (the localization conditions), a non-vanishing oscillation localized near the discrete sub-system can be possible. In the paper we assume that the dissipation in the damper and the medium is small, and all discrete-continuum system parameters are slowly varying functions in time and in space (when applicable), such that the localization condition is fulfilled for the instantaneous values of the parameters in a certain neighbourhood of the discrete sub-system position. This general statement can describe a number of mechanical systems of various nature. We derive the expression for the leading-order term of a universal asymptotics, which describes a localized oscillation of the discrete sub-system. In the non-dissipative case, the leading-order term of the expansion for the amplitude is found in the form of an algebraic expression, which involves the instantaneous values of the system parameters. In the dissipative case, the leading-order term for the amplitude, generally, is found in quadratures in the form of a functional, which depends on the history of the system parameters, though in some exceptional cases the result can be obtained as a function of time and the instantaneous limiting values of the system parameters. Finally, we have justified the universal asymptotics by numerical calculations for some particular cases.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal pattern formation of conserved fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, nonreciprocally coupled systems have received growing attention. Previous work has shown that the interplay of nonreciprocal coupling and Goldstone modes can drive the emergence of temporal order such as traveling waves. We show that these phenomena are generically found in a broad class of pattern-forming systems, including mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems and viscoelastic active gels. All these systems share a characteristic dispersion relation that acquires a non-zero imaginary part at the edge of the band of unstable modes and exhibit a regime of propagating structures (traveling wave bands or droplets). We show that models for these systems can be mapped to a common "normal form" that can be seen as a spatially extended generalization of the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, providing a unifying dynamical-systems perspective. We show that the minimal nonreciprocal Cahn--Hilliard (NRCH) equations exhibit a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, including interrupted coarsening of traveling waves without selection of a preferred wavelength and transversal undulations of wave fronts in two dimensions. We show that the emergence of traveling waves and their speed are precisely predicted from the local dispersion relation at interfaces far away from the homogeneous steady state. Our work thus generalizes previously studied nonreciprocal phase transitions and shows that interfaces are the relevant collective excitations governing the rich dynamical patterns of conserved fields.</description>

      <title>Learning spatio-temporal patterns with Neural Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a powerful combination of machine learning and mechanistic modelling. We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series of images and PDE trajectories. Our method is designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling biological pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Compact Localized States in Electric Circuit Flatband Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generate compact localized states in an electrical diamond lattice, comprised of only capacitors and inductors, via local driving near its flatband frequency. We compare experimental results to numerical simulations and find very good agreement. We also examine the stub lattice, which features a flatband of a different class where neighboring compact localized states share lattice sites. We find that local driving, while exciting the lattice at that flatband frequency, is unable to isolate a single compact localized state due to their non-orthogonality. Finally, we introduce lattice nonlinearity and showcase the realization of nonlinear compact localized states in the diamond lattice. Our findings pave the way of applying flatband physics to complex electric circuit dynamics.</description>

      <title>The energy-frequency diagram of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two different methods are used to study the existence and stability of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon. The variational technique approximates it by a periodic function with a set of adiabatically changing parameters. An alternative approach treats oscillons as standing waves in a finite-size box; these are sought as solutions of a boundary-value problem on a two-dimensional domain. The numerical analysis reveals that the standing wave's energy-frequency diagram is fragmented into disjoint segments with $\omega_{n-1} &lt; \omega &lt; \omega_{n-2}$, where $\omega_n=\frac{2}{n+1}$. In the interval $(\omega_{n-1}, \omega_{n-2})$, the structure's small-amplitude wings are formed by the $n$-th harmonic radiation ($n=2,3, ...$). All standing waves are practically stable: perturbations may result in the deformation of the wave's radiation wings but do not affect its core. The variational approximation involving the first, zeroth and second harmonic components provides an accurate description of the oscillon with the frequency in $(\omega_1, \omega_0)$, but breaks down as $\omega$ falls out of that interval.</description>
