      <title>Phenome-Wide Multi-Omics Integration Uncovers Distinct Archetypes of Human Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.</description>

      <title>Same model, better performance: the impact of shuffling on DNA Language Models benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly popular in genomics due to their potential to decode complex biological sequences. Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Generative Framework for Modeling Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies and the simultaneous gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel hybrid quantum-classical simulator that leverages quantum entanglement to model single-cell transcriptomes. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) and cell-cell communication topologies with explicit directionality (causality). The synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies that challenge standard analysis. We demonstrated that classical correlation methods (Pearson and Spearman) failed to reconstruct the complete programmed quantum causal paths, instead reporting spurious statistical artifacts driven by high base-gene expression probabilities. Applying CellChat2.0 to the simulated cell-cell communication validated the true mechanistic links by showing a robust, relative increase in communication probability (up to 75-fold) only when the quantum entanglement was active. This work confirms that the quantum kernel is essential for creating high-fidelity ground truth data, highlighting the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>
