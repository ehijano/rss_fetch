      <title>Reflective Liquid-Crystal Phase Shifter based on Periodically Loaded Differential Microstrip Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance phase control units are crucial in beamforming technology, which has gained substantial attention for its ability to manipulate the wireless propagation environment, thereby enhancing capacity and coverage in communication networks. This paper presents the design and fabrication of a 3.5GHz reflective liquid-crystal (LC) phase shifter. The phase shifter is constructed using coplanar differential lines, periodically loaded with floating electrodes. The LCs in the overlapping areas act as variable capacitors, and the continuous phase shift can be adjusted by applying AC to the permittivity in these areas. Both simulation and measurement results demonstrate impressive Figures of Merit (FoM) of 101.3 degrees per dB and 85.7 degrees per dB, respectively. The grounding issues typically associated with coplanar waveguides (CPWs) on glass substrates are effectively mitigated by employing the virtual ground in a differential pair configuration. The innovative reflective-type operation minimizes the unit cell size and allows for low-cost manufacturing of phase shifter arrays and advances the practical development of beamforming technology.</description>

      <title>Harvesting magneto-acoustic waves using magnetic two-dimensional chromium telluride (CrTe3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vast majority of electrical devices have integrated magnetic units, which generate constant magnetic fields with noticeable vibrations. The majority of existing nanogenerators acquire energy through friction/mechanical forces and most of these instances overlook acoustic vibrations and magnetic fields. Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) tellurides present a wide range of possibilities for devising a potential flexible energy harvester. We have synthesized two-dimensional chromium telluride (2D CrTe3) which exhibits ferromagnetic (FM) nature with a Tc of 224 K. The structure exhibits stable high remnant magnetization, making 2D CrTe3 flakes a potential material for harvesting of magneto-acoustic waves at room temperature. A magneto-acoustic nanogenerator (MANG) was fabricated composing of 2D CrTe3 dispersed in a polymer matrix. Basic mechanical stability and sensitivity of the device with change in load conditions were tested. A high surface charge density of 2.919 mC m-2 was obtained for the device. The thermal strain created in the lattice structure was examined using in-situ Raman spectroscopic measurements. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) responsible for long-range FM ordering was calculated with the help of theoretical modelling. The theoretical calculations also showed opening of electronic bandgap which enhances the flexoelectric effects. The MANG can be a potential energy harvester to synergistically tap into the magneto-acoustic vibrations generated from the frequency changes of a vibrating device such as loudspeakers.</description>

      <title>How do longitudinal waves propagate transversely?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern, high-fidelity numerical simulations have shown an apparently anomalous result: a longitudinal elastodynamic wave travelling perpendicular to the forcing direction. Numerical simulations, in combination with an analytical model, are used to confirm that this is not simply a simulation artefact, but a true physical phenomenon, as well as illustrating that the behaviour also occurs for shear and guided waves. When assessing how this unexpected wave interacts with objects, however, it is found that it does not scatter, despite being clearly measurable. This paper has uncovered and explained this behaviour, which is critical for the reliable use of numerical wave simulations in elastic media, as well as potentially for high sensitivity experiments and other polarised wave modalities.</description>

      <title>Broadband Fourier-Transform Optical Photothermal Infrared Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical photothermal microscopy is a powerful, emerging method that overcomes the diffraction limit in infrared hyperspectral imaging by utilizing a visible probe laser beam to detect local temperature-induced modulation at the visible diffraction limit. However, the spectral range of this technique has been limited by the tuning range of infrared sources, which is generally restricted to the fingerprint window with commercially available quantum cascade lasers. In this work, ultra-broadband synchrotron infrared radiation was used for infrared photothermal imaging and spectroscopy, spanning the entire mid-infrared range. Both optical- and fluorescence-detected photothermal modalities were performed, demonstrating improved spectral range when compared to optical photothermal microscopy using commercial sources and improved spatial resolution when compared to synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements. Following these initial validation studies, synchrotron Fourier-transform optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (FT-OPTIR) in combination with synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements were used to differentiate cells in mouse brain tissue sections.</description>

      <title>Phase-field simulations opening new horizons in corrosion research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work overviews a new, recent success of phase-field modelling: its application to predicting the evolution of the corrosion front and the associated structural integrity challenges. Despite its important implications for society, predicting corrosion damage has been an elusive goal for scientists and engineers. The application of phase-field modelling to corrosion not only enables tracking the electrolyte-metal interface but also provides an avenue to explicitly simulate the underlying mesoscale physical processes. This lays the grounds for developing the first generation of mechanistic corrosion models, which can capture key phenomena such as film rupture and repassivation, the transition from activation- to diffusion-controlled corrosion, interactions with mechanical fields, microstructural and electrochemical effects, intergranular corrosion, material biodegradation, and the interplay with other environmentally-assisted damage phenomena such as hydrogen embrittlement.</description>

      <title>On acoustic space-time media that compute their own inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive time reflection and transmission coefficients for 1D acoustic waves encountering a time boundary at which the properties of the medium change instantaneously. The time reflection and transmission coefficients are shown to be identical to so-called reverse-space reflection and transmission coefficients which appear in the recursive computation of focusing wavefields used in seismology. We establish a bijectivity between the focusing wavefields and the wavefields produced by time scattering and show how this can be used to construct a space-time medium where the time scattering anticipates the space scattering and "computes" the exact inverse for the space scattering. The construction is shown to be independent of the boundary conditions chosen to compute the reflection and transmission coefficients. We demonstrate the construction with a simple numerical example of a single pulse encountering a series of time boundaries before reaching a spatial inhomogeneity. The time boundaries scatter the single pulse into a focusing wavefield that subsequently focuses through the spatial inhomogeneity. Under certain conditions, the transmitted wave has both the same wave shape and amplitude as the original pulse, yielding a transmission coefficient of unity. The reflection coefficient of the space-time medium is always non-zero however.</description>

      <title>A Nanocryotron Ripple Counter Integrated with a Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector for Megapixel Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decreasing the number of cables that bring heat into the cryostat is a critical issue for all cryoelectronic devices. Especially, arrays of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) could require more than $10^6$ readout lines. Performing signal processing operations at low temperatures could be a solution. Nanocryotrons, superconducting nanowire three-terminal devices, are good candidates for integrating sensing and electronics on the same technological platform as SNSPDs in photon-counting applications. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to read out, process, encode, and store the output of SNSPDs using exclusively superconducting nanowires. In particular, we present the design and development of a nanocryotron ripple counter that detects input voltage spikes and converts the number of pulses to an $N$-digit value. The counting base can be tuned from 2 to higher values, enabling higher maximum counts without enlarging the circuit. As a proof-of-principle, we first experimentally demonstrated the building block of the counter, an integer-$N$ frequency divider with $N$ ranging from 2 to 5. Then, we demonstrated photon-counting operations at 405 nm and 1550 nm by coupling an SNSPD with a 2-digit nanocryotron counter partially integrated on-chip. The 2-digit counter could operate in either base 2 or base 3 with a bit error rate lower than $2 \times 10^{-4}$ and a count rate of $10^7\,$s$^{-1}$. We simulated circuit architectures for integrated readout of the counter state, and we evaluated the capabilities of reading out an SNSPD megapixel array that would collect up to $10^{12}$ counts per second. The results of this work, combined with our recent publications on a nanocryotron shift register and logic gates, pave the way for the development of nanocryotron processors, from which multiple superconducting platforms may benefit.</description>

      <title>Direct-bonded diamond membranes for heterogeneous quantum and electronic technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond has superlative material properties for a broad range of quantum and electronic technologies. However, heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal diamond remains limited, impeding integration and evolution of diamond-based technologies. Here, we directly bond single-crystal diamond membranes to a wide variety of materials including silicon, fused silica, sapphire, thermal oxide, and lithium niobate. Our bonding process combines customized membrane synthesis, transfer, and dry surface functionalization, allowing for minimal contamination while providing pathways for near unity yield and scalability. We generate bonded crystalline membranes with thickness as low as 10 nm, sub-nm interfacial regions, and nanometer-scale thickness variability over 200 by 200 $\mu m^2$ areas. We measure spin coherence times $T_2$ for nitrogen-vacancy centers in bonded membranes of up to 623(21) $\mu$s, suitable for advanced quantum applications. We demonstrate multiple methods for integrating high quality factor nanophotonic cavities with the diamond heterostructures, highlighting the platform versatility in quantum photonic applications. Furthermore, we show that our ultra-thin diamond membranes are compatible with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which enables interfacing coherent diamond quantum sensors with living cells while rejecting unwanted background luminescence. The processes demonstrated herein provide a full toolkit to synthesize heterogeneous diamond-based hybrid systems for quantum and electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Acoustic and Electromagnetic Co-Modeling of Piezoelectric Devices at Millimeter Wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports the procedure for modeling piezoelectric acoustic resonators and filters at millimeter wave (mmWave). Different from conventional methods for lower frequency piezoelectric devices, we include both acoustic and electromagnetic (EM) effects, e.g., self-inductance, in both the circuit-level fitting and finite element analysis, toward higher accuracy at higher frequencies. To validate the method, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode devices are used as the testbed, achieving great agreement for both the standalone resonators and a fifth-order ladder filter. Upon further development, the reported acoustic and EM co-modeling could guide the future design of compact piezoelectric devices at mmWave and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting thin-film electronics are attractive for their low power consumption, fast operating speeds, and ease of interface with cryogenic systems such as single-photon detector arrays, and quantum computing devices. However, the lack of a reliable superconducting two-terminal asymmetric device, analogous to a semiconducting diode, limits the development of power-handling circuits, fundamental for scaling up these technologies. Existing efforts to date have been limited to single-diode proofs of principle and lacked integration of multiple controllable and reproducible devices to form complex circuits. Here, we demonstrate a robust superconducting diode with tunable polarity using the asymmetric Bean-Livingston surface barrier in niobium nitride micro-bridges, achieving a 43% rectification efficiency. We then realize and integrate several such diodes into a bridge rectifier circuit on a single microchip that performs continuous full-wave rectification up to 3 MHz and AC-to-DC conversion in burst mode at 50 MHz with an estimated peak power efficiency of 60%.</description>

Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>
