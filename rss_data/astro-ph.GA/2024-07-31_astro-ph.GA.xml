      <title>Silencing the Giant: Evidence of AGN Feedback and Quenching in a Little Red Dot at z = 4.13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at $z\gtrsim 4$. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous ($M_{\rm B}\sim-22.2$ mag) and compact ($&lt;500$ pc) source at $z=4.13$. The rest-optical ($\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 4000$ A) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$_{10}$[$M_*/M_\odot] \sim 10.6$), quenched (log$_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{-1}$] $&lt; -11$) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star-formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM $\sim 2500$ km/s) H$\alpha$ emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in LRDs for the first time, via a detection of a strong Ly$\alpha$ emission and a broad MgII, doublet. The derived black hole mass of log$_{10}$($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \sim 7.3$ results in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\sim 0.04$ %, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-$z$ reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at $z=4-10$ to explore an evolutionary link between high-$z$ reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.</description>

      <title>Probing the Magnetised Gas Distribution in Galaxy Groups and the Cosmic Web with POSSUM Faraday Rotation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results from the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), analysing 22,817 Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) with median uncertainties of 1.2 rad m^-2 across 1,520 square degrees to study magnetised gas associated with 55 nearby galaxy groups (z less than 0.025) with halo masses between 10^12.5 and 10^14.0 M_sun. We identify two distinct gas phases: the Intragroup Medium (IGrM) within 0-2 splashback radii and the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) extending from 2 to 7 splashback radii. These phases enhance the standard deviation of residual (i.e., Galactic foreground RM-subtracted) RMs by 6.9 +/- 1.8 rad m^-2 and 4.2 +/- 1.2 rad m^-2, respectively. Estimated magnetic field strengths are several microGauss within the IGrM and 0.1-1 microGauss in the WHIM. We estimate the plasma beta in both phases and show that magnetic pressure might be more dynamically important than in the ICM of more massive clusters or sparse cosmic web filaments. Our findings indicate that "missing baryons" in the WHIM likely extend beyond the gravitational radii of group-mass halos to Mpc scales, consistent with large-scale, outflow-driven "magnetised bubbles" seen in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that RM grids are an effective method for detecting magnetised thermal gas at galaxy group interfaces and within the cosmic web. This approach complements X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect methods, and when combined with Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measures, data from the full POSSUM survey, comprising approximately a million RMs, will allow direct magnetic field measurements to further our understanding of baryon circulation in these environments and the magnetised universe.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ionizing Properties of Metal-Poor, Muv ~ -12 Star Complex in the first Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a faint (M_UV &gt; -12.2), low-metallicity (Z ~ 0.02 Zsun), ionizing source (dubbed T2c) with a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.146. T2c is part of a larger structure amplified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACSJ0416, and was observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Stacking the short-wavelength NIRCam data reveals no stellar continuum detection down to a magnitude limit of m_UV ~ 31.0 (3 sigma). However, prominent Hb, [OIII]4959,5007, and Ha emissions are detected, with equivalent widths exceeding 200A, 800A, and 1300A (3 sigma), respectively. The corresponding intrinsic (magnification-corrected x23 +/- 3) ultraviolet and optical rest-frame magnitudes exceed 34.4 and 33.9 (corresponding to M_uv and M_opt fainter than -12.2 and -12.8, at lambda_rest ~ 2000A and ~5000A, respectively), suggesting a stellar mass lower than a few 10^4 Msun under an instantaneous burst scenario. The inferred ionizing photon production efficiency (xi_ion) is high, xi_ion &gt;~ 26.08(25.86) 3(5)sigma, assuming no dust attenuation and no Lyman continuum leakage, indicating the presence of massive stars despite the low mass of the object. The very poor sampling of the initial mass function at such low mass star-forming complex suggests that the formation of very massive stars might be favored in very low metallicity environments. T2c is surrounded by Balmer and weak oxygen emission on a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs after correcting for lensing effects. This system resembles an HII region potentially powered by currently undetected, extremely efficient, low-metallicity star complexes or clusters. We propose that massive O-type stars populate this low-mass and metallicity high-redshift satellites, likely caught in an early and short formation phase, contributing to the ionization of the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a z=6 Lyman-{\alpha} emitter down to parsec scales: extreme UV slopes, metal-poor regions and possibly leaking star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam analysis of a gravitationally-lensed galaxy ($\rm \mu=17-21$) at redshift 6.14 magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. The target galaxy is overall a typical compact and UV-faint ($\rm M_{UV}=-17.8$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter; yet, the large magnification allows the detailed characterisation of structures on sub-galactic (down to few parsec) scales. Prominent optical $\rm H\alpha$, $\rm H\beta$ and [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines are spatially resolved with the high spectral resolution grating (G395H, R~2700), with large equivalent widths, EW($\rm H\beta$+[OIII])$\gtrsim1000$ \AA, and elevated ionising photon production efficiencies $\rm log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz)=25.2-25.7$. NIRCam deep imaging reveals the presence of compact rest-UV bright regions along with individual star clusters of sizes $\rm R_{eff}=3-8~pc$ and masses $\rm M\sim2\cdot10^5-5\cdot10^{6}~M_\odot$ These clusters are characterised by steep UV slopes, $\rm\beta_{UV}\lesssim-2.5$, in some cases associated with a dearth of line emission, indicating possible leaking of the ionising radiation, as also supported by a Lyman-$\rm \alpha$ emission peaking at $\rm \sim100~km~s^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift. While the entire system is characterised by low-metallicity, $\sim0.1~Z_\odot$, the NIRSpec-IFU map also reveals the presence of a low-luminosity, metal-poor region with $\rm Z\lesssim2\%~Z_\odot$, barely detected in NIRCam imaging; this region is displaced by $\rm &gt;200~pc$ from one of the UV brightest structures of the system, and it would have been too faint to detect if not for the large magnification of the system.</description>

      <title>Are isolated compact galaxy groups special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Environments around quasars at $z\sim$3 revealed by wide-field imaging with Subaru HSC and CFHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the local density environments around 67 quasars at $z\sim3$, by combining the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Large Area U-band Survey (CLAUDS) over about 20 deg$^{2}$. Our measurements exploit $U$-dropout galaxies in the vicinities of quasars taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the quasars have the indistinguishable surrounding density distribution from the $U$-dropout galaxies, and that three quasars are associated with protocluster candidates within a projected separation of 3 arcmin. According to a halo evolutionary model, our results suggest that quasars at this epoch occupy haloes with a typical mass of $1.3^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \times 10^{13} h^{-1} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We also investigate the dependence of the local galaxy overdensity on ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, black hole (BH) masses, and proximity zone sizes of the quasars, but no statistically-significant correlation was found. Finally, we find that the local density of faint $U$-dropout galaxies are lower than that of bright $U$-dropout galaxies within a projected distance of $0.51\pm0.05$ physical Mpc, where the quasar UV radiation is 30 times intenser than backgroung UV radiation. We argue that photoevaporation may suppress galaxy formation at short distances where the quasar UV intensity is strong, even in massive haloes.</description>

      <title>Galaxies and Their Environment at $z \gtrsim 10$ -- I: Primordial Chemical Enrichment, Accretion, Cooling, and Virialization of Gas in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations made using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a number of high-redshift galaxies that are unexpectedly luminous. In light of this, it is clear that a more detailed understanding of the high redshift, pre-reionization universe is required for us to obtain the complete story of galaxy formation. This study is the first in a series that seeks to tell the story of galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 10$ using a suite of large-scale adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations. Our machine-learning-accelerated surrogate model for Population III star formation and feedback, StarNet, gives us an unprecedented ability to obtain physically accurate, inhomogeneous chemical initial conditions for a statistically significant number of galaxies. We find that of the 12,423 halos in the mass range of $10^6\,\,M_\odot &lt; M_\mathrm{vir} &lt; 10^9\,\, M_\odot$ that form in our fiducial simulation, $16\%$ are chemically enriched by Population III supernovae by $z\sim12$. We then profile and compare various cooling processes at the centers of halos, and find a complete absence of atomic cooling halos. All of our halos with central cooling gas are dominated by H$_2$ cooling, metal cooling, or a mixture of the two, even in the presence of a strong H$_2$-photodissociating Lyman-Werner background. We also find that gas accretion through the virial radius is not driven by cooling. We find that gas virialization in halos with $M_\mathrm{vir}\gtrsim10^7\,\,M_\odot$ is supported by bulk turbulent flows, and that thermal energy accounts for only a small fraction of the total kinetic energy. Because of this, the mean gas temperature is well below the virial temperature for these halos. We then compute the mass of gas that is available for Population II star formation, and infer star formation rates for each potential star-forming halo.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Stellar Tidal Streams in the Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar tidal streams are a key tracer of galaxy evolution and have the potential to provide an indirect means for tracing dark matter. For the Local Group, many diffuse substructures have been identified and their link to galaxy evolution has been traced. However, an analysis of a larger sample is required to better probe the frequency and characteristics of these streams to verify the predictions of the Lambda-CDM model and its implementation in cosmological simulations. For that purpose, we are carrying out the first systematic survey of faint stellar debris from tidally disrupted dwarf satellites around nearby galaxies up to a distance of 100 Mpc. In this paper, we present a catalogue with the results of the first harvest of stellar tidal streams found by visual inspection in deep images of ~ 700 galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We include a photometric characterisation of the streams obtained by measuring their surface brightnesses and colours. We found a total of 63 streams in our sample at distances between 40 and 100 Mpc, including 59 which were not previously reported. We measured their average surface brightness for the grz bands, to be 28.35+/-0.20, 27.81+/-0.13 and 27.62+/-0.09 mag arcsec^-2, respectively. By applying a statistical analysis to our findings, we obtained a stream detection frequency of 9.1% +/- 1.1% , in agreement with previous studies. We identified stream progenitors in 5-14% of our stream sample, depending on the confidence level. The first catalogue of streams in the Local Universe presented here will be complemented by future stream surveys within the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey. In this work we have learnt that the faintest measured stream surface brightness can be significantly brighter than the surface brightness limit of an image measured at pixel level, mainly due to correlated noise present in the images.</description>

      <title>Polarization Substructure in the Spiral-Dominated HH 111 Disk: Evidence for Grain Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HH 111 protostellar disk has recently been found to host a pair of spiral arms. Here we report the dust polarization results in the disk as well as the inner envelope around it, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in continuum at lambda ~ 870 micron and ~ 0. 05" resolution. In the inner envelope, polarization is detected with a polarization degree of ~ 6% and an orientation almost everywhere parallel to the minor axis of the disk, and thus likely to be due to the dust grains magnetically aligned mainly by toroidal fields. In the disk, the polarization orientation is roughly azimuthal on the far side and becomes parallel to the minor axis on the near side, with a polarization gap in between on the far side near the central protostar. The disk polarization degree is ~ 2%. The polarized intensity is higher on the near side than the far side, showing a near-far side asymmetry. More importantly, the polarized intensity and thus polarization degree are lower in the spiral arms, but higher in between the arms, showing an anticorrelation of the polarized intensity with the spiral arms. Our modeling results indicate that this anticorrelation is useful for constraining the polarization mechanism and is consistent with the dust self-scattering by the grains that have grown to a size of ~ 150 micron. The interarms are sandwiched and illuminated by two brighter spiral arms and thus have higher polarized intensity. Our dust self-scattering model can also reproduce the observed polarization orientation parallel to the minor axis on the near side and the observed azimuthal polarization orientation at the two disk edges in the major axis.</description>

      <title>A normal broad line AGN SDSS J1617+0638 as the host galaxy of a central tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, strong clues are reported to support the normal broad line AGN SDSS J1617+0638 as the host galaxy harboring a central tidal disruption event (TDE). Through the optical flare in the CSS 8.5years-long light curve and the none-variability in the up-to-date ASAS-SN light curves, the theoretical TDE model described by the MOSFIT code can be applied in SDSS J1617+0638. Meanwhile, considering the assumed central TDE expected continuum emissions not strong enough to describe the continuum emissions in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1617+0638, an additional power law component from pre-existing AGN activity should be necessary in SDSS J1617+0638. Furthermore, considering the short time duration to the observed date for the SDSS spectrum from the starting time of the assumed central TDE in SDSS J1617+0638, TDE model expected accreting mass only about 0.03$M_\odot$ can lead to few effects of TDEs debris on the observed broad emission lines in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1617+0638, indicating the TDE model determined BH mass simply consistent with the virial BH mass by broad emission lines, as determined results in SDSS J1617+0638. Therefore, through both the photometric variability and the spectroscopic results, a central TDE can be preferred in the normal broad line AGN SDSS J1617+0638 with pre-existing central AGN activity and pre-existing broad emission line regions.</description>

      <title>Transferability of Photometric Redshifts Determined using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the random forest algorithm GALPRO is implemented to generate photometric redshift posteriors, and its performance when trained and then applied to data from another survey is investigated. The algorithm is initially calibrated using a truth dataset compiled from the DESI Legacy survey. We find that the testing and training datasets must have very similar redshift distributions, with the range of their photometric data overlapping by at least 90% in the appropriate photometric bands in order for the training data to be applicable to the testing data. Then GALPRO is again trained using the DESI dataset and then applied to a sample drawn from the PanSTARRS survey, to explore whether GALPRO can be first trained using a trusted dataset and then applied to an entirely new survey, albeit one that uses a different magnitude system for its photometric bands, thus requiring careful conversion of the measured magnitudes for the new survey before GALPRO can be applied. The results of this further test indicate that GALPRO does not produce accurate photometric redshift posteriors for the new survey, even where the distribution of redshifts for the two datasets overlaps by over 90%. Hence, we conclude that the photometric redshifts generated by GALPRO are not suitable for generating estimates of photometric redshifts and their posterior distribution functions when applied to an entirely new survey, particularly one that uses a different magnitude system. However, our results demonstrate that GALPRO is a useful tool for inferring photometric redshift estimates in the case where a spectroscopic galaxy survey is nearly complete, but is missing some spectroscopic redshift values.</description>

      <title>The Fourth S-PLUS Data Release: 12-filter photometry covering $\sim3000$ square degrees in the southern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) is a project to map $\sim9300$ sq deg of the sky using twelve bands (seven narrow and five broadbands). Observations are performed with the T80-South telescope, a robotic telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile. The survey footprint consists of several large contiguous areas, including fields at high and low galactic latitudes, and towards the Magellanic Clouds. S-PLUS uses fixed exposure times to reach point source depths of about $21$ mag in the $griz$ and $20$ mag in the $u$ and the narrow filters. This paper describes the S-PLUS Data Release 4 (DR4), which includes calibrated images and derived catalogues for over 3000 sq deg, covering the aforementioned area. The catalogues provide multi-band photometry performed with the tools \texttt{DoPHOT} and \texttt{SExtractor} -- point spread function (\PSF) and aperture photometry, respectively. In addition to the characterization, we also present the scientific potential of the data. We use statistical tools to present and compare the photometry obtained through different methods. Overall we find good agreement between the different methods, with a slight systematic offset of 0.05\,mag between our \PSF and aperture photometry. We show that the astrometry accuracy is equivalent to that obtained in previous S-PLUS data releases, even in very crowded fields where photometric extraction is challenging. The depths of main survey (MS) photometry for a minimum signal-to-noise ratio $S/N = 3$ reach from $\sim19.5$ for the bluer bands to $\sim21.5$ mag on the red. The range of magnitudes over which accurate \PSF photometry is obtained is shallower, reaching $\sim19$ to $\sim20.5$ mag depending on the filter. Based on these photometric data, we provide star-galaxy-quasar classification and photometric redshift for millions of objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

      <title>Simulating Radio Synchrotron Morphology, Spectra, and Polarization of Cosmic Ray Driven Galactic Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies is significantly influenced by galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays due to their long cooling times and better coupling to plasma compared to radiation. In this study, we compare the radio observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 from the CHANG-ES collaboration catalog with a mock observation of an isolated galaxy based on the arepo simulation that adopts the state-of-the-art two-moment cosmic ray transport treatment and multiphase interstellar medium model. We find significant agreement between the simulated and observed images and spectroscopic data. Specifically, we find that (i) while the radio flux is sensitive to the magnitude of the magnetic field, the shapes of intensity profiles are only weakly dependent on the normalization of the magnetic field and are robustly predicted by our galaxy simulations; (ii) the multi-wavelength spectrum above 0.1~GHz is in agreement with the radio observations and its slope is also only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength; (iii) the magnetic field direction exhibits an X-shaped morphology, often seen in edge-on galaxies, which is consistent with the observations and indicates the presence of a galactic-scale outflow. Since the normalization of the intensity profiles and spectrum are degenerate with respect to the magnetic field strength and the normalization of the electron spectrum, this qualitative match is possible provided that the simulated magnetic field is only mildly boosted, which could be attributed to the missing galactic disk interaction with the CGM in our idealized simulation. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating advanced cosmic ray transport models in simulations and provide a deeper understanding of galactic wind dynamics and its impact on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The PARSEC view of star formation in galaxy centres: from protoclusters to star clusters in an early-type spiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding star formation in galaxies requires resolving the physical scale on which star formation often occurs: the scale of star clusters. We present a multiwavelength, eight-parsec resolution study of star formation in the circumnuclear star cluster and molecular gas rings of the early-type spiral NGC 1386. The cluster ring formed simultaneously ~ 4 Myr ago. The clusters have similar properties in terms of mass and star formation rate, resembling those of H II regions in the Milky Way disc. The molecular CO gas resolves into long filaments, which define a secondary ring detached from the cluster ring. Most clusters are in CO voids. Their separation with respect the CO filaments is reminiscent of that seen in galaxy spiral arms. By analogy, we propose that a density wave through the disc of this galaxy may have produced this gap in the central kpc. The CO filaments fragment into strings of dense, unresolved clouds with no evidence of a stellar counterpart. These clouds may be the sites of a future population of clusters in the ring. The free-fall time of these clouds, ~ 10 Myr, is close to the orbital time of the CO ring. This coincidence could lead to a synchronous bursting ring, as is the case for the current ring. The inward spiralling morphology of the CO filaments and co-spatiality with equivalent kpc-scale dust filaments are suggestive of their role as matter carriers from the galaxy outskirts to feed the molecular ring and a moderate active nucleus.</description>

      <title>Recent Update of Gas-Phase Chemical Reactions and Molecular Lines of TiO in Cloudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our current update on the gas-phase chemical reactions and spectral lines of TiO in the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. For this purpose, we have added 229 Ti-related reactions in the chemical network. In addition, we consider 230 fine-structure energy levels, the corresponding 223 radiative transitions, and 444 collisional transitions with ortho and para H$_2$ and predict 66 TiO lines. We perform spectroscopic simulations of TiO emission from the circumstellar region of the oxygen-rich red supergiant VY Canis Majoris to validate our update. Our model reproduces the observed TiO column density. This update is helpful in modeling dust-free astrophysical environments where Ti is in the gas phase and TiO can form.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Polarized Dust Emission from the First Flight of the SPIDER Balloon-Borne Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate that i) the spectral energy distribution of diffuse Galactic dust emission is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) its angular power spectrum is broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) there is no significant detection of line-of-sight decorrelation of the astrophysical polarization. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within a subset of the SPIDER region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. These modeling uncertainties have a small--but non-negligible--impact on limits on the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the \spider dataset. The fidelity of the component separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments may thus have a significant impact on their constraining power.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Portrait of the 3C 220.3 Lensed System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy ("galaxy A," $z_A = 0.6850$) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy ($z_{{\rm SMG1}} = 2.221$). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy ("galaxy B") is part of the lensing system with $z_B = 0.6835$. New three-color HST data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [OII] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [OII] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar-mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ~0.8, higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for a point X-ray source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ~3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ~3 below the equipartition fields, as typical for radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Observations of Extremely Metal-Poor O Stars: Weak Winds and Constraints for Evolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity ($Z_\odot$). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3-14% $Z_\odot$. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multi-wavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-$Z$ stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low $Z$ for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars' FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Extremely Soft Binaries in Dense Star Clusters: On the Jupiter Mass Binary Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming regions, characterized by dense environments, experience frequent encounters that significantly influence binary systems, leading to their hardening, softening, or ionization. We extend the Hut \&amp; Bahcall formalism to derive an analytical expression for the ionization cross-section in extreme mass ratio binary systems, allowing us to investigate the orbital evolution and population dynamics of binary planets and binary brown dwarfs in star clusters, while considering ongoing binary system formation. Our findings reveal that for low-mass soft binaries, the semi-major axis distribution asymptotes to a universal power law between $\propto a^{-8/3}$ and $\propto a^{-5/3}$ over the derived ionization timescale. We also discuss the implications of our results for the candidate Jupiter-mass binary objects putatively reported in the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate that if their existence is verified, they likely form continuously with a spectrum proportional to $a^{1}$, aligning better with the ejection mechanism than with the in-situ formation mechanism, which predicts a distribution roughly proportional to $a^{-1}$. However, this implies an impractically high ejection formation rate. Alternatively, if these objects are binary brown dwarfs, continuous in-situ formation ($\propto a^{-1}$) with an initial minimal semi-major axis around 20 AU and a formation rate of 100 Myr$^{-1}$ plausibly matches the observed number of single objects, binary number, binary fraction, and semi-major axis distribution.</description>

      <title>The effects of surface fossil magnetic fields on massive star evolution: V. Models at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At metallicities lower than that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, it remains essentially unexplored how fossil magnetic fields, forming large-scale magnetospheres, could affect the evolution of massive stars, thereby impacting the fundamental building blocks of the early Universe. We extend our stellar evolution model grid with representative calculations of main-sequence, single-star models with initial masses of 20 and 60 M$_\odot$, including appropriate changes for low-metallicity environments ($Z = 10^{-3}-10^{-6}$). We scrutinise the magnetic, rotational, and chemical properties of the models. When lowering the metallicity, the rotational velocities can become higher and the tendency towards quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution increases. While magnetic fields aim to prevent the development of this evolutionary channel, the weakening stellar winds lead to less efficient magnetic braking in our models. Since the stellar radius is almost constant during a blueward evolution caused by efficient chemical mixing, the surface magnetic field strength remains unchanged in some models. We find core masses at the terminal-age main sequence between 22 and 52 M$_\odot$ for initially 60 M$_\odot$ models. This large difference is due to the vastly different chemical and rotational evolution. We conclude that in order to explain chemical species and, in particular, high nitrogen abundances in the early Universe, the adopted stellar models need to be under scrutiny. The assumptions regarding wind physics, chemical mixing, and magnetic fields will strongly impact the model predictions.</description>

      <title>AGB and Post-AGB Stars versus Planetary Nebulae and Young Stellar Objects: Properties in Visual and IR Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of AGB and post-AGB (PAGB) stars, planetary nebulae, and young stellar objects (YSOs) in our Galaxy through an analysis of observational data covering visual and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Utilizing datasets from IRAS, 2MASS, AllWISE, Gaia DR3, and the SIMBAD object database, we perform an in-depth comparison between observational data and theoretical models. For this comparison, we present various color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in visual and IR bands, as well as IR two-color diagrams (2CDs). Our results demonstrate that the CMDs, incorporating the latest distance and extinction data from Gaia DR3 for a majority of sample stars, are effective in distinguishing different classes of stars. To improve the precision of our analysis, we apply theoretical radiative transfer models for dust shells around AGB and PAGB stars. A thorough comparison of the theoretical models with observations across various IR 2CDs and CMDs shows a significant agreement. We find that AGB and PAGB stars are among the brightest classes in visual and IR bands. Furthermore, most YSOs are clearly distinguishable from AGB stars on various IR CMDs, exhibiting fainter absolute magnitudes in IR bands.</description>

      <title>On the use of field RR Lyrae as Galactic probes VII. light curve templates in the LSST photometric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{Vera C. Rubin} Observatory will start operations in 2025. During the first two years, too few visits per target per band will be available, meaning that mean magnitude measurements of variable stars will not be precise and thus, standard candles like RR Lyrae (RRL) will not be usable. Light curve templates (LCTs) can be adopted to estimate the mean magnitude of a variable star with few magnitude measurements, provided that their period (plus amplitude and reference epoch, depending on how the LCT is applied) is known. LSST will provide precise RRL periods within the first six months, allowing to exploit RRLs if LCTs were available.
  We aim to build LCTs in the LSST bands to enhance the early science with LSST. Using them will provide a 1-2 years advantage with respect to a classical approach, concerning distance measurements.
  We collected $gri$-band data from the ZTF survey and $z$-band data from DECam to build the LCTs of RRLs. We also adopted synthetic $griz$-band data in the LSST system from pulsation models, plus SDSS, \gaia and OGLE photometry, inspecting the light amplitude ratios in different photometric systems to provide useful conversions to apply the LCTs.
  We have built LCTs of RRLs in the $griz$ bands of the LSST photometric system; for the $z$ band, we could build only fundamental-mode RRL LCTs. We quantitatively demonstrated that LCTs built with ZTF and DECam data can be adopted on the LSST photometric system. LCTs will decrease by a factor of at least two the uncertainty on distance estimates of RRLs, with respect to a simple average of the available measurements. Finally, within our tests, we have found a brand new behavior of amplitude ratios in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>What are the Pillars of Reionization? Revising the AGN Luminosity Function at z~5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, high-z AGNs were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidences in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and HST. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z&gt;4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z~5 AGNs (both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST), allowing to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450&lt;-26) of the z~5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450&gt;-22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant and the knee (M1450~-24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z=5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photo-ionization rate produced by z~5 AGNs is consistent with the UV background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z&gt;6, well into the epoch of reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be the major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVI: An asymmetric dust disk driving a multi-component molecular outflow in the young Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded disks observations of the Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3. Our observations included 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of 0.''05 (7.8 au) and several molecular species including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_{2}$CO and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$. The dust continuum analysis unveiled a disk-shaped structure with a major axis size of $\sim$200 au. We observed an asymmetry in the minor axis of the continuum emission suggesting that the emission is optically thick and the disk is flared. On the other hand, we identified two prominent bumps along the major axis located at distances of 26 and 50 au from the central protostar. The origin of the bumps remains uncertain and might be due to an embedded substructure within the disk or the result of the temperature distribution instead of surface density due to optically thick continuum emission. The $^{12}$CO emission reveals a molecular outflow consisting of three distinct components: a collimated one, an intermediate velocity component exhibiting an hourglass shape, and a wider angle low-velocity component. We associate these components with the coexistence of a jet and a disk-wind. The C$^{18}$O emission traces both a Keplerian rotating circumstellar disk and the infall of the rotating envelope. We measured a stellar dynamical mass of 0.35$\pm$0.09 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The Star-forming and Ionizing Properties of Dwarf z~6-9 Galaxies in JADES: Insights on Bursty Star Formation and Ionized Bubble Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reionization is thought to be driven by faint star-forming galaxies, but characterizing this population has long remained very challenging. Here we utilize deep nine-band NIRCam imaging from JADES to study the star-forming and ionizing properties of 756 $z\sim6-9$ galaxies, including hundreds of very UV-faint objects ($M_\mathrm{UV}&gt;-18$). The faintest ($m\sim30$) galaxies in our sample typically have stellar masses of $M_\ast\sim(1-3)\times10^7$ $M_\odot$ and young light-weighted ages ($\sim$50 Myr), though some show strong Balmer breaks implying much older ages ($\sim$500 Myr). We find no evidence for extremely massive galaxies ($&gt;3\times10^{10}$ $M_\odot$). We infer a strong (factor $&gt;$2) decline in the typical [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ EWs towards very faint $z\sim6-9$ galaxies, yet a weak UV luminosity dependence on the H$\alpha$ EWs at $z\sim6$. We demonstrate that these EW trends can be explained if fainter galaxies have systematically lower metallicities as well as more recently-declining star formation histories relative to the most UV-luminous galaxies in our sample. Our data provide evidence that the brightest galaxies are frequently experiencing a recent strong upturn in SFR. We also discuss how the EW trends may be influenced by a strong correlation between $M_\mathrm{UV}$ and Lyman continuum escape fraction. This alternative explanation has dramatically different implications for the contribution of galaxies along the luminosity function to cosmic reionization. Finally, we quantify the photometric overdensities around two $z&gt;7$ strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters. One Ly$\alpha$ emitter lies close to a strong photometric overdensity while the other shows no significant nearby overdensity, perhaps implying that not all strong $z&gt;7$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters reside in large ionized bubbles.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Forecasting the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing population for the China Space Station Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing (GGSL) is a powerful probe for the formation and evolution of galaxies and cosmology, while the sample size of GGSLs leads to considerable uncertainties and potential bias. The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, to be launched in late 2026) will conduct observations across 17,500 square degrees of the sky, capturing images in the $ugriz$ bands with a spatial resolution comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope. We ran a set of Monte Carlo simulations to predict that the CSST's wide-field survey will observe $\sim$160,000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses over its lifespan, increasing the number of existing galaxy-galaxy strong lens samples by three orders of magnitude. This is comparable to the capabilities of the $\it Euclid$ telescope but with the added benefit of additional color information. Specifically, the CSST can detect strong lenses with Einstein radii about $0.64\pm0.42^{"}$, corresponding to the velocity dispersions of $217.19 \pm 50.55 \, \text{km/s}$. These lenses exhibit a median magnification of $\sim$5. The apparent magnitude of the unlensed sources in the g-band is $25.87 \pm 1.19$. The signal-to-noise ratio of the lensed images covers a range of $\sim 20$ to $\sim 1000$, allowing us to determine the Einstein radius with an accuracy ranging from $\sim 1 \%$ to $\sim 0.1 \%$, ignoring various modeling systematics. Our estimates indicate that CSST can observe rare systems like double source-plane and spiral galaxy lenses. The above selection functions of the CSST strong lensing observation help optimize the strategy of finding and modeling GGSLs.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction in Kerr Black Holes through Frame-Dragging Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is argued that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere. The pivotal ZAMO-measured FLAV $\Omega_{\rm ZF} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$ changes sign on this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where the force-free and freezing-in conditions break down. The force-free magnetosphere is divided on this surface, with particle-current sources on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&lt;0$).
  Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, when $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is ensured by the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: The quasar UV and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions at $2.7&lt;z&lt;5.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF), in bins of redshift, of quasars selected in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). A sample of 915 objects was selected at $2.7&lt;z&lt;5.3$ within an effective area of $\sim 36$ deg$^2$ observed in 40 narrow-band filters (NB; FWHM $\sim 120$ \r{A}). We cover the intermediate-bright luminosity regime of the LF $(10^{43.5}&lt;(L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;10^{45.5}$; $-29&lt;M_{\rm UV}&lt;-24)$. The continuous wavelength coverage of the PAUS NB set allows a very efficient target identification and precise redshift measurements. We show that our method is able to retrieve a fairly complete ($C\sim 85\%$) and pure ($P\sim 90\%$) sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitting quasars for $L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}&gt;10^{44}$ ${\rm erg\,s}$$^{-1}$. In order to obtain corrections for the LF estimation, and assess the accuracy of our selection method, we produced mock catalogs of $0&lt;z&lt;4.3$ quasars and galaxies that mimic our target population and their main contaminants. Our results show a clear evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ and UV LFs, with a declining tendency in the number density of quasars towards increasing redshifts. In addition, the faint-end power-law slope of the Ly$\alpha$ LF becomes steeper with redshift, suggesting that the number density of Ly$\alpha$-bright quasars declines faster than that of fainter emitters. By integrating the Ly$\alpha$ LF we find that the total Ly$\alpha$ emitted by bright quasars per unit volume rapidly declines with increasing redshift, being sub-dominant to that of star-forming galaxies by several orders of magnitude by $z\sim 4$. Finally, we stack the NB pseudo-spectra of a visually selected "golden sample" of 591 quasars to obtain photometric composite SEDs in bins of redshift, enabling to measure the mean IGM absorption by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a function of redshift.</description>

      <title>A new "temperature inversion" estimator to detect CMB patchy screening by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons imprints various properties of the baryons around galaxies on the CMB. One such imprint, called patchy screening, is a direct probe of the gas density profile around galaxies. It usefully complements the information from the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and does not require individual redshifts. In this paper, we derive new estimators of patchy screening called the "temperature inversion" (TI) and "signed" estimators, analogous to the gradient inversion estimator of CMB lensing. Pedagogically, we clarify the relation between these estimators and the standard patchy screening quadratic estimator (QE). The new estimators trade optimality for robustness to biases caused by the dominant CMB lensing and foreground contaminants, allowing the use of smaller angular scales. We perform a simulated analysis to realistically forecast the expected precision of patchy screening measurements from four CMB experiments, ACT, SPT, Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4, cross-correlated with three galaxy samples from BOSS, unWISE and the simulated Rubin LSST Data Challenge 2 catalog. Our results give further confidence in the first detection of this effect from the ACT$\times$unWISE data in the companion paper and show patchy screening will be a powerful observable for future surveys like SO, CMB-S4 and LSST. Implementations of the patchy screening QE and the TI and signed estimators are publicly available in our LensQuEst and ThumbStack software packages, available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst and https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/ThumbStack , respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization in the JWST Era: Back to AGNs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4&lt; z&lt; 14 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, &gt;80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.</description>
