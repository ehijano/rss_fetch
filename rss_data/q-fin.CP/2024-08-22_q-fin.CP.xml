      <title>A case study on different one-factor Cheyette models for short maturity caplet calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], we calibrated a one-factor Cheyette SLV model with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark forward rate and an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance to 3M caplets of various maturities. While caplet smiles for many maturities could be reasonably well calibrated across the range of strikes, for instance the 1Y maturity could not be calibrated well across that entire range of strikes. Here, we study whether models with alternative local volatility terms and/or alternative stochastic volatility or variance models can calibrate the 1Y caplet smile better across the strike range better than the model studied in [1]. This is made possible and feasible by the generic simulation, pricing, and calibration frameworks introduced in [1] and some new frameworks presented in this paper. We find that some model settings calibrate well to the 1Y smile across the strike range under study. In particular, a model setting with a local volatility that is piece-wise linear in the benchmark forward rate together with an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance and one with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark rate together with a correlated lognormal stochastic volatility with quadratic drift (QDLNSV) as in [2] calibrate well. We discuss why the later might be a preferable model.

      <title>Dynamical analysis of financial stocks network: improving forecasting using network properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying a network analysis to stock return correlations, we study the dynamical properties of the network and how they correlate with the market return, finding meaningful variables that partially capture the complex dynamical processes of stock interactions and the market structure. We then use the individual properties of stocks within the network along with the global ones, to find correlations with the future returns of individual S&amp;P 500 stocks. Applying these properties as input variables for forecasting, we find a 50% improvement on the R2score in the prediction of stock returns on long time scales (per year), and 3% on short time scales (2 days), relative to baseline models without network variables.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Nash equilibrium and emergence of tacit collusion in a two-player optimal execution game with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms in financial trading is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the autonomous nature of these algorithms can lead to unexpected outcomes that deviate from traditional game-theoretical predictions and may even destabilize markets. In this study, we examine a scenario in which two autonomous agents, modeled with Double Deep Q-Learning, learn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact, using the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. Our results show that the strategies learned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding market impact game. Notably, the learned strategies exhibit tacit collusion, closely aligning with the Pareto-optimal solution. We further explore how different levels of market volatility influence the agents' performance and the equilibria they discover, including scenarios where volatility differs between the training and testing phases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Venture Capital(VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis or deep learning often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. Regarding the issues, we propose a novel approach using GrahphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application work of GraphRAG.</description>
