      <title>Two Complexity Results on Spanning-Tree Congestion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spanning-tree congestion problem ($\mathsf{STC}$), we are given a graph $G$, and the objective is to compute a spanning tree of $G$ that minimizes the maximum edge congestion. While $\mathsf{STC}$ is known to be $\mathbb{NP}$-hard, even for some restricted graph classes, several key questions regarding its computational complexity remain open, and we address some of these in our paper. (i) For graphs of degree at most $d$, it is known that $\mathsf{STC}$ is $\mathbb{NP}$-hard when $d\ge 8$. We provide a complete resolution of this variant, by showing that $\mathsf{STC}$ remains $\mathbb{NP}$-hard for each degree bound $d\ge 3$. (ii) In the decision version of $\mathsf{STC}$, given an integer $K$, the goal is to determine whether the congestion of $G$ is at most $K$. We prove that this variant is polynomial-time solvable for $K$-edge-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Streaming Stochastic Submodular Maximization with On-Demand User Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel problem in streaming submodular maximization, inspired by the dynamics of news-recommendation platforms. We consider a setting where users can visit a news website at any time, and upon each visit, the website must display up to $k$ news items. User interactions are inherently stochastic: each news item presented to the user is consumed with a certain acceptance probability by the user, and each news item covers certain topics. Our goal is to design a streaming algorithm that maximizes the expected total topic coverage. To address this problem, we establish a connection to submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint. We show that we can effectively adapt previous methods to address our problem when the number of user visits is known in advance or linear-size memory in the stream length is available. However, in more realistic scenarios where only an upper bound on the visits and sublinear memory is available, the algorithms fail to guarantee any bounded performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new online streaming algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(8\delta)$, where $\delta$ controls the approximation quality. Moreover, it requires only a single pass over the stream, and uses memory independent of the stream length. Empirically, our algorithms consistently outperform the baselines.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.</description>

      <title>A Polylogarithmic Competitive Algorithm for Stochastic Online Sorting and TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \emph{Online Sorting}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At each time step $t$, an element $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed irrevocably into an empty cell without any knowledge of future arrivals. We aim to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements placed in consecutive array cells, seeking an online placement strategy that results in a final array close to a sorted one. An interesting multidimensional generalization, a.k.a. the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem}, arises when the request sequence consists of points in the $d$-dimensional unit cube and the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances between points in consecutive cells. Motivated by the recent work of (Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen and Kozma; ESA 2024), we consider the \emph{stochastic version} of Online Sorting (\textit{resp.} Online TSP), where each element (\textit{resp.} point) $x_t$ is an i.i.d. sample from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$ (\textit{resp.} $[0,1]^d$). By carefully decomposing the request sequence into a hierarchy of balls-into-bins instances, where the balls to bins ratio is large enough so that bin occupancy is sharply concentrated around its mean and small enough so that we can efficiently deal with the elements placed in the same bin, we obtain an online algorithm that approximates the optimal cost within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ with high probability. Our result comprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen et al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to (Bertram, ESA 2025).</description>

      <title>Improved Streaming Algorithm for Fair $k$-Center Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the $\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process. Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases, transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$ and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Online Rack Placement in Large-Scale Data Centers: Online Sampling Optimization and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the configuration of large-scale data centers toward cost-effective, reliable and sustainable cloud supply chains. The problem involves placing incoming racks of servers within a data center to maximize demand coverage given space, power and cooling restrictions. We formulate an online integer optimization model to support rack placement decisions. We propose a tractable online sampling optimization (OSO) approach to multi-stage stochastic optimization, which approximates unknown parameters with a sample path and re-optimizes decisions dynamically. We prove that OSO achieves a strong competitive ratio in canonical online resource allocation problems and sublinear regret in the online batched bin packing problem. Theoretical and computational results show it can outperform mean-based certainty-equivalent resolving heuristics. Our algorithm has been packaged into a software solution deployed across Microsoft's data centers, contributing an interactive decision-making process at the human-machine interface. Using deployment data, econometric tests suggest that adoption of the solution has a negative and statistically significant impact on power stranding, estimated at 1-3 percentage point. At the scale of cloud computing, these improvements in data center performance result in significant cost savings and environmental benefits.</description>

      <title>Optimal learning of quantum channels in diamond distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard metric for distinguishing quantum processes. While the analogous problem of quantum state tomography has been settled over the past decades in both the pure- and mixed-state settings, for general quantum channels it remained largely open beyond the unitary case. Here we design an algorithm showing that any channel with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}},d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$ can be learned to constant accuracy in diamond distance using $\Theta(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k)$ channel uses, and we prove that this scaling is optimal via a matching lower bound. More generally, achieving accuracy $\varepsilon$ is possible with $O(d_{\mathrm{in}}d_{\mathrm{out}}k/\varepsilon^{2})$ channel uses. Since quantum channels subsume states, unitaries, and isometries as special cases, our protocol provides a unified framework for the corresponding tomography tasks; in particular, it yields the first optimal protocols for isometries and for binary measurement tomography, and it recovers optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach reduces channel tomography to pure-state tomography: we use the channel to prepare copies of its Choi state, purify them in parallel, and run sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the resulting purifications; we then show that the induced diamond-distance error scales essentially linearly with the trace-distance error in estimating the (purified) Choi state. We also resolve an open question by showing that adaptivity does not improve the dimension-optimal query complexity of quantum channel tomography.</description>
