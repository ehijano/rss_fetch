      <title>Arithmetic localisation and completion of spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an exposition of facts about p-local spectra, p-complete spectra and modules over the p-complete sphere spectrum, including homological criteria for finiteness. Most things are well-known to the experts, with a couple of potential exceptions: every dualisable p-complete spectrum is the p-completion of a finite spectrum, and the category of modules over the p-complete sphere has homological Brown representability.</description>

      <title>Classification of localizing subcategories along t-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between localizing subcategories in a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with $t$-structure $(\mathcal{C}_{\geq 0}, \mathcal{C}_{\leq 0})$, the prestable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}_{\geq 0}$ and the abelian category $\mathcal{C}^{\heartsuit}$. We prove that weak localizing subcategories of $\mathcal{C}^{\heartsuit}$ are in bijection with the localizing subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$ where object-containment can be checked on the heart. This generalizes similar known correspondences for noetherian rings and bounded $t$-structures. We also prove that this restricts to a bijection between localizing subcategories of $\mathcal{C}^{\heartsuit}$, and localizing subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$ that are kernels of $t$-exact functors -- lifting Lurie's correspondence between localizing subcategories in $\mathcal{C}_{\geq 0}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{\heartsuit}$ to the stable category $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also confront the results obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ with that for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Moreover, it provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Simplicial intersection homology revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intersection homology is defined for simplicial, singular and PL chains and it is well known that the three versions are isomorphic for a full filtered simplicial complex. In the literature, the isomorphism, between the singular and the simplicial situations of intersection homology, uses the PL case as an intermediate. Here we show directly that the canonical map between the simplicial and the singular intersection chains complexes is a quasi-isomorphism. This is similar to the classical proof for simplicial complexes, with an argument based on the concept of residual complex and not on skeletons. This parallel between simplicial and singular approaches is also extended to the intersection blown-up cohomology that we introduced in a previous work. In the case of an orientable pseudomanifold, this cohomology owns a Poincar\'e isomorphism with the intersection homology, for any coefficient ring, thanks to a cap product with a fundamental class. So, the blown-up intersection cohomology of a pseudomanifold can be computed from a triangulation. Finally, we introduce a blown-up intersection cohomology for PL spaces and prove that it is isomorphic to the singular one.</description>
