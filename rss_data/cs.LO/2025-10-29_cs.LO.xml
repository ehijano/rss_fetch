      <title>Formalizing Schwartz functions and tempered distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution theory is a cornerstone of the theory of partial differential equations. We report on the progress of formalizing the theory of tempered distributions in the interactive proof assistant Lean, which is the first formalization in any proof assistant. We give an overview of the mathematical theory and highlight key aspects of the formalization that differ from the classical presentation. As an application, we prove that the Fourier transform extends to a linear isometry on $L^2$ and we define Sobolev spaces via the Fourier transform on tempered distributions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hypersequents for Public Announcement Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Epistemic Logic extends classical epistemic logic by modeling not only static knowledge but also its evolution through information updates. Among its various systems, Public Announcement Logic (PAL) provides one of the simplest and most studied frameworks for representing epistemic change. While the semantics of PAL is well understood as transformation of Kripke models, the proof theory so far developed fails to represent this dynamism in purely syntactical terms. The aim of this paper is to repair this lack. In particular, building on a hypersequent calculus for S5, we extend it with a mechanism that models the transition between epistemic models induced by public announcements. We call these structures dynamic hypersequents. Using dynamic hypersequents, we construct a calculus for PAL and we show that it enjoys several desirable properties: admissibility of all structural rules (including contraction), invertibility of logical rules, as well as syntactic cut-elimination.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Multiparty Session Types with Global Escape Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparty session types are designed to abstractly capture the structure of communication protocols and verify behavioural properties. One important such property is progress, i.e., the absence of deadlock. Distributed algorithms often resemble multiparty communication protocols. But proving their properties, in particular termination that is closely related to progress, can be elaborate. Since distributed algorithms are often designed to cope with faults, a first step towards using session types to verify distributed algorithms is to integrate fault-tolerance.
  We extend FTMPST (a version of fault-tolerant multiparty session types with failure patterns to represent system requirements for system failures such as unreliable communication and process crashes) by a novel, fault-tolerant loop construct with global escapes that does not require global coordination. Each process runs its own local version of the loop. If a process finds a solution to the considered problem, it does not only terminate its own loop but also informs the other participants via exit-messages. Upon receiving an exit-message, a process immediately terminates its algorithm. To increase efficiency and model standard fault-tolerant algorithms, these messages are non-blocking, i.e., a process may continue until a possibly delayed exit-message is received. To illustrate our approach, we analyse a variant of the well-known rotating coordinator algorithm by Chandra and Toueg.</description>

      <title>An Adequacy Theorem Between Mixed Powerdomains and Probabilistic Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adequacy theorem for a concurrent extension of probabilistic GCL. The underlying denotational semantics is based on the so-called mixed powerdomains, which combine non-determinism with probabilistic behaviour. The theorem itself is formulated via M. Smyth's idea of treating observable properties as open sets of a topological space. The proof hinges on a 'topological generalisation' of K\"onig's lemma in the setting of probabilistic programming (a result that is proved in the paper as well). One application of the theorem is that it entails semi-decidability w.r.t. whether a concurrent program satisfies an observable property (written in a certain form). This is related to M. Escardo's conjecture about semi-decidability w.r.t. may and must probabilistic testing.</description>

      <title>Unique Solutions of Guarded Recursive Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that guarded systems of recursive equations have unique solutions up to strong bisimilarity for any process algebra with a structural operation semantics in the ready simulation format. A similar result holds for simulation equivalence, for ready simulation equivalence and for the (ready) simulation preorder. As a consequence, these equivalences and preorders are full (pre)congruences for guarded recursion. Moreover, the unique-solutions result yields a sound and ground-complete axiomatisation of strong bisimilarity for any finitary GSOS language.</description>

      <title>Traces via Strategies in Two-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traces form a coarse notion of semantic equivalence between states of a process, and have been studied coalgebraically for various types of system. We instantiate the finitary coalgebraic trace semantics framework of Hasuo et al. for controller-versus-environment games, encompassing both nondeterministic and probabilistic environments. Although our choice of monads is guided by the constraints of this abstract framework, they enable us to recover familiar game-theoretic concepts. Concretely, we show that in these games, each element in the trace map corresponds to a collection (a subset or distribution) of plays the controller can force. Furthermore, each element can be seen as the outcome of following a controller strategy. Our results are parametrised by a weak distributive law, which computes what the controller can force in a single step.</description>

      <title>Graded Monads in the Semantics of Nominal Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nominal automata models serve as a formalism for data languages, and in fact often relate closely to classical register models. The paradigm of name allocation in nominal automata helps alleviate the pervasive computational hardness of register models in a tradeoff between expressiveness and computational tractability. For instance, regular nondeterministic nominal automata (RNNAs) correspond, under their local freshness semantics, to a form of lossy register automata, and unlike the full register automaton model allow for inclusion checking in elementary complexity. The semantic framework of graded monads provides a unified algebraic treatment of spectra of behavioural equivalences in the setting of universal coalgebra. In the present work, we extend the associated notion of graded algebraic theory to the nominal setting. In the arising framework of graded nominal algebra, we give an algebraic theory capturing the local freshness semantics of RNNAs.</description>

      <title>Combining Textual and Structural Information for Premise Selection in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph capturing both state--premise and premise--premise relations. On the LeanDojo Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over 25% across standard retrieval metrics. These results demonstrate the power of relational information for more effective premise selection.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Neuro-Symbolic-Causal Architecture for Robust Multi-Objective AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+ formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios. These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.04728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the module-checking problem of pushdown multi-agent systems (PMS) against ATL and ATL* specifications. We establish that for ATL, module checking of PMS is 2EXPTIME-complete, which is the same complexity as pushdown module-checking for CTL. On the other hand, we show that ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL* model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher than triply exponential-time.</description>

      <title>Querying Inconsistent Prioritized Data with ORBITS: Algorithms, Implementation, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate practical algorithms for inconsistency-tolerant query answering over prioritized knowledge bases, which consist of a logical theory, a set of facts, and a priority relation between conflicting facts. We consider three well-known semantics (AR, IAR and brave) based upon two notions of optimal repairs (Pareto and completion). Deciding whether a query answer holds under these semantics is (co)NP-complete in data complexity for a large class of logical theories, and SAT-based procedures have been devised for repair-based semantics when there is no priority relation, or the relation has a special structure. The present paper introduces the first SAT encodings for Pareto- and completion-optimal repairs w.r.t. general priority relations and proposes several ways of employing existing and new encodings to compute answers under (optimal) repair-based semantics, by exploiting different reasoning modes of SAT solvers. The comprehensive experimental evaluation of our implementation compares both (i) the impact of adopting semantics based on different kinds of repairs, and (ii) the relative performances of alternative procedures for the same semantics.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms form a family of incomplete approaches to the graph isomorphism problem. They recently found various applications in algorithmic group theory and machine learning. In fact, the algorithms form a parameterized family: for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a corresponding $k$-dimensional algorithm $\texttt{WLk}$. The algorithms become increasingly powerful with increasing dimension, but at the same time the running time increases. The WL-dimension of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $\texttt{WLk}$ correctly decides isomorphism between $G$ and every other graph. In some sense, the WL-dimension measures how difficult it is to test isomorphism of one graph to others using a fairly general class of combinatorial algorithms. Nowadays, it is a standard measure in descriptive complexity theory for the structural complexity of a graph.
  We prove that the WL-dimension of a graph on $n$ vertices is at most $3/20 \cdot n + o(n) = 0.15 \cdot n + o(n)$. Reducing the question to coherent configurations, the proof develops various techniques to analyze their structure. This includes sufficient conditions under which a fiber can be restored uniquely up to isomorphism if it is removed, a recursive proof exploiting a degree reduction and treewidth bounds, as well as an exhaustive analysis of interspaces involving small fibers. As a base case, we also analyze the dimension of coherent configurations with small fiber size and thereby graphs with small color class size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure, reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and properties of irreducible cycloids are proved. In particular the synthesis of cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived, leading to an efficient method for a decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism.</description>

      <title>3D-Prover: Diversity Driven Theorem Proving With Determinantal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in automated formal reasoning is the intractable search space, which grows exponentially with the depth of the proof. This branching is caused by the large number of candidate proof tactics which can be applied to a given goal. Nonetheless, many of these tactics are semantically similar or lead to an execution error, wasting valuable resources in both cases. We address the problem of effectively pruning this search, using only synthetic data generated from previous proof attempts. We first demonstrate that it is possible to generate semantically aware tactic representations which capture the effect on the proving environment, likelihood of success, and execution time. We then propose a novel filtering mechanism which leverages these representations to select semantically diverse and high quality tactics, using Determinantal Point Processes. Our approach, 3D- Prover, is designed to be general, and to augment any underlying tactic generator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Prover on the miniF2F and LeanDojo benchmarks by augmenting popular open source proving LLMs. We show that our approach leads to an increase in the overall proof rate, as well as a significant improvement in the tactic success rate, execution time and diversity. We make our code available at https://github.com/sean-lamont/3D-Prover.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Nash Equilibrium Synthesis with Partially Ordered Temporal Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a central solution concept for reasoning about self-interested agents. We address the problem of synthesizing Nash equilibria in two-player deterministic games on graphs, where players have private, partially-ordered preferences over temporal goals. Unlike prior work, which assumes preferences are common knowledge, we develop a communication protocol for equilibrium synthesis in settings where players' preferences are private information. In the protocol, players communicate to synthesize equilibria by exchanging information about when they can force desirable outcomes. We incorporate privacy by ensuring the protocol stops before enough information is revealed to expose a player's preferences. We prove completeness by showing that, when no player halts communication, the protocol either returns an equilibrium or certifies that none exists. We then prove privacy by showing that, with stopping, the messages a player sends are always consistent with multiple possible preferences and thus do not reveal some given secret regarding a player's true preference ordering. Experiments demonstrate that we can synthesize non-trivial equilibria while preserving privacy of preferences, highlighting the protocol's potential for applications in strategy synthesis with constrained information sharing.</description>

      <title>The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These provide us with the first results on the logical expressiveness of temporal GNNs.</description>

      <title>JAX Autodiff from a Linear Logic Perspective (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autodiff refers to the core of the automatic differentiation systems developed in projects like JAX and Dex. Autodiff has recently been formalised in a linear typed calculus by Radul et al in arXiv:2204.10923. Although this formalisation suffices to express the main program transformations of Autodiff, the calculus is very specific to this task, and it is not clear whether the type system yields a substructural logic that has interest on its own.
  We propose an encoding of Autodiff into a linear $\lambda$-calculus that enjoys a Curry-Howard correspondence with Girard's linear logic. We prove that the encoding is sound both qualitatively (the encoded terms are extensionally equivalent to the original ones) and quantitatively (the encoding preserves the original work cost as described in arXiv:2204.10923). As a byproduct, we show that unzipping, one of the transformations used to implement backpropagation in Autodiff, is, in fact, optional.</description>
