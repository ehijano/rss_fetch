      <title>Spatial Dynamics of Synchronized Ants: A Mobile Oscillator Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronized short-term activity cycles are a prominent feature in the nests of certain ant species, but their functional significance remains controversial. This study investigates whether synchronization enhances spatial accessibility within ant nests, a factor critical for efficient task performance and colony fitness. We use the mobile oscillator model, a computational framework that simulates ant movement and synchronous activity, to examine the effect of synchronization on the spatial distribution of inactive ants, which act as obstacles to the movement of active ants. Our analysis reveals no significant effect of synchronization on the size of inactive ant clusters or on direct measures of spatial accessibility, such as the number of steps and net displacement during ant activity periods. These findings suggest that within the mobile oscillator model, synchronization does not directly enhance spatial accessibility, highlighting the need for more complex models to elucidate the intricate relationship between synchronization and spatial dynamics in ant colonies.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Protein Structure Prediction and Design: Key Model Developments by Nobel Laureates and Multi-Domain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review outlines pivotal advancements in deep learning-driven protein structure prediction and design, focusing on four core models-AlphaFold, RoseTTAFold, RFDiffusion, and ProteinMPNN-developed by 2024 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry: David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper. We analyze their technological iterations and collaborative design paradigms, emphasizing breakthroughs in atomic-level structural accuracy, functional protein engineering, and multi-component biomolecular interaction modeling. Key innovations include AlphaFold3's diffusion-based framework for unified biomolecular prediction, RoseTTAFold's three-track architecture integrating sequence and spatial constraints, RFDiffusion's denoising diffusion for de novo protein generation, and ProteinMPNN's inverse folding for sequence-structure co-optimization. Despite transformative progress in applications such as binder design, nanomaterials, and enzyme engineering, challenges persist in dynamic conformational sampling, multimodal data integration, and generalization to non-canonical targets. We propose future directions, including hybrid physics-AI frameworks and multimodal learning, to bridge gaps between computational design and functional validation in cellular environments.</description>

      <title>Learning and criticality in a self-organizing model of connectome growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of brain networks has reached an important milestone as relatively large and reliable information has been gathered for connectomes of different species. Analyses of connectome data sets reveal that the structural length and the distributions of in- and out-node strengths follow heavy-tailed lognormal statistics, while the functional network properties exhibit powerlaw tails, suggesting that the brain operates close to a critical point where computational capabilities and sensitivity to stimulus is optimal. Because these universal network features emerge from bottom-up (self-)organization, one can pose the question of whether they can be modeled via a common framework, particularly through the lens of criticality of statistical physical systems. Here, we simultaneously reproduce the powerlaw statistics of connectome edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node strengths from an avalanche-type model with learning that operates on baseline networks that mimic the neuronal circuitry. We observe that the avalanches created by a sandpile-like model on simulated neurons connected by a hierarchical modular network (HMN) produce robust powerlaw avalanche size distributions with critical exponents of 3/2 characteristic of neuronal systems. Introducing Hebbian learning, wherein neurons that `fire together, wire together,' recovers the powerlaw distribution of edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node degrees, comparable to those obtained from connectome data. Our results strengthen the notion of a critical brain, one whose local interactions drive connectivity and learning without a need for external intervention and precise tuning.</description>

      <title>Integrating experimental feedback improves generative models for biological sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative probabilistic models have shown promise in designing artificial RNA and protein sequences but often suffer from high rates of false positives, where sequences predicted as functional fail experimental validation. To address this critical limitation, we explore the impact of reintegrating experimental feedback into the model design process. We propose a likelihood-based reintegration scheme, which we test through extensive computational experiments on both RNA and protein datasets, as well as through wet-lab experiments on the self-splicing ribozyme from the group I intron RNA family where our approach demonstrates particular efficacy. We show that integrating recent experimental data enhances the model's capacity of generating functional sequences (e.g. from 6.7\% to 63.7\% of active designs at 45 mutations). This feedback-driven approach thus provides a significant improvement in the design of biomolecular sequences by directly tackling the false-positive challenge.</description>

      <title>Binding and dimerization control phase separation in a compartment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. In addition, we show that two-arm polymers accumulate within a finite-width active slab embedded in a passive background, and as the slab narrows, the polymers reorient perpendicular to the slab boundaries to remain within the active regions. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</description>
