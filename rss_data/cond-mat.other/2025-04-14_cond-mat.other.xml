      <title>Multi-band fractional Thouless pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization of particle transport lies at the heart of topological physics. In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Varying systems in a family leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossingn a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters.
  As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the ``topology breaks down''. We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka.\ winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These give a lower bond on the number of Dirac points in general that is sharp for 2-level systems. In the process, we treat several concrete models.
  In particular, we treat the lattices and tight--binding models, and show that effective winding maps can be achieved using $k$--th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. This includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic interactions in Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and the formation of skyrmion phases in centrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive X-ray and neutron scattering study of the structure and magnetic excitations of Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$, a sister compound of Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ which was recently found to host a skyrmion lattice phase despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modelled using mean-field random-phase approximation to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, e.g. Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liouvillian Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the ability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently challenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum from Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum Liouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian effects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages gradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and utilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability distributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark the protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering Hamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems. Finally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system implemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of Hamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently non-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of retrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data, thus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects in near-term quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>
