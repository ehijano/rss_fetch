      <title>Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</description>

      <title>Binary choice logit models with general fixed effects for panel and network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically analyzes and reviews identification strategies for binary choice logit models with fixed effects in panel and network data settings. We examine both static and dynamic models with general fixed-effect structures, including individual effects, time trends, and two-way or dyadic effects. A key challenge is the incidental parameter problem, which arises from the increasing number of fixed effects as the sample size grows. We explore two main strategies for eliminating nuisance parameters: conditional likelihood methods, which remove fixed effects by conditioning on sufficient statistics, and moment-based methods, which derive fixed-effect-free moment conditions. We demonstrate how these approaches apply to a variety of models, summarizing key findings from the literature while also presenting new examples and new results.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Women's Nighttime Ride-Hailing Intention: Evidence from an LC-ICLV Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While ride-hailing services offer increased travel flexibility and convenience, persistent nighttime safety concerns significantly reduce women's willingness to use them. Existing research often treats women as a homogeneous group, neglecting the heterogeneity in their decision-making processes. To address this gap, this study develops the Latent Class Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (LC-ICLV) model with a mixed Logit kernel, combined with an ordered Probit model for attitudinal indicators, to capture unobserved heterogeneity in women's nighttime ride-hailing decisions. Based on panel data from 543 respondents across 29 provinces in China, the analysis identifies two distinct female subgroups. The first, labeled the "Attribute-Sensitive Group", consists mainly of young women and students from first- and second-tier cities. Their choices are primarily influenced by observable service attributes such as price and waiting time, but they exhibit reduced usage intention when matched with female drivers, possibly reflecting deeper safety heuristics. The second, the "Perception-Sensitive Group", includes older working women and residents of less urbanized areas. Their decisions are shaped by perceived risk and safety concerns; notably, high-frequency use or essential nighttime commuting needs may reinforce rather than alleviate avoidance behaviors. The findings underscore the need for differentiated strategies: platforms should tailor safety features and user interfaces by subgroup, policymakers must develop targeted interventions, and female users can benefit from more personalized risk mitigation strategies. This study offers empirical evidence to advance gender-responsive mobility policy and improve the inclusivity of ride-hailing services in urban nighttime contexts.</description>

      <title>Stealing Accuracy: Predicting Day-ahead Electricity Prices with Temporal Hierarchy Forecasting (THieF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of temporal hierarchy forecasting (THieF) in predicting day-ahead electricity prices and show that reconciling forecasts for hourly products, 2- to 12-hour blocks, and baseload contracts significantly (up to 13%) improves accuracy at all levels. These results remain consistent throughout a challenging 4-year test period (2021-2024) in the German power market and across model architectures, including linear regression, a shallow neural network, gradient boosting, and a state-of-the-art transformer. Given that (i) trading of block products is becoming more common and (ii) the computational cost of reconciliation is comparable to that of predicting hourly prices alone, we recommend using it in daily forecasting practice.</description>

      <title>Approximate Factor Model with S-vine Copula Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximate factor models that integrates an S-vine copula structure to capture complex dependencies among common factors. Our estimation procedure proceeds in two steps: first, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the factors; second, we employ maximum likelihood estimation that combines kernel density estimation for the margins with an S-vine copula to model the dependence structure. Jointly fitting the S-vine copula with the margins yields an oblique factor rotation without resorting to ad hoc restrictions or traditional projection pursuit methods. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the consistency of the rotation and copula parameter estimators, developing asymptotic theory for the factor-projected empirical process under dependent data, and proving the uniform consistency of the projected entropy estimators. Simulation studies demonstrate convergence with respect to both the dimensionality and the sample size. We further assess model performance through Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation via Monte Carlo methods and apply our methodology to the daily returns of S&amp;P 500 Index constituents to forecast the VaR of S&amp;P 500 index.</description>
