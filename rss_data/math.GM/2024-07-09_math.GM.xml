      <title>Efficient Computation of Laplace Residual Power Series with Explicit Coefficient Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Residual Power Series Method (RPSM) provides a powerful framework for solving fractional differential equations. However, a significant computational bottleneck arises from the necessity of calculating the fractional derivatives of the residual function within the coefficient determination process. The Laplace Residual Power Series Method (LRPSM) partially addresses this by employing the Laplace transform. However, it introduces additional complexities and requires the computation of the residual error function at each iteration. This work presents a novel approach that directly derives explicit formulas for the coefficients, Bypassing the need for iterative residual error function calculations. This advancement significantly enhances the computational efficiency of the method compared to both RPS method and LRPS method.</description>

      <title>On the Simple Divisibility Restrictions by Polynomial Equation a n+bn=cn Itself in Fermat Last Theorem for Integer/Complex/Quaternion Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divisibility restrictions in the famous equation a n+bn=cn in Fermat Last Theorem (FLT, 1637) is analyzed how it selects out many triples to be Fermat triple (i.e. solutions) if n greater than 2, decreasing the cardinality of Fermat triples. In our analysis, the restriction on positive integer (PI) solutions ((a,b,c,n) up to the point when there is no more) is not along with restriction on power n in PI as decreasing sets {PI } containing {odd} containing {primes} containing {regular primes}, etc. as in the literature, but with respect to exclusion of more and more c in PI as increasing sets {primes p} in {p k} in {PI}. The divisibility and co-prime property in Fermat equation is analyzed in relation to exclusion of solutions, and the effect of simultaneous values of gcd(a,b,c), gcd(a+b,cn), gcd(c-a,bn) and gcd(c-b,an) on the decrease of cardinality of solutions is exhibited. Again, our derivation focuses mainly on the variable c rather than on variable n, oppositely to the literature in which the FLT is historically separated via the values of power n. Among the most famous are the known, about 2500 years old, existing Pythagorean triples (a,b,c,n=2) and the first milestones as the proved cases (of non-existence as n=3 by Gauss and later by Euler (1753) and n=4 by Fermat) less than 400 years ago. As it is known, Wiles has proved the FLT in 1995 in an abstract roundabout way. The n&lt;0, n:=1/m, as well as complex and quaternion (a,b,c) cases focusing on Pythagoreans are commented. Odd powers FLT over quaternions breaks.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Cantor Pairing Polynomials (Bijective Mapping Among Natural Numbers) from N02 to N0 to Z2 to N0 and N03 to N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cantor pairing polynomials are extended to larger 2D sub-domains and more complex mapping, of which the most important property is the bijectivity. If corners are involved inside (but not the borders of) domain, more than one connected polynomials are necessary. More complex patterns need more complex subsequent application of math series to obtain the mapping polynomials which are more and more inconvenient, although elementary. A tricky polynomial fit is introduced (six coefficients are involved like in the original Cantor polynomials with rigorous but simple restrictions on points chosen) to buy out the regular treatment of math series to find the pairing polynomials instantly. The original bijective Cantor polynomial C1(x,y)= (x2+2xy+y2+3x+y)/2: N02 to N0 (=positive integers) which is 2-fold and runs in zig - zag way along lines x+y=N is extended e.g. to the bijective P(x,y)= 2x2+4sgn(x)sgn(y)xy+2y2-2H(x)sgn(y)x-y+1: Z2 to N0 (with sign and Heaviside functions, Z is integers) running in spiral way along concentric rhombuses, or to the bijective P3D(x,y,z)= [x3+y3+z3 +3(xz2+yz2 +zx2+2xyz +zy2+yx2+xy2) +3(2x2+2y2 +z2+2xz +2yz+4xy) +5x+11y+2z]/6: N03 to N0 which is 6-fold and runs along plains x+y+z=N. Storage device for triangle matrices is also commented as cutting the original Cantor domain to half along with related Diophantine equations.</description>

      <title>Some Novel Results on (alpha, beta)-Ricci-Yamabe Soliton and its Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to investigate the characteristics of (alpha, beta) Ricci Yamabe soliton (briefly (alpha, beta) (RYS)) and its spacetime. The inclusion of killing vector field and the Lorentzian metrics make the Ricci-Yamabe soliton richer and interesting. We study the cosmological and dust fluid model on (RYS) equipped with Lorentzian para Sasakian (LPS) spacetime. The cases of eta-parallel Ricci tensor and the Poisson structure have been studied on (RYS) equipped with (LPS) manifold. Gradient (RYS) equipped with (LPS) manifold also reveal. Finally, we establish an example of four-dimensional LP Sasakian manifold (LPS) that satisfy (alpha, beta) (RYS) and some results.</description>

      <title>Cryptanalysis of RSA Cryptosystem: Prime Factorization using Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime factorization has been a buzzing topic in the field of number theory since time unknown. However, in recent years, alternative avenues to tackle this problem are being explored by researchers because of its direct application in the arena of cryptography. One of such applications is the cryptanalysis of RSA numbers, which requires prime factorization of large semiprimes. Based on numerical experiments, this paper proposes a conjecture on the distribution of digits on prime of infinite length. This paper infuses the theoretical understanding of primes to optimize the search space of prime factors by shrinking it upto 98.15%, which, in terms of application, has shown 26.50% increase in the success rate and 41.91% decrease of the maximum number of generations required by the genetic algorithm used traditionally in the literature. This paper also introduces a variation of the genetic algorithm named Sieve Method that is fine-tuned for factorization of big semi-primes, which was able to factor numbers up to 23 decimal digits with 84% success rate. Our findings shows that sieve methods on average has achieved 321.89% increase in success rate and 64.06% decrement in the maximum number of generations required for the algorithm to converge compared to the existing literatures.</description>

      <title>Simple Formulas for Univariate Multinomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine an underexplored property of polynomials, which states that under certain conditions, a polynomial can be completely determined by only two evaluations. Using this result, we derive new elementary formulas for univariate multinomial coefficients and their partial sums. Notably, we present what are potentially the first closed-form expressions for partial sums of binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>A rational approximation of the two-term Machin-like formula for $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the properties of the two-term Machin-like formula and develop an algorithm for computing digits of $\pi$ by using its rational approximation. In this approximation, both terms are constructed by using a representation of $1/\pi$ in the binary form. This approach provides the squared convergence in computing digits of $\pi$ without any trigonometric functions and surd numbers. The Mathematica codes showing some examples are presented.</description>
