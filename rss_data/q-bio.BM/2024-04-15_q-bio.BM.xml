      <title>AMPCliff: quantitative definition and benchmarking of activity cliffs in antimicrobial peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activity cliff (AC) is a phenomenon that a pair of similar molecules differ by a small structural alternation but exhibit a large difference in their biochemical activities. The AC of small molecules has been extensively investigated but limited knowledge is accumulated about the AC phenomenon in peptides with canonical amino acids. This study introduces a quantitative definition and benchmarking framework AMPCliff for the AC phenomenon in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) composed by canonical amino acids. A comprehensive analysis of the existing AMP dataset reveals a significant prevalence of AC within AMPs. AMPCliff quantifies the activities of AMPs by the metric minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and defines 0.9 as the minimum threshold for the normalized BLOSUM62 similarity score between a pair of aligned peptides with at least two-fold MIC changes. This study establishes a benchmark dataset of paired AMPs in Staphylococcus aureus from the publicly available AMP dataset GRAMPA, and conducts a rigorous procedure to evaluate various AMP AC prediction models, including nine machine learning, four deep learning algorithms, four masked language models, and four generative language models. Our analysis reveals that these models are capable of detecting AMP AC events and the pre-trained protein language ESM2 model demonstrates superior performance across the evaluations. The predictive performance of AMP activity cliffs remains to be further improved, considering that ESM2 with 33 layers only achieves the Spearman correlation coefficient=0.50 for the regression task of the MIC values on the benchmark dataset.

      <title>Drug Repurposing for Parkinson's Disease Using Random Walk With Restart Algorithm and the Parkinson's Disease Ontology Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive and slowly developing neurodegenerative disease, characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Despite extensive research by scientists, there is not yet a cure to this problem and the available therapies mainly help to reduce some of the Parkinson's symptoms. Drug repurposing (that is, the process of finding new uses for existing drugs) receives more appraisals as an efficient way that allows for reducing the time, resources, and risks associated with the development of new drugs. In this research, we design a novel computational platform that integrates gene expression data, biological networks, and the PDOD database to identify possible drug-repositioning agents for PD therapy. By using machine learning approaches like the RWR algorithm and PDOD scoring system we arrange drug-disease conversions and sort our potential sandboxes according to their possible efficacy. We propose gene expression analysis, network prioritization, and drug target data analysis to arrive at a comprehensive evaluation of drug repurposing chances. Our study results highlight such therapies as promising drug candidates to conduct further research on PD treatment. We also provide the rationale for promising drug repurposing ideas by using various sources of data and computational approaches.</description>
