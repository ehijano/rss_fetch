      <title>Quantifying Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions from reionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During reionization, intergalactic ionization fronts (I-fronts) are sources of Ly$\alpha$ line radiation produced by collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms within the fronts. In principle, detecting this emission could provide direct evidence for a reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we use a suite of high-resolution one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations run on cosmological density fields to quantify the parameter space of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency -- the ratio of emitted Ly$\alpha$ flux to incident ionizing flux driving the front -- depends mainly on the I-front speed and the spectral index of the ionizing radiation. IGM density fluctuations on scales smaller than the typical I-front width produce scatter in the efficiency, but they do not significantly boost its mean value. The Ly$\alpha$ flux emitted by an I-front is largest if 3 conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the incident ionizing flux is large; (2) the incident spectrum is hard, consisting of more energetic photons; (3) the I-front is traveling through a cosmological over-density, which causes it to propagate more slowly. We present a convenient parameterization of the efficiency in terms of I-front speed and incident spectral index. We make these results publicly available as an interpolation table and we provide a simple fitting function for a representative ionizing background spectrum. Our results can be applied as a sub-grid model for I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions in reionization simulations with spatial and/or temporal resolutions too coarse to resolve I-front structure. In a companion paper, we use our results to explore the possibility of directly imaging Ly$\alpha$ emission around neutral islands during the last phases of reionization.</description>

      <title>Imaging reionization's last phases with I-front Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long troughs observed in the $z &gt; 5.5$ Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ forests are thought to be caused by the last remaining neutral patches during the end phases of reionization -- termed neutral islands. If this is true, then the longest troughs mark locations where we are most likely to observe the reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). A key feature of the neutral islands is that they are bounded by ionization fronts (I-fronts) which emit Lyman series lines. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly imaging the outline of neutral islands with a narrowband survey targeting Ly$\alpha$. In a companion paper, we quantified the intensity of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions during reionization and its dependence on the spectrum of incident ionizing radiation and I-front speed. Here we apply those results to reionization simulations to model the emissions from neutral islands. We find that neutral islands would appear as diffuse structures that are tens of comoving Mpc across, with surface brightnesses in the range $\approx 1 - 5\times 10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. The islands are brighter if the spectrum of ionizing radiation driving the I-fronts is harder, and/or if the I-fronts are moving faster. We develop mock observations for current and futuristic observatories and find that, while extremely challenging, detecting neutral islands is potentially within reach of an ambitious observing program with wide-field narrowband imaging. Our results demonstrate the potentially high impact of low-surface brightness observations for studying reionization.</description>

      <title>The ACT-DR5 MCMF Galaxy Cluster Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are useful cosmological probes and interesting astrophysical laboratories. With growing cluster samples, a deeper understanding of the sample characteristics and improved control of systematics becomes more crucial. In this analysis we create a new and larger ACT-DR5-based thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (tSZE) selected galaxy cluster catalog with improved control over sample purity and completeness. We employ the red sequence based cluster redshift and confirmation tool MCMF together with optical imaging data from the Legacy Survey DR-10 and infrared data from the WISE satellite to systematicallyidentify true clusters from a new cluster candidate detection run on the ACT-DR5 dataset. The resulting ACT-DR5 MCMF sample contains 6,237 clusters with a residual contamination of 10.7%. This is an increase of 51% compared to the previous ACT-DR5 cluster catalog, making this catalog the largest tSZE-selected cluster catalog to date. The z&gt;1 subsample contains 703 clusters, three times more than in the previous ACT-DR5 catalog. Matching the ACT-DR5 MCMF cluster catalog with a deeper tSZE sample from SPTpol 500d allows us to confirm the completeness and purity of the new ACT-DR5 MCMF sample. Cross-matching to the two largest X-ray selected cluster samples, the all-sky RASS MCMF and the half-sky eRASS1, confirms the sample purity of the RASS MCMF sample and in the case of eRASS1 reveals that 43% of the matched clusters are designated in eRASS1 as X-ray point sources rather than clusters. Cross-correlating the ACT-DR5 MCMF cluster catalog with ACT-DR6 lensing maps results in a 16.4\sigma detection of CMB lensing around the clusters, corresponding to the strongest signal found so far for a galaxy cluster sample. Repeating the measurement for the z&gt;1 cluster subsample yields a significance of 4.3\sigma, which is the strongest CMB lensing detection in a z&gt;1 cluster sample to date.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmic anisotropy with Pade approximation and Pantheon+ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmography can be used to constrain the kinematics of universe in a model-independent way. In this work, we attempted to combine the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations with the latest Pantheon+ sample for testing cosmological principle. Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations, we first gave the cosmographic constraints on the different order polynomials including third-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$), fourth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,2)}$) and fifth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(3,2)}$). Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$ ($j_{0}$ = 1) polynomial and hemisphere comparison (HC) method, we tested the cosmological principle and found the preferred directions of cosmic anisotropy, such as (l, b) = (304.6$^{\circ}$$_{-37.4}^{+51.4}$, $-$18.7$^{\circ}$$_{-20.3}^{+14.7}$) and (311.1$^{\circ}$$_{-8.4}^{+17.4}$, $-$17.53$^{\circ}$$_{-7.7}^{+7.8}$) for $q_{0}$ and $H_{0}$, respectively. These two directions are consistent with each other in $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the corresponding results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real positions (RP) are quite different. The statistical significance of $H_{0}$ are stronger than that of $q_{0}$, i.e., 4.75$\sigma$ and 4.39$\sigma$ for the Isotropy and Isotropy with RP respectively. Reanalysis with fixed $q_{0} = -0.55$ (corresponds to $\Omega_{m}$ = 0.30) gives similar results. Overall, our model-independent results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy, which must be taken seriously. Further test is needed to better understand this signal.</description>

      <title>The importance of stochasticity in determining galaxy emissivities and UV LFs during cosmic dawn and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of star formation and photon propagation in high-redshift galaxies can result in sizable galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in their properties. Ignoring this scatter by assuming mean quantities can bias estimates of their emissivity and corresponding observables. We construct a flexible, semi-empirical model, sampling scatter around the following mean relations: (i) the conditional halo mass function (CHMF); (ii) the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR); (iii) galaxy star formation main sequence (SFMS); (iv) fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); (v) conditional intrinsic luminosity; and (vi) photon escape fraction. In our fiducial model, ignoring scatter in these galaxy properties overestimates the duration of the EoR, delaying its completion by up to $\Delta z$ ~ 2. We quantify the relative importance of each of the above sources of scatter in determining the ionizing, soft-band X-ray and Lyman Werner (LW) emissivities as a function of scale and redshift. We find that scatter around the SFMS is important for all bands, especially at the highest redshifts where the emissivity is dominated by the faintest, most "bursty" galaxies. Ignoring this scatter would underestimate the mean emissivity and its standard deviation computed over 5 cMpc regions by factors of up to $\sim$2-10 at $5&lt; z &lt; 15$. Scatter around the X-ray luminosity to star formation rate relation is important for determining X-ray emissivity, accounting for roughly half of its mean and standard deviation. The importance of scatter in the ionizing escape fraction depends on its functional form, while scatter around the SHMR contributes at the level of ~10-20%. Although scatter does flatten the UV luminosity functions, shifting the bright end by 1-2 magnitudes, the level of scatter in our fiducial model is insufficient to fully explain recent estimates from JWST photometry (consistent with previous studies).</description>

      <title>A model-independent measurement of the expansion and growth rates from BOSS using the FreePower method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a data analysis of the BOSS galaxy clustering data with the recently proposed FreePower method, which adopts as parameters the power spectrum band-powers instead of a specific cosmological parametrization. It relies on the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect and redshift-space distortions, and makes use of one-loop perturbation theory for biased tracers. In this way, we obtain for the first time constraints on the linear growth rate, on the Hubble parameter, as well as on various bias functions, that are independent of a model for the power spectrum shape and thus of both the early and late-time cosmological modelling. We find at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, $f=0.60^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$, $H/H_0=1.052^{+0.060}_{-0.041}$, and at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$, $f=0.69^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, $H/H_0=1.36\pm0.10$. The low-$z$ $H/H_0$ result is at over 2$\sigma$ tension with Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM results. The precision in these results demonstrates the capabilities of the FreePower method. We also get constraints on the bias parameters which are in agreement with constraints from previous BOSS analyses, which serves as a cross-check of our pipeline.</description>

      <title>Impact &amp; Mitigation of Polarized Extragalactic Foregrounds on Bayesian Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future low-noise cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from e.g., CMB-S4 will be polarization dominated, rather than temperature dominated. In this new regime, statistically optimal lensing reconstructions outperform the standard quadratic estimator, but their sensitivity to extragalactic polarized foregrounds has not been quantified. Using realistic simulations of polarized radio and infrared point sources, we show for the first time that optimal Bayesian lensing from a CMB-S4-like experiment is insensitive to the expected level of polarized extragalactic foregrounds after masking, as long as an accurate foreground power spectrum is included in the analysis. For more futuristic experiments where these foregrounds could cause a detectable bias, we propose a new method to jointly fit for lensing and the Poisson foregrounds, generalizing the bias hardening from the standard quadratic estimator to Bayesian lensing.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{cunuSHT}$: GPU Accelerated Spherical Harmonic Transforms on Arbitrary Pixelizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{cunusht}$, a general-purpose Python package that wraps a highly efficient CUDA implementation of the nonuniform spin-$0$ spherical harmonic transform. The method is applicable to arbitrary pixelization schemes, including schemes constructed from equally-spaced iso-latitude rings as well as completely nonuniform ones. The algorithm has an asymptotic scaling of $\mathrm{O}{(\ell_{\rm max}^3)}$ for maximum multipole $\ell_{\rm max}$ and achieves machine precision accuracy. While $\texttt{cunusht}$ is developed for applications in cosmology in mind, it is applicable to various other interpolation problems on the sphere. We outperform the fastest available CPU algorithm by a factor of up to 5 for problems with a nonuniform pixelization and $\ell_{\rm max}&gt;4\cdot10^3$ when comparing a single modern GPU to a modern 32-core CPU. This performance is achieved by utilizing the double Fourier sphere method in combination with the nonuniform fast Fourier transform and by avoiding transfers between the host and device. For scenarios without GPU availability, $\texttt{cunusht}$ wraps existing CPU libraries. $\texttt{cunusht}$ is publicly available and includes tests, documentation, and demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Finding dusty AGNs from the JWST CEERS survey with mid-infrared photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies remains an unsolved question. Therefore, conducting an AGN census is valuable to AGN research. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of AGNs are obscured by their environment, which blocks UV and optical emissions due to the dusty torus surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). To overcome this challenge, mid-infrared (IR) surveys have emerged as a valuable tool for identifying obscured AGNs, as the obscured light is re-emitted in this range. With its high sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uncovered more fainter objects than previous telescopes. By applying the SED fitting, this work investigates AGN candidates in JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields. We identified 42 candidates, 30 of them are classified as composites ($0.2\leq f_{\rm AGN, IR}&lt; 0.5$), and 12 of them are AGNs ($f_{\rm AGN, IR}\geq 0.5$). We report the AGN luminosity contributions and AGN number fractions as a function of redshift and total infrared luminosity, showing that previously reported increasing relations are not apparent in our sample due to the sample size. We also extend the previous results on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, $L_{\rm TIR}\geq 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) to less luminous AGNs, highlighting the power of JWST.</description>

      <title>Implications of NANOGrav results and UV freeze-in in a fast-expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing data reported by the NANOGrav collaboration indicates the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at a frequency $f\sim 10^{-8}~\rm Hz$. We show that a dark sector consisting of a Standard Model (SM) gauge singlet fermion $\chi$ and a singlet scalar $\phi$, both charged under a $Z_4$ symmetry, is capable of generating such a low frequency GW via strong first order phase transition (SFOPT) through the modification of the standard cosmological history, where we assume faster-than-usual expansion at pre-BBN times driven by a new cosmological species $\varphi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale factor as $\rho_\varphi\propto a^{-\left(4+n\right)}$. Depending on the choice of the fast expansion parameters, reheat temperature and effective scale of the theory, it is also possible to address correct dark matter (DM) relic abundance via freeze-in. We show that a successful first order phase transition explaining NANOGrav results together with PLANCK observed DM abundance put bound on the fast expansion parameters requiring $n\lesssim 4$ to explain both.</description>

      <title>A theoretical view of the T-web statistical description of the cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of the cosmic web into different environments is both a tool to study in more detail the formation of halos and galaxies via the link between their properties and the large-scale environment and as a class of objects whose statistics contain cosmological information. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to compute the probability of the different environments in the cosmic web based on the T-web formalism that classifies structures in four different classes (voids, walls, filaments, knots) by studying the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor (Hessian of the gravitational potential). This method relies on studying the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor with respect to a given threshold and thus requires the knowledge of the JPDF of those eigenvalues. We perform a change of variables in terms of minimally correlated rotational invariants and we study their distribution in the linear regime of structure formation, and in the quasi-linear regime with the help of a Gram-Charlier expansion and tree-order Eulerian perturbation theory. This expansion allows us to predict the probability of the different environments in the density field at a given smoothing scale as a function of the chosen threshold and redshift. We check the validity of our predictions by comparing those predictions to measurements made in the N-body Quijote simulations. We notably find that scaling the threshold value with the non-linear amplitude of fluctuations allows us to capture almost entirely the redshift evolution of the probability of the environments, even if we assume that the density field is Gaussian (corresponding to the linear regime of structure formation). We also show that adding mild non-Gaussian corrections in the form of third-order cumulants of the field provides even more precise predictions for cosmic web abundances up to scales as small as ~5 Mpc/h and redshifts down to z~0.</description>

      <title>SPT Clusters with DES and HST Weak Lensing. I. Cluster Lensing and Bayesian Population Modeling of Multi-Wavelength Cluster Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian population modeling method to analyze the abundance of galaxy clusters identified by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) with a simultaneous mass calibration using weak gravitational lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We discuss and validate the modeling choices with a particular focus on a robust, weak-lensing-based mass calibration using DES data. For the DES Year 3 data, we report a systematic uncertainty in weak-lensing mass calibration that increases from 1% at $z=0.25$ to 10% at $z=0.95$, to which we add 2% in quadrature to account for uncertainties in the impact of baryonic effects. We implement an analysis pipeline that joins the cluster abundance likelihood with a multi-observable likelihood for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, optical richness, and weak-lensing measurements for each individual cluster. We validate that our analysis pipeline can recover unbiased cosmological constraints by analyzing mocks that closely resemble the cluster sample extracted from the SPT-SZ, SPTpol ECS, and SPTpol 500d surveys and the DES Year 3 and HST-39 weak-lensing datasets. This work represents a crucial prerequisite for the subsequent cosmological analysis of the real dataset.</description>

      <title>Spectral Redundancy for Calibrating Interferometers and Suppressing the Foreground Wedge in 21cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of 21cm line from neutral hydrogen promise to be an exciting new probe of astrophysics and cosmology during the Cosmic Dawn and through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) to when dark energy accelerates the expansion of the Universe. At each of these epochs, separating bright foregrounds from the cosmological signal is a primary challenge that requires exquisite calibration. In this paper, we present a new calibration method called nucal that extends redundant-baseline calibration, allowing spectral variation in antenna responses to be solved for by using correlations between visibilities measuring the same angular Fourier modes at different frequencies. By modeling the chromaticity of the beam-weighted sky with a tunable set of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), we develop a calibration loop that optimizes for spectrally smooth calibrated visibilities. Crucially, this technique does not require explicit models of the sky or the primary beam. With simulations that incorporate realistic source and beam chromaticity, we show that this method solves for unsmooth bandpass features, exposes narrowband interference systematics, and suppresses smooth-spectrum foregrounds below the level of 21cm reionization models, even within much of the so-called "wedge" region where current foreground mitigation techniques struggle. We show that this foreground subtraction can be performed with minimal cosmological signal loss for certain well-sampled angular Fourier modes, making spectral-redundant calibration a promising technique for current and next-generation 21cm intensity mapping experiments.</description>

      <title>SPT Clusters with DES and HST Weak Lensing. II. Cosmological Constraints from the Abundance of Massive Halos</title>

Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from the abundance of galaxy clusters selected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in South Pole Telescope (SPT) data with a simultaneous mass calibration using weak gravitational lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample is constructed from the combined SPT-SZ, SPTpol ECS, and SPTpol 500d surveys, and comprises 1,005 confirmed clusters in the redshift range $0.25-1.78$ over a total sky area of 5,200 deg$^2$. We use DES Year 3 weak-lensing data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z&lt;0.95$ and HST weak-lensing data for 39 clusters with $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.7$. The weak-lensing measurements enable robust mass measurements of sample clusters and allow us to empirically constrain the SZ observable--mass relation. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and marginalizing over the sum of massive neutrinos, we measure $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.286\pm0.032$, $\sigma_8=0.817\pm0.026$, and the parameter combination $\sigma_8\,(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.25}=0.805\pm0.016$. Our measurement of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}=0.795\pm0.029$ and the constraint from Planck CMB anisotropies (2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE) differ by $1.1\sigma$. In combination with that Planck dataset, we place a 95% upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.18$ eV. When additionally allowing the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ to vary, we obtain $w=-1.45\pm0.31$ from our cluster-based analysis. In combination with Planck data, we measure $w=-1.34^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, or a $2.2\sigma$ difference with a cosmological constant. We use the cluster abundance to measure $\sigma_8$ in five redshift bins between 0.25 and 1.8, and we find the results to be consistent with structure growth as predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model fit to Planck primary CMB data.</description>

      <title>Comparing Mass Mapping Reconstruction Methods with Minkowski Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using higher-order statistics to capture cosmological information from weak lensing surveys often requires a transformation of observed shear to a measurement of the convergence signal. This inverse problem is complicated by noise and boundary effects, and various reconstruction methods have been developed to implement the process. Here we evaluate the retention of signal information of four such methods: Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, $\texttt{DarkMappy}$, and $\texttt{DeepMass}$. We use the higher order statistics $\textit{Minkowski functionals}$ to determine which method best reconstructs the original convergence with efficiency and precision. We find $\texttt{DeepMass}$ produces the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters, while Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, and $\texttt{DarkMappy}$ are similar at a smoothing scale of 3.5 arcmin. We also study the MF inaccuracy caused by inappropriate training sets in the $\texttt{DeepMass}$ method and find it to be large compared to the errors, underlining the importance of selecting appropriate training cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Bye bye, local bias: the statistics of the halo field are poorly determined by the local mass density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias models relating the dark matter field to the spatial distribution of halos are widely used in current cosmological analyses. Many models predict halos purely from the local Eulerian matter density, yet bias models in perturbation theory require the inclusion of other local properties. We assess the validity of assuming that only the local dark matter density can be used to predict the number density of halos in a model-independent way and in the non-perturbative regime. Utilising $N$-body simulations, we study the properties of the halo counts field after spatial voxels with near-equal dark matter density have been permuted. If local-in-matter-density biasing were valid, the statistical properties of the permuted and un-permuted fields would be indistinguishable since both represent equally fair draws of the stochastic biasing model. For voxels of side length $\sim4-30\,h^{-1}{\rm\,Mpc}$ and for halos less massive than $\sim10^{15}\,h^{-1}{\rm\,M_\odot}$, we find that the permuted halo field has a scale-dependent bias with greater than 25% more power on scales relevant for current surveys. These bias models remove small-scale power by not modelling correlations between neighbouring voxels, which substantially boosts large-scale power to conserve the field's total variance. This conclusion is robust to the choice of initial conditions and cosmology. Assuming local-in-matter-density halo biasing cannot, therefore, reproduce the distribution of halos across a large range of scales and halo masses, no matter how complex the model. One must either allow the biasing to be a function of other quantities and/or remove the assumption that neighbouring voxels are statistically independent.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity model, formulated as \( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (\texttt{OHD}); ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (\texttt{SNIa}); iii) a combined dataset (\texttt{OHD+SNIa}); and large scale structure datasets, including iv) 14 growth rate data points (\texttt{f}); and v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (\texttt{f}$\sigma_8$). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model's efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of weak lensing and 21cm intensity mapping cross-correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising probes to complement current standard cosmological surveys is the HI intensity map, i.e. the distribution of temperature fluctuations in neutral hydrogen. In this paper we present calculations of the 2-point function between HI (at redshift $z$ &lt; 1) and lensing convergence ($\kappa$). We also construct HI intensity maps from N-body simulations, and measure 2-point functions between HI and lensing convergence. HI intensity mapping requires stringent removal of bright foregrounds, including emission from our galaxy. The removal of large-scale radial modes during this HI foreground removal will reduce the HI-lensing cross-power spectrum signal, as radial modes are integrated to find the convergence; here we wish to characterise this reduction in signal. We find that after a simple model of foreground removal, the cross-correlation signal is reduced by $\sim$50-70\%; we present the angular and redshift dependence of the effect, which is a weak function of these variables. We then calculate S/N of $\kappa$HI detection, including cases with cut sky observations, and noise from radio and lensing measurements. We present Fisher forecasts based on the resulting 2-point functions; these forecasts show that by measuring $\kappa\Delta$$T_\mathrm{HI}$ correlation functions in a sufficient number of redshift bins, constraints on cosmology and HI bias will be possible</description>

      <title>Revisiting big bang nucleosynthesis with a new particle species : effect of co-annihilation with nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), the light matter abundance is dictated by the neutron-to-proton ($n/p$) ratio which is controlled by the standard weak processes in the early universe. Here, we study the effect of an extra particle species ($\chi$) which \textit{co-annihilates} with neutron (proton), thereby potentially changing the ($n/p$) ratio in addition to the former processes. We find a novel interplay between the co-annihilation and the weak interaction in deciding the ($n/p$) ratio and the yield of $\chi$. Large co-annihilation strength ($G_D$) in comparison to the weak coupling ($G_F$), potentially can alter the number of nucleons in the thermal bath modifying the ($n/p$) ratio from its standard evolution. We find that the standard BBN prediction is restored for $G_D/G_F \lesssim 10^{-2}$, while the mass of $\chi$ being much smaller than the neutron mass. When the mass of $\chi$ is comparable to the neutron mass, we can allow large $G_D/G_F ~(\gtrsim 10^2)$ values, as the thermal abundance of $\chi$ becomes Boltzmann-suppressed. Therefore, the ($n/p$) ratio is restored to its standard value via dominant weak processes in later epochs. We also discuss the stability of the new particle in an effective theroy framework for co-annihilation. Further, the co-annihilation interaction generates elastic scattering of $\chi$ and nucleons at the next-to-leading order. This provides a way to probe the scenario in direct detection experiments, if $\chi$ is accidentally stable over cosmological timescale.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration and the notion of Alternative Vacuum in Nash Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that Nash theory, a quadratic theory of Gravity, can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration without any exotic matter or cosmological constant. The observational viability of an exact cosmological solution of Nash theory is adjudged using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and JLA+OHD+BAO data sets. Departures from standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology are noted and analyzed. We prove that the Nash vacuum dynamics is equivalent to the dynamics of an Einstein vacuum plus a self-interacting Higgs scalar field, only if a mild evolution of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value is allowed. This leads to variations in the mass scales of fundamental particles and the fine structure constant. The variations are found to fit nicely with the analysis of molecular absorption spectra from a series of Quasars.</description>

      <title>A seesaw model for large neutrino masses in concordance with cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses can be relaxed if the number density of active neutrinos is reduced compared to the standard scenario, while at the same time keeping the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}\approx 3$ by introducing a new component of dark radiation. We discuss a UV complete model to realise this idea, which simultaneously provides neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. It is based on a $U(1)$ symmetry in the dark sector, which can be either gauged or global. In addition to heavy seesaw neutrinos, we need to introduce $\mathcal{O}(10)$ generations of massless sterile neutrinos providing the dark radiation. Then we can accommodate active neutrino masses with $\sum m_\nu \sim 1$ eV, in the sensitivity range of the KATRIN experiment. We discuss the phenomenology of the model and identify the allowed parameter space. We argue that the gauged version of the model is preferred, and in this case the typical energy scale of the model is in the 10 MeV to few GeV range.</description>

Abstract: We present a statistical study of 180 dust continuum sources identified in 33 massive cluster fields by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) over a total of 133 arcmin$^{2}$ area, homogeneously observed at 1.2 mm. ALCS enables us to detect extremely faint mm sources by lensing magnification, including near-infrared (NIR) dark objects showing no counterparts in existing {\it Hubble Space Telescope} and {\it Spitzer} images. The dust continuum sources belong to a blind sample ($N=141$) with S/N $\gtrsim$ 5.0 (a purity of $&gt;$ 0.99) or a secondary sample ($N=39$) with S/N= $4.0-5.0$ screened by priors. With the blind sample, we securely derive 1.2-mm number counts down to $\sim7$ $\mu$Jy, and find that the total integrated 1.2mm flux is 20.7$^{+8.5}_{-6.5}$ Jy deg$^{-2}$, resolving $\simeq$ 80 % of the cosmic infrared background light. The resolved fraction varies by a factor of $0.6-1.1$ due to the completeness correction depending on the spatial size of the mm emission. We also derive infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) at $z=0.6-7.5$ with the $1/V_{\rm max}$ method, finding the redshift evolution of IR LFs characterized by positive luminosity and negative density evolution. The total (=UV+IR) cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD) at $z&gt;4$ is estimated to be $161^{+25}_{-21}$ % of the established measurements, which were almost exclusively based on optical$-$NIR surveys. Although our general understanding of the cosmic SFRD is unlikely to change beyond a factor of 2, these results add to the weight of evidence for an additional ($\approx 60$ %) SFRD component contributed by the faint-mm population, including NIR dark objects.</description>

      <title>A new scale in the quasi-static limit of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the aims of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory (AeST) is to reproduce the successes of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. Indeed, the quasi-static limit of AeST achieves precisely this, assuming that the vector field $\vec{A}$ vanishes and that the so-called ghost condensate can be neglected. The effects of the ghost condensate were investigated in detail in previous studies. Here, we focus on the assumption of a vanishing vector field. We argue that this assumption is not always justified and show how to correctly take into account the vector field, finding that the quasi-static limit depends on a model parameter $m_\times$. In the limit $m_\times \to 0$, one recovers the quasi-static limit with a vanishing vector field. In particular, one finds a two-field version of MOND. In the opposite limit, $m_\times \to \infty$, one finds a single-field version of MOND. We show that, in practice, much of the phenomenology of the quasi-static limit depends only very little on the value of $m_\times$. Still, for some observational tests, such as those involving wide binaries, $m_\times$ has percent-level effects that may be important.</description>

      <title>Constraining the General Oscillatory Inflaton Potential with Freeze-in Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reheating phase after inflation is one of the least observationally constrained epochs in the evolution of the Universe. The forthcoming gravitational wave observatories will enable us to constrain at least some of the non-standard scenarios. For example, models where the radiation bath is produced by the perturbative inflaton decay that oscillates around the minimum of the potential of the form $V\propto\phi^{2n}$, with $n&gt;2$. In such scenarios a part of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum becomes blue tilted, making it observable, depending on the inflation energy scale and the reheating temperature. The degeneracy between the latter two parameters can be broken if dark matter in the Universe is produced via the freeze-in mechanism. The combination of the independent measurement of dark matter mass with gravitational wave observations makes it possible to constrain the reheating temperature and the energy scale at the end of inflation, at least within some parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>

Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulations of colliding superconducting strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collisions of elastic superconducting strings, also referred to as current-carrying strings, formed in a $U_{\rm local}(1) \times U_{\rm global}(1)$ field-theory model, using three-dimensional numerical field-theoretic simulations. The breaking of $U_{\rm local}(1)$ leads to string formation via the Higgs mechanism, while the scalar field of the second $U_{\rm global}(1)$ carries the current, which condenses onto the string. We construct straight and static superconducting string solutions numerically and identify the regions in which they exist in the model parameter space. We then perform dynamical simulations for colliding superconducting strings with various collision angles and collision velocities. We explore the kinematic parameter space for six sets of model parameters characterising the coupling between the two scalar fields and the current on the string. The final states of the strings (after the collision) are reported diagrammatically. We classify them into four categories: (i) regular intercommutation, (ii) double intercommutation, (iii) bound state, and (iv) expanding string solution. We find that the outcome of the collision process is the regular intercommutation of the colliding strings in most of the kinematic parameter space while they form bound states for small velocities and small angles. We also find that the strings undergo two successive intercommutations and, therefore, pass through one other in a small region corresponding to relatively small angles and velocities of order c/2. The string structure breaks down when there is a relatively large coupling between the two scalar fields, even if each string is stable before the occurrence of the collision.</description>

      <title>Probing the signature of axions through the quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion-photon coupling allows the existence of a magnetically and electrically charged black hole (BH) solution endowed with a pseudo-scalar hair. For the Reissner-Nordstrom BH with a given total charge and mass, it is known that the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are independent of the mixture between the magnetic and electric charges due to the presence of electric-magnetic duality. We show that the BH with an axion hair breaks this degeneracy by realizing nontrivial QNMs that depend on the ratio between the magnetic and total charges. Thus, the upcoming observations of BH QNMs through gravitational waves offer an exciting possibility for probing the existence of both magnetic monopoles and the axion coupled to photons.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black holes as dark matter using AMS-02 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during propagation in the Milky Way, potentially reaching energies up to the GeV level observed by AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ by employing the reacceleration mechanism. Under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution, our findings reveal that the limit is stricter than that derived from Voyager 1 data. This difference is particularly pronounced when $M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{15}\,{\rm g}$, exceeding an order of magnitude. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.</description>

      <title>AGEL: Is the Conflict Real? Investigating Galaxy Evolution Models using Strong Lensing at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations currently limited to $z \lesssim 0.5$. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts between $0.3 &lt; z_{\rm defl} &lt; 0.9$. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope $\gamma$, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm obs}$) for four lenses and obtain $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of $-1.95 \pm 0.09$ and a $\gamma$--$z$ relation that does not evolve with redshift at $z&lt;1$. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at $z&lt;1$ that suggest the $\gamma$--$z$ relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of 1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; 2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and 3) assuming a simple power-law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at $z_{\rm defl} &gt; 0.5$, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Closing the net on transient sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above $4\times10^{19}\,$eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within $0.5-20\,$nG for a coherence length of $10\,$kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above $50\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ for Local-Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below $5\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ ($30\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$) for the Milky Way (Local-Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below $4\times10^{54}\,$erg and above $5\times10^{50}\,$erg ($2\times10^{49}\,$erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas' and our criteria are long gamma-ray bursts.</description>
