      <title>Market-Implied Sustainability: Insights from Funds' Portfolio Holdings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop a market-implied sustainability score for companies, based on the extent to which a stock is over- or under-represented in sustainable funds compared to traditional ones. To identify sustainable funds, we rely on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), a European framework designed to clearly categorize investment funds into different classes according to their commitment to sustainability. In our analysis, we classify as sustainable those funds categorized as Article 9 - also known as "dark green" - and compare them to funds categorized as Article 8 or Article 6.
  We compute an SFDR Market-Implied Sustainability (SMIS) score for a large set of European companies. We then conduct an econometric analysis to identify the factors influencing SMIS and compare them with state-of-the-art ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores provided by Refinitiv. Finally, we assess the realized risk-adjusted performance of stocks using portfolio-tilting strategies.
  Our results show that SMIS scores deviate substantially from traditional ESG scores and that, over the period 2010-2023, companies with high SMIS have been associated with significant financial outperformance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Consumption-Investment with Epstein-Zin Utility under Leverage Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal portfolio choice under Epstein-Zin recursive utility in the presence of general leverage constraints. We first establish that the optimal value function is the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, by developing a new dynamic programming principle under constraints. We further demonstrate that the value function admits smoothness and characterize the optimal consumption and investment strategies. In addition, we derive explicit solutions for the optimal strategy and explicitly delineate the constrained and unconstrained regions in several special cases of the leverage constraint. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis, highlighting the differences relative to the classical time-separable preferences and to the setting without leverage constraints.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Continuous-time Stochastic Control with Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.</description>
