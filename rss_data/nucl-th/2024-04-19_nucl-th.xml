      <title>Systematic shell-model analysis of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr to the ground and excited states of $^{76}$Se and $^{96}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr isotopes utilizing large-scale shell-model calculations. The GWBXG effective interaction has been employed in the calculation of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs). We have tested the effective interaction by comparing the predicted spectroscopic properties, such as energy spectra and transition probabilities, with the available experimental data. The variation of cumulative NMEs with respect to the $1^+$ state energies of the intermediate nucleus is also studied, corresponding to $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s}$, $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions between the parent and granddaughter nuclei. The extracted half-lives using the shell-model predicted NMEs show good agreement with the recent experimental data. The comparison of the shell-model predicted NMEs with previous NMEs available in the literature is discussed. Also, the computed branching ratios for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and both the $2\nu\beta\beta$ and single-$\beta$ decay of $^{96}$Zr are reported.</description>

      <title>Study of structure of deuteron from analysis of bremsstrahlung emission in proton-deuteron scattering in cluster models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In this paper we investigated emission of bremsstrahlung photons in the scattering of protons off deuterons within the microscopic cluster models in a wide region of the beam energy from low energies up to 1.5 GeV. Methods: Three-cluster model of bremsstrahlung is constructed for such a reaction. Formalism of the model includes form factor of deuteron which characterizes dependence of bremsstrahlung cross sections on structure of deuteron. This gives possibility to investigate the structure of nuclei from analysis of bremsstrahlung cross sections. Results: We studied dependence of the bremsstrahlung cross section on the structure of deuteron. We use three different shapes of the deuteron wave functions. Besides, we also calculate the cross section by neglecting internal structure of deuteron. Analysis of dependence of the cross section on such a parameter shows the following. (1) At beam energies 145 and 195 MeV used in experiments bremsstrahlung cross section is not sensitive visibly on variations of the shape of the deuteron wave functions. (2) Stable difference between cross sections calculated with and without internal structure of deuteron is observed at higher energy of beam (larger 500 MeV). (3) The spectrum is increased as we pass from structureless deuteron (the oscillator length $b=0$) to the deuteron discribed by the shell-model wave function (the realistic oscillator length) inside the full energy region of the emitted photons. Conclusion: Our cluster model is a suitable tool to study the structure of deuteron with high enough precision from bremsstrahlung analysis. We propose new experiments for such an investigation.</description>

      <title>Single-channel, single-energy partial-wave analysis with continuity improved through minimal phase constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-energy partial-wave analysis has often been applied as a way to fit data with minimal model dependence. However, remaining unconstrained, partial waves at neighboring energies will vary discontinuously because the overall amplitude phase cannot be determined through single-channel measurements. This problem can be mitigated through the use of a constraining penalty function based on an associated energy-dependent fit. However, the weight given to this constraint results in a biased fit to the data. In this paper, for the first time, we explore a constraining function which does not influence the fit to data. The constraint comes from the overall phase found in multi-channel fits which, in the present study, are the Bonn-Gatchina and J\"ulich-Bonn multi-channel analyses. The data are well reproduced and weighting of the penalty function does not influence the result. The method is applied to $K \Lambda$ photoproduction data and all observables can be maximally well reproduced. While the employed multi-channel analyses display very different multipole amplitudes, we show that the major difference between two sets of multipoles can be related to the different overall phases.</description>

      <title>Gapless non-hydrodynamic modes in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously prove, for the first time, that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless in any relativistic kinetic theory whose scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. In fact, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the finite volume two-nucleon spectrum at $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a pion mass of $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, these results provide compelling evidence for the presence of an additional state in the low-energy spectrum not present in a non-interacting two-nucleon system. Within the space of operators that are considered in this work, the strongest overlap of this state is onto hexaquark operators, and variational analyses based on operator sets containing only dibaryon operators are insensitive to this state over the temporal extent studied here. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.</description>

      <title>Abnormal solutions of Bethe--Salpeter equation with massless and massive exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the main properties of the so called ''abnormal solutions'' of the Wick--Cutkosky model, i.e. two massive scalar particles interacting via massless scalar exchange ("photons"), within the Bethe--Salpeter equation. These solutions do not exist in the non-relativistic limit, in spite of having very small binding energies. They present a genuine many-body character dominated by photons, with a norm of the valence constituent wave function (two-body norm) that vanishes in the limit of zero binding energy.
  We present new results concerning the massive-exchange case, in particular determine under which conditions is it possible to obtain such peculiar solutions without spoiling the model by tachyonic states ($M^2&lt;0$).</description>

      <title>Dirac Spectral Density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at $T = 230$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide solid evidence that these IR features are stable and physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) support non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T \!=\! 230\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Nucleonic models at finite temperature with in-medium effective fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a calculation of dense and hot nuclear matter where the mean interaction between nucleons is described by in-medium effective fields and where we employ analytical approximations of the Fermi integrals. We generalize a previous work where we have addressed the case of the Fermi gas model with in-medium effective mass. In the present work, we fully treat the in-medium interaction by considering both its contribution to the in-medium effective fields, which can be subsumed by the mass in some cases, and to the potential term. Our formalism is general and could be applied to relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. It is illustrated for different popular models -- Skyrme, nonlinear, and density-dependent relativistic mean-field models --, but also for the metamodel, and it provides a clear understanding of the in-medium correction to the pressure, which is present in the case of the Skyrme and metamodel but is not for the relativistic ones. For the Fermi integrals, we compare the analytical approximation to the, so-called, ``exact'' numerical calculations in order to quantitatively estimate the accuracy of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Proto-strange quark stars from density-dependent quark mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evolution of strange quark stars (SQS) from birth as proto-strange quark stars to maturity as stable SQSs at a zero temperature. We assume that self-bound free quarks form {entirely the compact} star and study its evolution {through a series of snapshots} using a density-dependent quark mass model. We consider $\beta$-equilibrated stellar matter at two major stages of the star's evolution: neutrino trapped regime and neutrino transparent regime during the deleptonization and cooling processes of the star. We fix the entropy density per baryon and the lepton fraction to investigate the nuclear equation of state (EoS), particle distribution, temperature profile inside the star, sound velocity, polytropic index, and the structure of the star. Our results show that stars with higher neutrino concentrations are slightly more massive than the neutrino-poor ones along the evolution lines of the SQS. We obtain EoSs in agreement with the conformal boundary set through sound velocity, and also the 2 M$_\odot$ mass constraint for NSs was satisfied at all stages of the star's evolution.</description>

      <title>About the magnitude of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transverse amplitudes near $Q^2=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low-lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes.The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square-transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold [the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 &lt;0$], where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large-$Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge-invariant parametrization of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two elementary form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the two elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description of the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$,a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low-$Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.</description>

      <title>An optimized basis for hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new basis for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) tensor that is optimized for the evaluation of narrow-resonance contributions to HLbL scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. As main advantage, kinematic singularities are manifestly absent for pseudoscalar, scalar, and axial-vector states, while the remaining singularities for tensor resonances are minimized, even avoided for special cases, and simple crossing relations among the scalar functions maintained. We scrutinize the properties of this new basis for the scalar-QED pion box, demonstrating that the partial-wave convergence even slightly improves compared to our previous work, and discuss the physical sum rules that ensure basis independence of the HLbL contribution. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for narrow (pseudo-)scalar, axial-vector, and tensor intermediate states in terms of their respective transition form factors.</description>
