      <title>Hemodynamic effects of intra- and supra- deployment locations for a bio-prosthetic aortic valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aortic valve replacement is a key surgical procedure for treating aortic valve pathologies, such as stenosis and regurgitation. The precise placement of the prosthetic valve relative to the native aortic annulus plays a critical role in the post-operative hemodynamics. This study investigates how the positioning of a biological prosthetic valve-either intra-annular (within the native annulus) or supra-annular (slightly downstream, in the widened portion of the aortic root)-affects cardiac fluid dynamics. Using high-fidelity numerical simulations on a patient-specific left heart model derived from CT imaging, we simulate physiological flow conditions to isolate the impact of valve placement. Unlike previous clinical studies that compare different patients and valve models, our approach evaluates the same valve in both positions within a single virtual patient, ensuring a controlled comparison. Key hemodynamic parameters are assessed, including transvalvular pressure drop, effective orifice area, wall shear stress, and hemolysis. Results reveal that supra-annular implantation offers significant advantages: lower pressure gradients, larger orifice area, and reduced shear-induced stress. Furthermore, hemolysis analysis using advanced red blood cell stress models indicates a decreased risk of blood damage in the supra-annular configuration. These findings offer valuable insights to guide valve selection and implantation strategies, ultimately supporting improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>When water phase matters: its effect on the stopping cross section for proton therapy and astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the energy loss rate of proton beams in liquid water is crucial for the precise application and improvement of proton therapy, whereas the slowing down of proton in water ices also plays an important role in astrophysics. However, precisely determining the electronic stopping power, particularly for the liquid phase, has been elusive so far. Experimental techniques are difficult to apply to volatile liquids, and the availability of sufficient reliable measurements has been limited to the solid and vapor phases. The accuracy of current models is typically limited to proton energies just above the energy-loss maximum, making it difficult to predict radiation effects at an energy range of special relevance. We elucidate the phase differences in proton energy loss in water in a wide energy range (0.001-10 MeV) by means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Penn method. This non-perturbative model, more computationally-efficient than current approaches, describes the phase effects in water in excellent agreement with available experimental data, revealing clear deviations around the maximum of the stopping power curve and below. As an important outcome, our calculations reveal that proton stopping quantities of liquid water and amorphous ice are identical, in agreement with recent similar observations for low-energy electrons, pointing out to this equivalence for all charged particles. This could help to overcome the limitation in obtaining reliable experimental information for the biologically-relevant liquid water target.</description>

      <title>MRI Image Generation Based on Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of text-prompted MRI image generation with the Stable Diffusion (SD) model to address challenges in acquiring real MRI datasets, such as high costs, limited rare case samples, and privacy concerns. The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.</description>

      <title>PolyPose: Localizing Deformable Anatomy in 3D from Sparse 2D X-ray Images using Polyrigid Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.</description>
