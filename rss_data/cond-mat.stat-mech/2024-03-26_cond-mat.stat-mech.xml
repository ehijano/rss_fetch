      <title>A Brief Survey of Fluctuation-induced Interactions in Micro- and Nano-systems and One Exactly Solvable Model as Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations exist in any material object $A$. If $A$ has non-zero temperature $T$, one speaks about thermal fluctuations. If $A$ is at very low $T$, the fluctuations are of quantum origin. Interesting effects appear if two bodies $A$ and $B$ are separated by a fluctuating medium $C$ (say a vacuum, or a fluid close to its {\it critical point}) when the fluctuations are long-ranged, i.e., they decay according to a power-law with the distance. Then the changes of fluctuations in $C$ due to the surfaces and constituents of $A$ are also felt by $B$, and \textit{vice versa}, which leads to a fluctuation induced force (FIF) between them. This force persists in addition to the direct influence of $A$ on $B$ (say, via gravity or Coulomb's force). These FIF's can be of attractive or repulsive character. They may play crucially important role on phenomena involving objects with length scale comparative with the Universe, as well as to the tiny objects relevant for MEMS and NEMS. In the current article we present some basic facts for the FIF and their diversity. Then on the example of one dimensional Ising model with a defect bond we present some new analytical results for such forces.</description>

      <title>Floquet Prethermal Order by Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets can have accidental ground state degeneracies which may be lifted by various forms of disorder, for example in the form of thermal or quantum fluctuations. This order by disorder (ObD) paradigm is well established in equilibrium and here is generalized to Floquet many-body systems. Investigating a periodically-driven XXZ-compass model on the square lattice, we show that in a prethermal regime, dynamical fluctuations induced by high-frequency drives select a discrete set of states out of a degenerate ground state manifold of the lowest order Floquet Hamiltonian chosen as initial states. Remarkably, prior to the ObD selection, an unusual fluctuating regime emerges leading to a prethermalization timescale scaling linearly with the drive frequency. We argue that prethermal ObD with its unusual approach to the selected states is a generic phenomenon of driven frustrated systems and confirm it in the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ XX model.</description>

      <title>Applicability of mean-field theory for time-dependent open quantum systems with infinite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum many-body systems with long-range or infinite-range interactions is of relevance across a broad set of physical disciplines, including quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear physics. From a theoretical viewpoint, these systems are appealing since they can be efficiently studied with numerics, and in the thermodynamic limit are expected to be governed by mean-field equations of motion. Over the past years the capabilities to experimentally create long-range interacting systems have dramatically improved permitting their control in space and time. This allows to induce and explore a plethora of nonequilibrium dynamical phases, including time-crystals and even chaotic regimes. However, establishing the emergence of these phases from numerical simulations turns out to be surprisingly challenging. This difficulty led to the assertion that mean-field theory may not be applicable to time-dependent infinite-range interacting systems. Here, we rigorously prove that mean-field theory in fact exactly captures their dynamics, in the thermodynamic limit. We further provide bounds for finite-size effects and their dependence on the evolution time.</description>

      <title>The c-d conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Tensor network renormalization approach to antiferromagnetic 6-state clock model on the Union Jack lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the nuclear norm regularization techniques on tensor network renormalization algorithm, we study the phase diagram, the critical behavior and the duality property of the antiferromagnetic 6-state clock model on the Union Jack lattice. We find that this model undergoes multiple phase transitions; there is the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, $Z_{6}$ symmetry breaking and chiral transition with decreasing temperature. Furthermore, we provide convincing numerical evidence that its quasi-long range order is well explained by the compactified boson conformal field theory (CFT) and the chiral transition is in perfect agreement with the Ising CFT, including central charge, scaling dimension spectrum, and operator product expansion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect on non-equilibrium active Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Mpemba effect on a non-equilibrium Markov chain that mimics the run and tumble motion of an active particle in a discrete energy landscape. The broken detailed balance, rendered by the activity, gives rise to a unique anomalous relaxation in the system which is distinctly different than the typical equilibrium systems. We observe that the activity can both suppress or induce the Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we report an oscillatory Mpemba effect where the relaxation trajectories, emanating from the hot and cold initial conditions, cross each other multiple times and this occurs due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in the relaxation spectrum due to the activity. Our work reveals a possible pathway for studying the Mpemba effect in active living systems where broken detailed balance is crucial to achieve many biological functions.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilities are mathematical quantities describing the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

      <title>Symplectic quantization and the Feynman propagator: a new real-time numerical approach to lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here the first numerical test of symplectic quantization, a new approach to quantum field theory. Symplectic quantization is characterized by the possibility to sample quantum fluctuations of relativistic fields by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations, the latter evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$. In the present work we study numerically the symplectic quantization dynamics for a real scalar field in 1+1 space-time dimensions and with $\lambda \phi^4$ non-linear interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the Fourier spectrum of the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation over quantum fluctuations is computed as a dynamical average along the trajectories parametrized by the intrinsic time $\tau$. As a numerical strategy to study quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Lorentzian space-time, we believe that symplectic quantization will be of key importance for the study of non-equilibrium relaxational dynamics in quantum field theory and the phenomenology of metastable bound states with very short life-time, something usually not accessible by numerical methods based on Euclidean field theory.</description>

      <title>On the Lattice Ground State of Densely Packed Hard Ellipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among lattice configurations of densely packed hard ellipses, Monte Carlo simulations are used to identify the so-called parallel and diagonal lattices as the two favourable states. The free energies of these two states are computed for several system sizes employing the Einstein Crystal method. An accurate calculation of the free energy difference between the two states reveals the parallel lattice as the state with lowest free energy. The origin of the entropic difference between the two states is further elucidated by assessing the roles of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it effects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph theoretical interpretation of the mean first passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on epidemic processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The position response of a particle subjected to a perturbation is of general interest in physics. We study the modification of the position response function of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap in the presence of tunable light-assisted interactions. We subject the cold atoms to an intense laser light tuned near the photoassociation resonance and observe the position response of the atoms subjected to a sudden displacement. Surprisingly, we observe that the entire cold atomic cloud undergoes collective oscillations. We use a generalised quantum Langevin approach to theoretically analyse the results of the experiments and find good agreement.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous Hydrodynamics at Infinite Temperature in a Long-Range XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive. However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model, classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator, mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable quantum many-body systems</description>

      <title>Simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group for high-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01895v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions (i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group (SRG) as the generalizations of classic approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a high-order propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. The proposed SRG, equipped with a divide-and-conquer framework, can deal with the absence of ergodicity arised from the sparse distribution of high-order interactions and renormalize a system with intertwined high-order interactions on $p$-order according to its properties on $q$-order ($p\leq q$). The associated scaling relation and its corollaries support to differentiate among scale-invariant, weakly scale-invariant, and scale-dependent systems across different orders. We have validated our theory in multi-order scale-invariance verification, topological invariance discovery, organizational structure identification, and information bottleneck analysis to demonstrate its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting systems during system reduction.</description>

Abstract: Different neural network architectures can be unsupervisedly or supervisedly trained to represent quantum states. We explore and compare different strategies for the supervised training of feed forward neural network quantum states. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of feed forward neural network quantum states in different phases of matter for variants of the architecture, for different hyper-parameters, and for two different loss functions, to which we refer as \emph{mean-squared error} and \emph{overlap}, respectively. We consider the next-nearest neighbor Ising model for the diversity of its phases and focus on its paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and pair-antiferromagnetic phases. We observe that the overlap loss function allows better training of the model across all phases, provided a rescaling of the neural network.</description>

Abstract: Partial, frustrated synchronization and chimera-like states are expected to occur in Kuramoto-like models if the spectral dimension of the underlying graph is low: $d_s &lt; 4$. We provide numerical evidence that this really happens in case of the high-voltage power grid of Europe ($d_s &lt; 2$), a large human connectome (KKI113) and in case of the largest, exactly known brain network corresponding to the fruit-fly (FF) connectome ($d_s &lt; 4$), even though their graph dimensions are much higher, i.e.: $d^{EU}_g\simeq 2.6(1)$ and $d^{FF}_g\simeq 5.4(1)$, $d^{\mathrm{KKI113}}_g\simeq 3.4(1)$. We provide local synchronization results of the first- and second-order (Shinomoto) Kuramoto models by numerical solutions on the FF and the European power-grid graphs, respectively, and show the emergence of \red{chimera-like} patterns on the graph community level as well as by the local order parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Frustration - no frustration crossover and phase transitions in 2D spin models with zig-zag structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three 2D spin models made of frustrated zig-zag chains with competing interactions which by exact summation with respect to some degrees of freedom can be replaced by an effective temperature-dependent interaction were considered. The first model, exactly solvable Ising chains coupled by only four-spin interactions does not exhibit any finite temperature phase transition, nevertheless temperature can trigger a frustration - no frustration crossover accompanied by gigantic specific heat. A similar effect was observed in several two-leg ladder models [Yin Weiguo, arXiv:2006.08921v2 (2020), 2006.15087v1 (2020)]. The anisotropic Ising chains coupled by a direct interchain interaction and competing with it indirect interaction via spins located between chains are analyzed by using exact Onsager's equation and linear perturbation renormalization group (LPRG). Depending on the parameter set such a model exhibits one antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition or three phase transitions with reentrant disordered phase between AF and FM ones. The LPRG method was also used to study coupled uniaxial $XXZ$ chains which, for example, can be a minimal model to describe the magnetic properties of compounds in which uranium and rare earth atoms form zig-zag chains. As with the Ising model for a certain set of parameters the model can undergo three phase transitions. However, both inchain and interchain plain interactions $s_{i,j}^x s_{k,l}^x+s_{i,j}^y s_{k,l}^y$ can eliminate the reentrant disordered phase and then only one transition takes place. Additionally, the $XXZ$ model can undergo temperature-induced metamagnetic transition.</description>

      <title>Spectral Triples on Thermodynamic Formalism and Dixmier Trace Representations of Gibbs: theory and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.01362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study spectral triples and non-commutative expectations associated to expanding and weakly expanding maps. In order to do so, we generalize the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle theorem and obtain a polynomial decay of the operator, which allows to prove differentiability of a dynamically defined $\zeta$-function at its critical parameter. We then generalize Sharp's construction of spectral triples to this setting and provide criteria when the associated spectral metric is non-degenerate and when the non-commutative expectation of the spectral triple is colinear to the integration with respect to the associated equilibrium state from thermodynamic formalism. Due to our general setting, we are able to simultaneously analyse expanding maps on manifolds or connected fractals, subshifts of finite type as well as the Dyson model from statistical physics, which underlines the unifying character of noncommutative geometry. Furthermore, we derive an explicit representation of the $\zeta$-function associated to a particular class of pathological continuous potentials, giving rise to examples where the representation as a non-commutative expectation via the associated zeta function holds, and others where it does not hold.</description>

      <title>When is cross impact relevant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trading pressure from one asset can move the price of another, a phenomenon referred to as cross impact. Using tick-by-tick data spanning 5 years for 500 assets listed in the United States, we identify the features that make cross-impact relevant to explain the variance of price returns. We show that price formation occurs endogenously within highly liquid assets. Then, trades in these assets influence the prices of less liquid correlated products, with an impact velocity constrained by their minimum trading frequency. We investigate the implications of such a multidimensional price formation mechanism on interest rate markets. We find that the 10-year bond future serves as the primary liquidity reservoir, influencing the prices of cash bonds and futures contracts within the interest rate curve. Such behaviour challenges the validity of the theory in Financial Economics that regards long-term rates as agents anticipations of future short term rates.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity expression for a graphene system in relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have gone through the detailed microscopic calculation of the shear viscosity of a 2-dimensional graphene system in the relaxation time approximation-based kinetic theory framework. After getting its final expressions, we compared it with the shear viscosity expressions of other possible 2-dimensional as well as 3-dimensional nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic fluid systems. The aim of the comparison is to reveal how their different one-body dispersion relations affect their many-body fluid properties like shear viscosity and the viscosity to entropy density ratio. It is also aimed to reveal the 3-dimension to the 2-dimension transformation of their mathematical structures. We have numerically explored the differences in their order of magnitude and dependence on thermodynamical parameters-temperature and chemical potential. Marking two thermodynamical domains-Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid-for a 2-dimensional graphene system, we have noticed that shear viscosity, entropy density as well as their ratios decrease toward saturated values when one goes from Fermi liquid to Dirac fluid domain. When one shifts from mili-electron volt scales of temperature and chemical potential in condensed matter physics location to their mega-electron volt scales in high energy physics location, then the same results may be expected for hot quark matter case, where the transition from the neutron star to early universe domains may be considered as Fermi liquid to Dirac fluid transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement on Fractal Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Induced Associations in the Double Layer of Salt-in-Ionic-Liquid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an extremely exciting class of electrolytes for energy storage applications because of their unique combination of properties. Upon dissolving alkali metal salts, such as Li or Na based salts, with the same anion as the IL, an intrinsically asymmetric electrolyte can be created for use in batteries, known as a salt-in-ionic liquid (SiIL). These SiILs have been well studied in the bulk, where negative transference numbers of the alkali metal cation have been observed from the formation of small, negatively charged clusters. The properties of these SiILs at electrified interfaces, however, have received little to no attention. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double layer (EDL) of SiILs where we consistently account for the thermoreversible association of ions into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts that the IL cations first populate the EDL at negative voltages, as they are not strongly bound to the anions. However at large negative voltages which are strong enough to break the alkali metal cation-anion associations, these IL cations are exchanged for the alkali metal cation because of their higher charge density. At positive voltages, we find that the SiIL actually becomes $\textit{more aggregated while screening the electrode charge}$ from the formation of large, negatively charged aggregates. Therefore, in contrast to conventional intuition of associations in the EDL, SiILs appear to become more associated in certain electric fields. We present these theoretical predictions to be verified by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects. In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>
