      <title>NP-completeness of determining unit distance graphs with integer coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining whether a graph G can be realized as a unit-distance graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with integer-valued coordinates is NP-complete. We implement Eades and Whitesides' logic engine in this setting, and construct a graph that is realizable if and only if an arbitrary NA3SAT formula is satisfiable.</description>

      <title>Affine Predicate Geometry: A Courcelle-Type Metatheorem for Rank-Bounded Pseudo-Boolean Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many discrete optimization problems -- including low-rank quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), trimmed covariance, and cardinality-constrained pseudo-Boolean programs -- share a common structure: the gain of any elementary move (bit-flip or swap) can be expressed as an affine form in a low-dimensional feature map $\phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^R$. We call this the Affine--Predicate Condition, and show that it captures all rank-structured pseudo-Boolean objectives, including higher-order forms via multilinear lifting. We prove an Affine--Predicate Meta--Theorem: under this condition, every locally optimal solution must lie in a chamber of a central hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^{R+1}$, defined by the zero-sets of these affine gains. These chambers can be enumerated in $m^{O(R)}$ time, where $m$ is the number of elementary feasible directions. Consequently, exact optimization is in XP time $n^{O(R)}$ in the effective rank $R$, even under uniform matroid (cardinality) constraints. As a corollary, we obtain the first unified $n^{O(r)}$ exact algorithm for rank-$r$ QUBO and its cardinality-constrained extension. This establishes rank as a structural parameter for discrete optimization, analogous to treewidth in algorithmic graph theory and Courcelle-type meta-theorems.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Complexity Classes Revisited: Lower Bounds and Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study oblivious complexity classes. These classes capture the power of interactive proofs where the prover(s) are only given the input size rather than the actual input. In particular, we study the connections between the symmetric polynomial time $\mathsf{S_2P}$ and its oblivious counterpart $\mathsf{O_2P}$. Among our results, we construct an explicit language in $\mathsf{O_2P}$ that cannot be computed by circuits of size $n^k$, and thus prove a hierarchy theorem for $\mathsf{O_2TIME}$. Along the way we also make partial progress towards the resolution of an open question posed by Goldreich and Meir (TOCT 2015) that relates the complexity of $\mathsf{NP}$ to its oblivious counterpart $\mathsf{ONP}$. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first explicit fixed-polynomial lower bound and hierarchy theorem for $\mathsf{O_2P}$. The smallest uniform complexity class for which such lower bounds were previously known was $\mathsf{S_2P}$, due to Cai (JCSS 2007). In addition, this is the first uniform hierarchy theorem for a semantic class. All previous results required some non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>PLS-complete problems with lexicographic cost functions: Max-$k$-SAT and Abelian Permutation Orbit Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How hard is it to find a local optimum? If we are given a graph and want to find a locally maximal cut--meaning that the number of edges in the cut cannot be improved by moving a single vertex from one side to the other--then just iterating improving steps finds a local maximum since the size of the cut can increase at most $|E|$ times. If, on the other hand, the edges are weighted, this problem becomes hard for the class PLS (Polynomial Local Search)[16].
  We are interested in optimization problems with lexicographic costs. For Max-Cut this would mean that the edges $e_1,\dots, e_m$ have costs $c(e_i) = 2^{m-i}$. For such a cost function, it is easy to see that finding a global Max-Cut is easy. In contrast, we show that it is PLS-complete to find an assignment for a 4-CNF formula that is locally maximal (when the clauses have lexicographic weights); and also for a 3-CNF when we relax the notion of local by allowing to switch two variables at a time.
  We use these results to answer a question in Scheder and Tantow[15], who showed that finding a lexicographic local minimum of a string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$ under the action of a list of given permutations $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k \in S_{n}$ is PLS-complete. They ask whether the problem stays PLS-complete when the $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ commute, i.e., generate an Abelian subgroup $G$ of $S_n$. In this work, we show that it does, and in fact stays PLS-complete even (1) when every element in $G$ has order two and also (2) when $G$ is cyclic, i.e., all $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ are powers of a single permutations $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Worst-Case to Average-Case Reduction for Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worst-case to average-case reductions are a cornerstone of complexity theory, providing a bridge between worst-case hardness and average-case computational difficulty. While recent works have demonstrated such reductions for fundamental problems using deep tools from ad- ditive combinatorics, these approaches often suffer from substantial complexity and suboptimal overheads. In this work, we focus on the quantum setting, and provide a new reduction for the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem that is more efficient, and conceptually simpler than previous constructions. By adapting hardness self-amplification techniques to the quantum do- main, we obtain a quantum worst-case to average-case reduction with improved dependence on the success probability, laying the groundwork for broader applications in quantum fine-grained complexity.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Matching Integer Programs with Additional Rows and Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study integer linear programs (ILP) of the form $\min\{c^\top x\ \vert\ Ax=b,l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb Z^n\}$ and analyze their parameterized complexity with respect to their distance to the generalized matching problem, following the well-established approach of capturing the hardness of a problem by the distance to triviality. The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each column of the constraint matrix has a $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures several well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow problems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors, which measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to obtain a generalized matching ILP.
  We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor to generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p+h$ of a mixed variable plus constraint backdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary; (iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving ILPs is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of a minimum constraint backdoor $h$ even when all coefficients are bounded. To obtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of weighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex functions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint on the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved using an FPT integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time algorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact matching problem. To prevent an exponential blowup in terms of the encoding length of $b$, we bound the proximity of the ILP through a subdeterminant based circuit bound.</description>

      <title>Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we study the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 &lt; d = o(n^{1/2})$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques -- the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the computation of tensor functions under tensor-tensor multiplications with linear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the computation of both algebraic and non-algebraic tensor functions under the tensor-tensor multiplication with linear maps. In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Turing Ensembles, Pareto's Law, and Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths. We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions, this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories. Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split: machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and therefore no averaging of the same kind.</description>
