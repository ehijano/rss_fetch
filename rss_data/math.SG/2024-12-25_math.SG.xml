      <title>Revisit Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds of dimension 6 with 4 fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the circle acts in a Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. The case that there are exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various reasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed points, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed points, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the manifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are classified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove Tolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that the integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the moment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed points is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use these ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral cohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct approach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.</description>

      <title>A proof of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original proof of the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem [Gro85] is based on pseudo-holomorphic curves. The central ingredient is the compactness of the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic spheres in the symplectic manifold $(\mathbb{CP}^1\times T^{2n-2}, \omega_{\mathrm{FS}}\oplus \omega_{\mathrm{std}})$ representing the homology class $[\mathbb{CP}^1\times\{\operatorname{pt}\}]$. In this article, we give two proofs of this compactness. The fact that the moduli space carries the minimal positive symplectic area is essential to our proofs. The main idea is to reparametrize the curves to distribute the symplectic area evenly and then apply either the mean value inequality for pseudo-holomorphic curves or the Gromov-Schwarz lemma to obtain a uniform bound on the gradient. Our arguments avoid bubbling analysis and Gromov's removable singularity theorem, which makes our proof of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem more elementary.</description>

      <title>Manturov Projection for Virtual Legendrian Knots in $ST^*F$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kauffman virtual knots are knots in thickened surfaces $F\times R$ considered up to isotopy, stabilizations and destabilizations, and diffeomorphisms of $F\times R$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$. Similarly, virtual Legendrian knots, introduced by Cahn and Levi~\cite{CahnLevi}, are Legendrian knots in $ST^*F$ with the natural contact structure. Virtual Legendrian knots are considered up to isotopy, stabilization and destabilization of the surface away from the front projection of the Legendrian knot, as well as up to contact isomorphisms of $ST^*F$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$.
  We show that there is a projection operation $proj$ from the set of virtual isotopy classes of Legendrian knots to the set of isotopy classes of Legendrian knots in $ST^*S^2$. This projection is obtained by substituting some of the classical crossings of the front diagram for a virtual crossing. It restricts to the identity map on the set of virtual isotopy classes of classical Legendrian knots. In particular, the projection $proj$ extends invariants of Legendrian knots to invariants of virtual Legendrian knots. Using the projection $proj$, we show that the virtual crossing number of every classical Legendrian knot equals its crossing number. We also prove that the virtual canonical genus of a Legendrian knot is equal to the canonical genus.
  The construction of $proj$ is inspired by the work of Manturov.</description>

      <title>Tropical Lagrangian coamoebae and free resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coamoebae of Lagrangian submanifolds of $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$, specifically how the combinatorics of their degenerations encodes the homological algebra of mirror coherent sheaves. Concretely, to a minimal free resolution $F^\bullet$ of a module $M$ over $\mathbb{C}[z_1^{\pm 1}, \dotsc, z_n^{\pm 1}]$ we associate a simplicial complex $T(F^\bullet) \subset T^n$. We call $T(F^\bullet)$ a tropical Lagrangian coamoeba. We show that the discrete information in $F^\bullet$ can often be recovered from $T(F^\bullet)$, and that more generally $M$ is mirror to a certain constructible sheaf supported on $T(F^\bullet)$. The resulting interplay between coherent sheaves on $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$ and simplicial complexes in $T^n$ provides a higher-dimensional generalization of the spectral theory of dimer models in $T^2$, as well as a symplectic counterpart to the theory of brane brick models.</description>

      <title>Qusimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>A geometric description of some thermodynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how almost cosymplectic structures are a natural framework to study thermodynamical systems. Indeed, we are able to obtain the same evolution equations obtained previously by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura (see Entropy, 21(8):39, 2019) using variational arguments. The proposed geometric description allows us to apply geometrical tools to discuss reduction by symmetries, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation or discretization of these systems.</description>
