      <title>Air-Stable Room-Temperature Quasi-2D Tin Iodide Perovskite Microlasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D tin iodide perovskites (TIPs) are promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications, but achieving stable lasing remains challenging due to their limited environmental stability. Here, we report air-stable, room-temperature lasing from quasi-2D TIP microcrystals as small as 4 {\mu}m. Incorporation of the organic spacer 5IPA3 significantly enhanced the stability of these materials compared to previously reported TIPs. Lasing was observed from both dielectric (n=4) and plasmonic (n=3 and n=4) TIP microlasers. Under picosecond pumping, lasing was sustained for over 10^8 pump pulses in ambient conditions. These results represent a significant step toward practical photonic applications of tin-based perovskites.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical microscopy with an obscuration-free, freeform reflective objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) imaging platforms traditionally rely on refractive microscope objectives, which suffer from chromatic aberrations and temporal dispersion of pulsed excitation light. These issues degrade spatial imaging properties and signal brightness. Furthermore, the limited transmission range of refractive materials restricts NLO imaging, especially for applications requiring short- to mid-wave infrared excitation. While reflective microscope objectives offer an achromatic solution and broader transmission range (from visible to mid-infrared), conventional Schwarzschild designs have a central obscuration, which limits transmission throughput, imparts diffraction effects into the images, and, more generally, hinders the adoption of reflective optics in NLO microscopy. We overcome these obscuration-based limitations by developing a novel, reflective microscope objective using freeform mirrors in a non-coaxial geometry. This innovative, obscuration-free design boasts a 0.65 numerical aperture (NA), near diffraction-limited imaging performance, and offers significantly improved transmission with wider fields-of-view. We demonstrate its utility by integrating it into a standard laser-scanning microscope and performing NLO microscopy across a wide range of excitation wavelengths. Our freeform microscope objective outperforms standard reflective designs, providing an achromatic, dispersion-free alternative to refractive lenses for NLO imaging.</description>

      <title>Massively parallel and universal approximation of nonlinear functions using diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear computation is essential for a wide range of information processing tasks, yet implementing nonlinear functions using optical systems remains a challenge due to the weak and power-intensive nature of optical nonlinearities. Overcoming this limitation without relying on nonlinear optical materials could unlock unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast and parallel optical computing systems. Here, we demonstrate that large-scale nonlinear computation can be performed using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors composed of passive phase-only surfaces. In this framework, the input variables of nonlinear functions are encoded into the phase of an optical wavefront, e.g., via a spatial light modulator (SLM), and transformed by an optimized diffractive structure with spatially varying point-spread functions to yield output intensities that approximate a large set of unique nonlinear functions, all in parallel. We provide proof establishing that this architecture serves as a universal function approximator for an arbitrary set of bandlimited nonlinear functions, also covering multi-variate and complex-valued functions. We also numerically demonstrate the parallel computation of one million distinct nonlinear functions, accurately executed at wavelength-scale spatial density at the output of a diffractive optical processor. Furthermore, we experimentally validated this framework using in situ optical learning and approximated 35 unique nonlinear functions in a single shot using a compact setup consisting of an SLM and an image sensor. These results establish diffractive optical processors as a scalable platform for massively parallel universal nonlinear function approximation, paving the way for new capabilities in analog optical computing based on linear materials.</description>

      <title>Electrothermally Modulated Nanophotonic Waveguide-integrated Ring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable integrated chips of photonic components and networks are envisaged to play a key role in realizing highly efficient integrated photonic information processing. Electrothermally modulated optical effect (ETMOE) is a powerful thermo-optic tuning mechanism for silicon photonic devices, enabling precise optical control via localized Joule heating. We present a rigorous and three-dimensional electronic-photonic co-integrated approach with the nonlinear numerical coupling of temperature and wavelength-dependent material properties to comprehensively model ETMOE in silicon waveguides and resonators. A platinum-based symmetric heater is optimized using advanced true 3D numerical simulations, achieving efficient ETMOE-based tuning while mitigating asymmetric heat distribution. In addition to a complete design and analysis of the fully integrated three-dimensional switch, we also evaluate single-mode waveguide cutoff, heater-to-waveguide separation, heater dimensions, and thermal dissipation, providing a framework for ETMOE-based optimization. The findings contribute to energy-efficient, programmable photonic systems for neuromorphic computing, optical interconnects, and reconfigurable photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Aperture Geometry in THz-TDS for Accurate Spectroscopy of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a powerful platform for investigating low-energy excitations in quantum materials. Because these materials are often limited in size, experimental setups typically rely on tightly focused beams and metallic holders with small apertures. In this work, we perform a systematic study of how aperture geometry influences THz signal transmission in a standard free-space configuration. By analyzing time- and frequency-domain data for circular apertures of varying diameters and thicknesses, we quantify the spatial and spectral filtering effects imposed by aperture size. We show that small apertures progressively attenuate low-frequency components of the transmitted signal, while higher-frequency content remains comparatively unaffected. These effects become especially significant for apertures smaller than typical THz beam waists, resulting in amplitude suppression and phase distortions that compromise the accuracy of frequency-domain analysis and optical parameter retrieval. The transmitted intensity as a function of aperture diameter also provides a straightforward method for estimating the beam waist at the focus. In contrast, standard aperture thicknesses do not introduce measurable distortions, confirming the adequacy of treating thick, non-resonant apertures as dielectric slabs. These findings establish practical guidelines for aperture selection in THz-TDS and underscore the importance of preserving low-frequency response for reliable characterization of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Photonic bandgap properties of hyperuniform systems self-assembled in a microfluidic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional self-assembly methods often rely on densely packed colloidal crystalline structures and have inherent limitations in generating materials with isotropic photonic bandgaps (PBG). This study explores the photonic properties of materials structured according to hyperuniform disordered patterns (HUDS) generated via a hydrodynamic process in a microchannel. This research employs simulations to characterize optical bandgaps and determine the minimum dielectric contrast required for PBG formation in structures based on the templates experimentally formed under various conditions during the hydrodynamic process. The optimal conditions in the hydrodynamic process for realizing PBG have been identified. The findings offer a promising avenue for the large-scale production of isotropic photonic bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Neutron-induced opalescence in silica glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scattering intensity distribution along the optical fiber length is analyzed, which was measured by optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) during and after fiber irradiation in a nuclear reactor. The OTDR traces prove to contain two components associated with either radiation-induced attenuation (RIA), or with Rayleigh scattering coefficient (RSC) variation. The RSC increase effect in the first stage of fast-neutron irradiation is argued to be similar to the anomalous scattering buildup near the critical point of the liquid-vapor transition known as critical opalescence. For his reason, the RSC increase due to fast-neutron irradiation can be named neutron-induced opalescence (NIO).</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries in laser harmonic generation via a cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work on harmonic generation with complex light [Nature Communications 15, 6878 (2024)], we demonstrated how the harmonic spectrum of a complex laser beam in a nonlinear medium can be obtained through the judicious application of the ``beat wave'' concept. In this paper, we show how the same results can be obtained via the full set of symmetries of the initial laser-target configuration, and how this can be reconciled with the ``beat wave'' approach. We also highlight the connections between our work and existing theory for diffraction of EM waves from crystals: Laue equations, Mathieu equation, and theorems by Noether, Floquet and Bloch. The specific nature of our approach to harmonic spectra allows these connections to be revealed. We illustrate this with numerous examples taken from existing literature to show the wide applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Polarization dynamics in vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments and their interpretation on polarization dynamics and polarization switching in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers operated in the fundamental transverse mode regime are reviewed. Important observations are switching events to a mode with the lower unsaturated gain and the existence of elliptically polarized dynamical transition states after the destabilization of the low-frequency polarization mode. The observations demonstrate the need to consider explicitly the phase properties of the optical field as well as nonlinear effects affecting polarization selection above threshold. Good qualitative agreement is found with a model which takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the light field as well as of the carriers (`spin-flip model'), if the spin-flip rate is taken to be some tens of $10^9$~s$^{-1}$. This constitutes a strong -- though indirect -- indication that spin dependent processes are important in polarization selection in the devices investigated.</description>

      <title>Cavity-less Brillouin strong coupling in a solid-state continuous system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</description>

      <title>New scattering zones in quantum speckle propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum speckles exhibit significantly richer behavior than their classical counterparts due to their higher dimensionality. A simple example is the far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles. To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Single DNA Docking Site Activity With Sequential Modes of an Optoplasmonic Whispering-Gallery Mode Biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid advancement in single-molecule techniques, driven by their unparalleled precision in studying molecules whose sizes are beyond the diffraction limit. Among these techniques, optoplasmonic whispering gallery mode sensing has demonstrated great potential in label-free single-molecule characterization. It combines the principles of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensing, offering exceptional sensing capabilities, even at the level of single ions. However, current optoplasmonic WGM sensing operates in a multiplexed channel, making it challenging to focus on individual binding sites of analyte molecules. In this article, we characterize different binding sites of DNA analyte molecules hybridizing to docking strands on the optoplasmonic WGM sensor, using the ratio of the resonance shift between sequential polar WGM modes. We identify specific docking sites that undergo transient interactions and eventually hybridize with the complementary analyte strands permanently.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Generation of Fano Resonance with No Symmetry Breaking in THz Hybrid Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fano resonance, arising from the interference between a discrete resonance and a continuum of states, results in sharp and asymmetric line shapes and has significant applications in advanced photonic devices, particularly in sensing, filtering, and nonlinear optics. Nowadays, metasurfaces comprised of engineering microstructures play a crucial role in generation and manipulation of Fano resonance in photonics. However, current metasurfaces dominantly rely on local symmetry breaking of the microstructures to induce Fano resonances, which significant limits their tunability and scalable fabrication for practical applications. To address the challenge, a metal-dielectric hybrid metasurface is demonstrated to achieve nonlocal generation of Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking in the terahertz (THz) band. The Fano resonance, including its existence and peak frequency, is sensitively controlled by the thickness and dielectric constant of the dielectric layer, which is experimentally observed. Our analysis elucidates that the metallic layer with a pair of dumbbell holes leads to the band folding and coupling of guided modes within the dielectric layer. When the thickness or dielectric constant surpasses a critical value, the guided mode resonance falls below the diffraction limit, resulting in a unique nonlocal Fano resonance due to the interaction between the resonance and background transmission facilitated by dumbbell holes. Furthermore, the Fano transmission peak corresponds to an anapole excitation, revealed by multipole calculations. Benefiting from the ability to control the Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking, the proposed hybrid THz metasurface will advance broad applications in the fields of sensors, optical switches, and tunable filters.</description>

      <title>Obstructed Atomic Limit Topological Protection in C4-Symmetric Photonic Crystals for Optical Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in photonic topological phases have revealed that protected edge modes can emerge not only from global topological invariants, but also from symmetry-enforced polarization mismatches between distinct bulk phases. In this work, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of a square-lattice ($C_4$-symmetric) photonic crystal composed of a single dielectric material that supports interface-localized modes at the boundary between regions characterized by distinct obstructed atomic limits (OALs). These modes are confined to a common band gap and exhibit high transmission, even in the presence of structural perturbations.
  Our analysis reveals that the interface modes are stabilized by a mismatch in the position of Wannier centers between the two adjoining crystals. We demonstrate nearly lossless transmission around sharp turns and through localized defects, though the robustness depends asymmetrically on the side of perturbation, reflecting the partial nature of the protection. We also show that increasing the number of photonic crystal periods surrounding the interface enhances both modal confinement and spectral stability. These findings establish polarization mismatch between OALs as a practical and fabrication-compatible mechanism for engineering robust photonic transport in \(C_4\)-symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Perspective of high-speed Mach-Zehnder modulators based on nonlinear optics and complex band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical modulators are essential building blocks for high-capacity optical communication and massively parallel computing. Among all types of optical modulators, travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs) featuring high speed and efficiency are widely used, and have been developed on a variety of integrated material platforms. Existing methods to design and simulate TW-MZMs so far strongly rely on the peculiar material properties, and thus inevitably involve complicated electrical-circuit models. As a result, these methods diverge significantly. In addition, they become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate for TW-MZMs with extending length and levitating modulation speed, posing formidable challenges for millimeter-wave and terahertz operation. Here, we present an innovative perspective to understand and analyze high-speed TW-MZMs. Our perspective leverages nonlinear optics and complex band structures of RF photonic crystals, and is thus entirely electromagnetic-wave-based. Under this perspective, we showcase the design, optoelectronic simulation and experimental validation of high-speed TW-MZMs based on Si and LiNbO$_3$, and further demonstrate unambiguous advantages in simplicity, accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods. Our approach can essentially be applied to nearly any integrated material platform, including those based on semiconductors and electro-absorption materials. With high-frequency electrode designs and optoelectronic co-simulation, our approach facilitates the synergy and convergence of electronics and photonics, and offers a viable route to constructing future high-speed millimeter-wave and terahertz photonics and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Meron Spin Textures in Momentum Space Spawning from Bound States in the Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological spin textures, such as merons and skyrmions, have shown significance in both fundamental science and practical applications across diverse physical systems. The optical skyrmionic textures in real space have been extensively explored, but which in momentum space are still rarely studied. Here, we report the experimental generation of momentum-space meron spin textures via bound states in the continuum (BICs) in photonic crystal slabs. We show that under circularly polarized illumination, the momentum-space vortex topology of BICs can transform light with meron spin textures in momentum space. These merons exhibit polarity-switchable configurations controlled by incident light polarization. We theoretically and experimentally verify the generation of momentum-space merons and demonstrate their operational flexibility across a broad spectral range. Our results establish a connection between different momentum-space topologies and provide a robust and compact platform for generating topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR hyperspectral imaging with undetected photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around 10$^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

Abstract: We present an innovative optical imaging system for measuring parameters of a small particle such as a macromolecule or nanoparticle at the quantum limit of sensitivity. In comparison to the conventional confocal interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approach, our setup adds a second arm to form a Michelson interferometer that allows us to tune a relative phase. We evaluate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) for different quantum states, including single-mode coherent states, multi-frequency coherent states, and phase-averaged coherent states. Our results show that the proposed setup can achieve the QCRB of sensitivity and outperform iSCAT for all considered quantum states for mass and phase estimation of a particle.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>

      <title>PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of Multi-Level Atoms embedded in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photon-atom bound states lying in the bandgap region. The entanglement is preserved for extended times due to stronger RDDI, when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel for both quantum-correlated and separable initial states. For orthogonally oriented atomic dipoles, initially entangled states display a distinctive oscillatory entanglement behavior characterized by non-Markovian effects such as delayed feedback and entanglement revival. In contrast, initially separable states experience a more rapid decay of entanglement under these conditions. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes. Our analysis establishes RDDI and quantum interference as potential tools for controlling entanglement lifetimes in photonic crystal environments, offering new strategies for engineered quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>
