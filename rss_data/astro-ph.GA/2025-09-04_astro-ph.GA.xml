      <title>No Luminous Little Red Dots: A Sharp Cutoff in Their Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z&gt;4$. Their spatial density ($\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}\gtrsim 10^{45-46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K&lt;23.7$) at $4.5&lt;z&lt;4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z_\mathrm{phot}\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M_{5100}&lt;-23.5)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\lambda L_{5100}\approx2.5\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $&lt; 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 &lt; M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] &lt; 5\times10^4$ within $&lt;1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Ecosystem IN Galaxies (BEINGMgII) -- III. Cool gas reservoirs at $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$ in the Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of intervening cool MgII absorption detected in the spectra of background quasars and the nature of associated galaxies across a broad redshift range of $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$. Using nebular [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 emission lines identified in DESI fiber spectra centered on quasar, we detect 377 galaxies at a typical detection rate of $\sim$0.45% at $z \lesssim 1$, which increases with MgII equivalent width ($W_{2796}$). A significant fraction (74%) of these galaxies are associated with strong absorbers with $W_{2796} \ge$ 2\r{A}. These absorbers trace galaxies spanning stellar masses of $\rm 8.4 \le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le 11.6$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\rm -1.2 \le log(SFR~[M_{\odot}yr^{-1}]) \le 2.7$, located at projected galactocentric distances of 4-24 kpc. We find the average MgII absorber strength increases from 2.1\r{A} to 2.9\r{A} between redshifts $z \sim$ 0.4 and 1.2, indicating evolution in the cool gas content of galaxy halos. The relatively constant absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights the dynamical nature of CGM. However, the majority of this gas remains gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos, consistent with a picture of gas recycling via galactic fountains.</description>

      <title>Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (&lt; 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in &gt;10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Exploring the origin of the Type Ia supernova host galaxy step through Si II velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their host galaxy stellar masses is well documented. In particular, Hubble residuals display a luminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often used as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here we investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II $\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide the sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated at 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links between Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour $c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or progenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between the Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \pm 0.024$ mag ($6.3\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\sigma$), consistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\sim 2.2\sigma$. The clearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} &lt; 1$), where NV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a $3.1-3.6\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \pm 0.024$ mag ($5.9\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\sigma$). Overall, NV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} &gt; 1$), while NV SNe show stronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally sensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV SNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step correction could introduce biases. Refined classifications or environment-dependent factors may improve future cosmological analyses beyond standard $x_{1}$ and $c$ cuts.</description>

      <title>The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: II. Warm Molecular Hydrogen and Warm Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of $\sim 3$% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in $\sim 120$ pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly $&gt; 3$ has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of $\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T $\geq 50$K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 $\mu$m; possible identification as Al$_2$O$_3$ is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering the Milky Way with an orbit superposition approach and APOGEE data V. The disc growth and history of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way's (MW's) star formation history (SFH) offers insight into the chronology of its assembly and the mechanisms driving its structural development. In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z &gt; 2$ ($\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and grew to a present-day size of $\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary peak in SFR $\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc, which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Cosmic Ray Halos from Bursty Star Formation and Active Galactic Nuclei: Semi-Analytic Formalism and Galaxy Formation Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth histories for individual galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z&gt;7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.</description>

      <title>The HST-Hyperion Survey: Environmental Imprints on the Stellar-Mass Function at z=2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not all galaxies at Cosmic Noon evolve in the same way. It remains unclear how the local environment -- especially the extreme overdensities of protoclusters -- affects stellar mass assembly at high redshift. The stellar mass function (SMF) encodes these processes; comparing SMFs across environments reveals differences in evolutionary history. We present the SMF of the Hyperion proto-supercluster at $z\sim2.5$, one of the largest and most massive protostructures known. This dataset provides the most statistically robust SMF of a single protostructure at $z&gt;2$. By comparing the SMF of overdense peaks within Hyperion to the coeval field, we ask: how early, and how strongly, does a dense environment favor massive galaxies? Using COSMOS2020 photometry with ground-based and new HST grism spectroscopy, we construct a 3D overdensity map that assigns galaxies to peaks, outskirts, or the field. We perform 100 Monte Carlo realizations to propagate redshift and mass uncertainties, and derive SMFs normalized to the field. The peaks show a clear excess of massive galaxies: number densities at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 11$ are ~10x higher than the field, while those at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 9.5$ are enhanced by only ~3.5x. By contrast, the outskirts and Hyperion as a whole mirror the field. Environmental effects on stellar mass growth are thus evident by $z\sim 2.5$. The densest regions already host galaxies with accelerated growth, while the global SMF masks this signal. Protostructures therefore begin shaping the high-mass end of the SMF well before cluster quenching, and may drive the elevated star formation at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting galaxy properties from astronomical surveys relies heavily on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, yet uncertainties in key model ingredients are often overlooked. By leveraging a $z\sim0$ galaxy sample from the EAGLE simulation, we generate synthetic SDSS spectral and VISTA photometric observations with controlled assumptions, to assess how variations in stellar spectral library, initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity prescriptions within the BPASS-framework affect inferred galaxy properties. Our analysis combines spectral fitting from 3800 to 9200 A with photometric constraints extending to 2.3 $\mu$m, enabling robust assessment across a broad wavelength baseline. Our findings reveal mass, age and star formation rate vary by $0.27\pm0.09$, $0.19\pm0.11$ and $1.4\pm1.0$ dex, respectively, greater than observational uncertainties reported in surveys. Notably, we find stellar spectral library choice is capable of transforming a galaxy from appearing star-forming to quiescent, while a fixed metallicity assumption yields systematic biases when the chosen metallicity is incorrect. These modelling differences impact the reconstructed total mass assembly history in galaxies by up to $\sim12$ percent and bias the demographic and star formation history conclusions drawn from surveys. As upcoming missions like Euclid, Roman and CASTOR aim to characterise galaxy evolution with unprecedented precision, our results highlight the need for careful propagation of SED modelling uncertainties and transparency in model selection.</description>

      <title>Dust stripping in cluster galaxies: a PRIMA perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of galaxies in rich environments such as clusters and groups can be significantly perturbed during their interaction with nearby companions (tidal interactions) or with the hot intracluster medium (ICM) trapped within the gravitational potential well of the massive host halo (ram pressure stripping). Both gravitational perturbations and the external pressure exerted by the hot ICM on the galaxy ISM during its high velocity journey within the cluster are able to remove most, if not all of it, producing extended tails of stripped material. Along with the different gas phases (cold atomic and molecular, ionised, hot), these perturbations can remove also dust, thus contributing to the pollution of the ICM. Probe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is offering a unique opportunity to observe this dust component, a crucial ingredient in the energetic balance of the stripped gas. We analyse how the two instruments onboard of PRIMA, PRIMAger (in imaging and polarimetric mode) and far-IR enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS), can be used to observe a selected sample of ram pressure stripped tails detected at other frequencies (HI, CO, Halpha, X-rays). These data can be used to determine the relative distribution of the dust component with respect to that of the other gas phases, derive its temperature, calculate different gas physical parameters (electron density, photoelectric heating efficiency, gas metallicity), and quantify the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields, all fundamental parameters used to constrain the most recent hydrodynamic simulations of gas stripping in clusters. The ultimate aim of this research is that of understanding the fate of the cold stripped material once mixed with the surrounding hot medium and study under which condition it can collapse into giant molecular clouds (GMC) to form new stars.</description>

      <title>Transforming galaxies with EASE: widespread structural changes enabled by short-lived spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a population of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon ($1&lt;z&lt;3$) - can be explained with EASE: Early, Accelerated, Secular Evolution. The mechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type galaxies that are present and active at $z&gt;1.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes (heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\approx10-30$) orbital periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields, show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open, transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals in star-forming galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$ across the redshifts where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Low radio frequency detections of known pulsars and identification of new candidates with GLEAM-X: GP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based searches have become a complementary approach for identifying pulsars, particularly at MHz frequencies where scattering and high dispersion measures affect high-time resolution observations. In this work, we searched the Galactic Plane (GP) data release from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, a widefield continuum radio survey covering the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range, at the positions of known pulsars in the ATNF catalogue (version 2.6.2) that lie within its sky coverage. We present the spectral energy distribution for 193 known pulsars located at |b| &lt; 11deg. Notably, 106 of these represent the first detections below 400 MHz. We also cross-match the GLEAM-X: GP compact source catalogue with unassociated sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalogue, filtering for gamma-ray spectral and variability properties, as well as coincidence with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We have identified 106 possible pulsar candidates. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive, low-frequency Galactic plane surveys for detecting emission from known pulsars and presents a potential way of searching for new pulsar candidates that would otherwise be missed by traditional time-domain searches.</description>

      <title>Extended and Compact Ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ Structures Close to the Moment of Star-Formation: Evidence from ALMA-ACA Observations in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing and characterizing pre- and protostellar cores in the earliest and densest stages of star formation is challenging due to their short timescales and high densities, limiting the suitable tracers and targets. We conducted ALMA-Atacama Compact Array (ACA) stand-alone observations of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ (1$_{\rm 1,0}$-1$_{\rm 1,1}$) emission, which is believed to trace cold high-density regions, toward three dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud: (1) L1544, likely in the densest prestellar phase; (2) MC 35-mm, a candidate for the first hydrostatic core; and (3) MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 very-low luminosity object. These observations provide high angular resolution data for the line across a set of cores selected to represent consecutive stages around the onset of star formation, offering a unique opportunity to trace the time evolution of $\sim$10$^4$ years. With the single-dish total-power array, we detected ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ emission in all three cores, revealing its presence over scales of $\sim$10,000 au. In the interferometric 7 m array data with a beam size of 3.$''$5 ($\sim$500\,au), emission was detected only toward the central continuum source of MC 35-mm, with a significance of $\sim$3$\sigma$. No significant detections were found in the other targets, placing an upper limit on the H$_2$D$^{+}$ abundance of $\sim$10$^{-11}$ in the dense components traced by the interferometric continuum emission. These results suggest that ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ predominantly exhibits an extended distribution over several thousand au in the early stages of star formation. Detection in compact, dense central structures may only be achieved within a few $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years immediately before or after protostar formation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the supermassive black hole mass of NGC 7052 using high spatial resolution molecular gas observed with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our dynamical mass constraints on the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the early-type galaxy NGC 7052 using high spatial-resolution observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The data were obtained during ALMA Cycle 7 and have a synthesized beam size of 0''.29 $\times$ 0''.22 (97 $\times$ 73 pc$^2$). The dynamical model yielded an SMBH mass of $\approx (2.50 \pm 0.37 \, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.8 \, [{\rm systematic}]) \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ and a stellar-$I$ band mass-to-light ratio of $\approx 4.08 \pm 0.23\, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.4 \, [{\rm systematic}]$ M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$ ($3\sigma$ confidence intervals). Although our new ALMA observation has three times lower spatial resolution than previous ALMA data, it still resolves the SMBH's sphere of influence with a spatial resolution that is 1.5 times smaller than this sphere radius. While our $M_{\rm BH}$ estimate is fully consistent with the previous determination, the $I$-band mass-to-light ratio is lower by 10%. This difference arises from our improved galaxy mass model, which incorporates both the molecular gas distribution and the extended stellar mass in the outer regions of the galaxy, components that were previously neglected.</description>

      <title>A MUltiwavelength Study of ELAN Environments (AMUSE$^2$): The Impact of Dense Environment on Massive Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand how massive galaxies are influenced by their surroundings, we present new ALMA and NOEMA observations as part of A MUltiwavelength Study of ELAN Environments (AMUSE$^2$). These observations target submillimeter sources discovered in single-dish surveys around nine quasars hosting Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z=2\sim3$, including two Enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Through detection of mid-$J$ CO lines, we confirm physical associations of 15 SMGs, which are located outside the expected virial radii of the central dark-matter halos hosting the quasars. We find $73^{+29}_{-21}\%$ of SMGs have line profiles better described by double Gaussian models, with a median peak-to-peak separation of 350 $\pm$ 25 km/s, suggesting rotating disks or interacting pairs. Modified blackbody fits of the far-infrared photometry yield a median $\beta$ of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2 and $T_{dust}$ of 34 $\pm$ 3 K. Overall, SMGs outside quasar halos share similar physical properties with those in the field, but combining data from other studies reveals depleted gas fractions within quasar halos. This suggests that dense environments significantly impact massive star-forming galaxies only within halo scales at cosmic noon. Additionally, spatial analyses of 15 SMGs indicate they trace large-scale structures, possibly filamentary or elongated pancake-like, with a scale height of 2-5\,cMpc. Our measured distributions and densities of star-formation rates align with models, though likely represent lower limits.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Influence of supermassive primordial black holes on ultraviolet luminosity of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{6.3\text{-}8.3} M_\odot$, abundances $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-7}\text{-}10^{-5}$, and sub-Eddington ratios $\lambda_E \ll 1$ can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive catalogue of OB cluster candidates in M31 and their association with giant molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new catalogue of 578 OB cluster (OBC) candidates in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al. 2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry: clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across galactic discs.</description>

      <title>The slow evolution of dark matter halos from cusp to core naturally produces extended stellar core-like distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of extended stellar cores in dark matter (DM) dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter "beta" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.</description>

      <title>Tidally induced bar-like galaxies in simulated clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the scenarios for bar formation in galaxies involves their interaction with a more massive companion. The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages. In spite of difficulties in the interpretation of some cases involving mergers and multiple interactions, the results confirm in the cosmological context the reality of tidal bar formation in cluster environments previously studied using controlled simulations.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear in astrophysical clouds and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined effect of the density-stratified turbulence and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers causes the alpha effect and the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. This results in generation of the large-scale magnetic field in colliding protogalactic clouds, merging protostellar clouds and protoplanetary discs. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions caused by the inhomogeneity of turbulence to the $\alpha$ tensor and effective pumping velocity. The isotropic part of the alpha tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field caused by product of the fluid density stratification and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity due to collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. However, the alpha tensor is independent of the effects of collapsing or expanding of clouds.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.</description>

      <title>What Do Radio Emission Constraints Tell Us About Little Red Dots as Tidal Disruption Events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.</description>

      <title>Extending the simulations of intermediate-mass black hole mass measurements to Virgo Cluster using ELT/HARMONI high resolution integral-field stellar kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The firm co-existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^3-10^6 M_odot$) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) remains uncertain because the limited number of verified instances within the local Universe, limited within 3.5 Mpc. They are crucial for our understanding about the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) promises to revolutionize the detection of these mysterious objects. In this study, we simulated the kinematics of an IMBH within the nuclear star cluster of VCC 1861, one of the faintest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Using Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and stellar density profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and the HSIM program, we created mock High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral field spectrograph (HARMONI) observations for the ELT. We then extract stellar kinematics from these mock data and recover the BH mass using the JAM model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. Our results demonstrate the ELT's capability to detect IMBHs with masses comprising 5% of the NSC's mass at the distance of the Virgo Cluster.</description>

      <title>Meet the Neighbors: Gas Rich "Buddy Galaxies" are Common Around Recently Quenched Massive Galaxies in the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we characterize the environments of massive ($\log(M_\odot/M_\star)\sim11.2$) $z\sim0.7$ post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) by studying serendipitously-detected CO(2-1) emitters found in targeted observations of the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E sample. We report $31\pm6\%$ of the galaxies from this survey host nearby gas-rich ``buddies'' with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10},M_\odot$ and molecular gas comparable to their central PSBs ($M_{H_{2}} \sim 10^{10} M_\odot$), but $\sim0.8$ dex lower stellar mass ($\sim 10^{10.4} M_\odot$). Based on their location in position-velocity space, each buddy is consistent with being bound to the haloes of their SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E host galaxies. We compare to the UniverseMachine model and find that SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E galaxies host a typical number of neighbors for their stellar mass, suggesting that PSBs live in environments typical of co-eval similarly-massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>First detection of ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde in hot core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1: Tracing prebiotic oxygen chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethylene oxide (c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O) and its isomer, acetaldehyde (CH$_{3}$CHO), are important complex organic molecules owing to their potential role in the formation of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH) in ISM. The detection of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O in hot molecular cores suggests that the possible existence of larger ring-shaped molecules containing more than three carbon atoms, such as furan (c-C$_{4}$H$_{4}$O), which shares structural similarities with ribose (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$O5), the sugar component of DNA. In this study, we report the first detection of the rotational emission lines of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, based on observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 7. The fractional abundances of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO relative to H$_{2}$ are $(2.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-9}$ and $(7.1\pm0.9)\times10^{-9}$, respectively. The column density ratio between CH$_{3}$CHO and c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O is $3.4\pm0.7$. A Pearson correlation heat map reveals strong positive correlations ($r$ $&gt;$ 0.5) between the abundances and excitation temperatures of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO, suggesting a possible chemical connection between those two molecules. To investigate this further, we conducted a two-phase warm-up chemical model using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. A comparison between our derived abundances and the predictions from our chemical model and existence model demonstrates good agreement within factors of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. We propose that c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O may form in G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 via the grain surface reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ and O, but CH$_{3}$CHO may be produced through the surface reaction between CH$_{3}$ and HCO.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of the double Red Clump in the Milky Way Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reanalysis of the metallicity of the double red clump (RC) stars from the Milky Way bulge. Two leading explanations for the existence of the double RC concern possible differences in chemical composition (multiple populations of stars) or distance (X-shaped bulge). We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach. Our resulting difference between mean metallicity of the two RCs equals: $0.23^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ or $0.28^{+0.17}_{-0.18}~\mathrm{dex}$, if the red giant branch bump is included or not, respectively. Because of the high statistical error, the result does not confirm the multiple populations hypothesis.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: The stellar mass function of quiescent and star forming galaxies at 0.05 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies at z &lt;= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data release (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over 3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r &lt;= 20 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.20. Stellar masses and star formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting with CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as star-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR), adopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using the 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions. Results. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and agree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic mass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that of star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming galaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent fraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ &gt; 0.95 at log(M*/Msun) &gt; 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an excess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3 stellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the literature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models. Quiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) &gt; 9, but 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including 7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more accurate SED fitting and galaxy classification.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Clouds: S3 as the most distant extended Milky Way stream, not of LMC origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: While the LMC's influence on MW stellar streams has been extensively studied, streams associated with the Clouds have received far less attention. Beyond the Magellanic Stream, only four stream candidates (S1-S4) have been reported. Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\sim30^\circ$) and narrow ($\sim1.2^\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our goals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3 candidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members; and 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW or the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network classifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through a cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve stream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby accounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify 1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's apparent width has grown from $\sim1.2^\circ$ to $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ compared to previous studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars, which are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their well-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both modelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity with the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from the LMC, instead representing a distant ($\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions: S3 is the most distant ($\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\sim30^\circ$ long, $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer halo and the LMC's recent influence. Its angular width corresponds to a physical thickness of $\sim4$-5 kpc, making S3 among the thickest streams discovered.</description>

      <title>VLA FRAMEx. III. Circumnuclear Radio Emission Mechanisms in Hard X-ray Selected Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Stokes I continuum analysis for a volume-limited sample ($&lt;40~\rm{Mpc}$) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using $4-12$ GHz observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Controlled Transport of GeV Cosmic Rays in Diverse Galactic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transport of GeV cosmic rays (CRs) in a set of high-resolution TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). Our local disk patch models sample a wide range of gas surface densities, gravitational potentials, and star formation rates (SFRs), and include a spiral arm simulation. Our approach incorporates CR advection by the background gas, streaming along the magnetic field limited by the local ion Alfv\'en speed, and diffusion relative to the Alfv\'en wave frame, with the diffusion coefficient set by the balance between streaming-driven Alfv\'en wave excitation and damping mediated by local gas properties. We find that dynamical transport mechanisms (streaming and advection) are almost solely responsible for GeV CR transport in the extra-planar regions of galaxies, while diffusion along the magnetic field dominates within the primarily-neutral ISM of galactic disks. We develop a simple 1D predictive model for the CR pressure $P_\mathrm{c}$, dependent only on injected CR flux and gas parameters. We demonstrate that the CR transport efficiency increases with increasing SFR, and provide a fit for the CR feedback yield $\Upsilon_\mathrm{c}~\equiv~P_\mathrm{c}/\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ as a function of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, the SFR surface density. We analyze lateral CR transport within the galactic disk, showing that CRs propagate away from feedback regions in spiral arms into interarm regions by a combination of gas advection and field-aligned transport. Lastly, we develop an empirical subgrid model for the CR scattering rate that captures the impacts of the multiphase ISM on CR transport without the numerical burden of full simulations.</description>

      <title>The hyperbolically symmetric black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe some properties of the hyperbolically symmetric black hole (hereafter referred to as the $HSBH$) proposed a few years ago. We start by explaining the main motivation behind such an idea, and we determine the main differences between this scenario and the classical black hole (hereafter referred to as the $CBH$) scenario. Particularly important are the facts that, in the $HSBH$ scenario, (i) test particles in the region inside the horizon experience a repulsive force that prevents them from reaching the center, (ii) test particles may cross the horizon outward only along the symmetry axis, and (iii) the spacetime within the horizon is static but not spherically symmetric. Next, we examine the differences between the two models of black holes in light of the Landauer principle and the Hawking results on the eventual evaporation of the black hole and the paradox resulting thereof. Finally, we explore what observational signature could be invoked to confirm or dismiss the model.</description>

Abstract: A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.</description>

      <title>Probing Thin Winds in Massive OB Stars of the SMC with JWST/NIRSPEC Br-alpha Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass loss is a key physical process in the evolution of massive stars, the impact of which propagates into galactic evolution, population synthesis models, the interpretation of high-redshift galaxies, and explosive events such as supernovae. However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Quasi-Hierarchical Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational dynamics of quasi-hierarchical triple systems, where the outer orbital period is significantly longer than the inner one, but the outer orbit is extremely eccentric, rendering the time at pericentre comparable to the inner period. Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>The oldest Milky Way stars: New constraints on the age of the Universe and the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the most robust, old, and cosmology-independent age estimates of individual stars from Gaia DR3 to place a lower bound on the age of the Universe, $t_U$. These constraints can serve as an anchor point for any cosmological model, providing an upper limit to the Hubble constant $H_0$. We consider the stellar age catalog of arXiv:2402.00561, selecting 3,000 of the oldest and most robustly measured main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and subgiant branch (SGB) stars, with ages $&gt;12.5$ Gyr and associated error $&lt;1$ Gyr. Ages are derived via isochrone fitting using the Bayesian code StarHorse, spanning the uniform range 0-20 Gyr, not assuming any cosmological prior on $t_U$. With a conservative cut in the Kiel diagram, strict quality cuts both on stellar parameters and posterior shapes, and removing potential contaminants, we isolate a final sample of 160 bona-fide stars, representing the largest sample of precise and reliable MSTO and SGB stars ages available to date. The age distribution of the final sample peaks at $13.6 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Assuming a maximum formation redshift for these stars of $z_f = 20$ (a formation delay of $\sim$0.2 Gyr), we obtain a lower bound on $t_U$ of $t_U \geq 13.8 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Considering the $10^{th}$ percentile of each star's posterior distributions, we find that, at 90% CL (stat), 70 stars favour $t_U &gt; 13$ Gyr, while none exceeds 14.1 Gyr. An oldest age younger than 13 Gyr for this sample is incompatible with the data, even considering the full systematic error budget. This work presents the first statistically significant use of individual stellar ages as cosmic clocks, opening a new, independent approach for cosmological studies. While this already represents a major step forward, future Gaia data releases will yield even larger and more precise stellar samples, further strengthening these constraints.</description>

      <title>Updated bounds on ultra-light dark matter from the tiniest galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m &gt; 3 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the "fuzzy" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m &gt; 8 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations.</description>

      <title>Counterpart identification and classification for eRASS1 and characterisation of the AGN content</title>

Abstract: [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.</description>

      <title>Double White Dwarf Binaries in SDSS-V DR19 : A catalog of DA white dwarf binaries and constraints on the binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) includes the first large-scale spectroscopic survey of white dwarfs (WDs) in the era of Gaia parallaxes. SDSS-V collects multiple exposures per target, making it ideal for binary detection. We present a search for hydrogen atmosphere (DA) double white dwarf (DWD) binaries in this rich dataset. We quantify radial velocity variations between sub-exposures to identify binary candidates, and also measure the orbital period for a subset of DWD binary candidates. We find 63 DWD binary candidates, of which 43 are new discoveries, and we provide tentative periods for 10 binary systems. Using these measurements, we place constraints on the binary fraction of the Galactic WD population with $&lt; 0.4$ AU separations $f_{\mathrm{bin,0.4}} = 9\%$, and the power-law index of the initial separation distribution $\alpha = -0.62$. Using the simulated binary population, we estimate that $\leq 10$ super-Chandrasekhar binaries that merge within a Hubble time are expected in our sample. We predict that $\leq 5$ systems in our sample should be detectable via gravitational waves by LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of which has already been identified as a LISA verification source. We also estimate a total of about 10,000 - 20,000 LISA-detectable DWD binaries in the galaxy. Our catalog of WD+WD binary candidates in SDSS-V is now public, and promises to uncover a large number of exciting DWD systems.</description>

      <title>J-VAR: Analysis of RR Lyrae light curves in seven optical bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. RR Lyrae stars are key distance indicators and tracers of old stellar populations in the Milky Way and its satellites. Accurate period and amplitude measurements are essential for constraining stellar evolution and mapping Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey provides valuable time-series data across seven optical bands, including gri and four medium and narrow bands. Aims. Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the first data release (DR1) of the J-VAR survey using the Gaia DR3 variable stars catalog as a reference. Methods. The light curves of 315 RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multiband template library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results. The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with Gaia DR3 values, which confirms the reliability of the applied methodology. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter reveals the expected trend for RRab and RRc stars, with larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. After normalizing by the r-band amplitude, an exponential trend is found, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at 395 nm having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at 861 nm. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions. The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from 395 to 860 nm and offering a unique benchmark for theoretical models.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation modelling of the observed UV/optical power spectra of quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a significant amount of effort has been put into investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$\AA\ up to $4000$\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.</description>

      <title>Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

      <title>Crowning the Queen: Membership, Age, Rotation, and Activity for the Open Cluster Coma Berenices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being only 85 pc away, the open cluster Coma Berenices (Coma Ber) has not been extensively studied. This is due in part to its sparseness and low proper motion, which together made Coma Ber's membership challenging to establish. Gaia data for $\approx$400 previously cataloged candidate cluster stars allowed us to identify $\approx$300 as members. With [Fe/H] measurements for nine members, we found that Coma Ber has a solar metallicity, and then fit isochrones to its color--magnitude diagram to determine that it is 675$\pm$100 Myr old. With photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we measured rotation periods for 137 of Coma Ber's low-mass stars, increasing the sample of members with measured periods by a factor of six, and extending the rotational census for the cluster from its late F stars through to its fully convective M dwarfs. By measuring the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line for $\approx$250 stars and collecting X-ray detections for $\approx$100 ($\approx$85% and $\approx$33% of the cluster's members, respectively), we characterized magnetic activity in Coma Ber and examined the dependence of chromospheric and of coronal activity on rotation in these stars. Despite having a metallicity that is 0.2 dex below that of their coeval cousins in Praesepe and the Hyades, low-mass stars in Coma Ber seem to follow a similar rotation--activity relation. In detail, however, there are differences that may provide further insight into the impact of metallicity on this still poorly understood relation.</description>

Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at a spectral resolution of R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.4\substack{+3.1\\-1.0})\times10^9 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio of $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}=0.3\substack{+0.6\\-0.2}$, as implied from the broad Balmer H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. The quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity $6050\substack{+460\\-630}$ km/s and ionised outflow rate of $1650\substack{+130\\-1230}M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. This is possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveal that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with a luminosity-weighted stellar age of $65\substack{+9\\-4}$ Myr, stellar mass of $(3.6\substack{+0.6\\-0.3})\times10^{11} M_\odot$, and star-formation rate (SFR) of ~15-30 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with a stellar age of $6.7\pm1.8$ Myr, stellar mass of $(1.9\pm0.4)\times10^{10} M_\odot$, and SFR of ~40-65 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. There is also another galaxy in the field, likely in the foreground at z=1.135, which could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification $1&lt;\mu&lt;2$, and, thus, &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a 'train-wreck' merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.</description>

      <title>DELVE-DEEP Survey: The Faint Satellite System of NGC 55</title>

Abstract: We report the first comprehensive census of the satellite dwarf galaxies around NGC 55 ($2.1$ Mpc) as a part of the DECam Local Volume Exploration DEEP (DELVE-DEEP) survey. NGC 55 is one of four isolated, Magellanic analogs in the Local Volume around which DELVE-DEEP aims to identify faint dwarfs and other substructures. We employ two complementary detection methods: one targets fully resolved dwarf galaxies by identifying them as stellar over-densities, while the other focuses on semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, detecting them through shredded unresolved light components. As shown through extensive tests with injected galaxies, our search is sensitive to candidates down to $M_V \lesssim -6.6$ and surface brightness $\mu \lesssim 28.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and $\sim 80\%$ complete down to $M_V \lesssim -7.8$. We do not report any new confirmed satellites beyond two previously known systems, ESO 294-010 and NGC 55-dw1. We construct the satellite luminosity function of NGC 55 and find it to be consistent with the predictions from cosmological simulations. As one of the first complete luminosity functions for a Magellanic analog, our results provide a glimpse of the constraints on low-mass-host satellite populations that will be further explored by upcoming surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Investigation of mass substructure in gravitational lens system SDP.81 with ALMA long-baseline observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence and properties of low-mass dark matter haloes serve as a crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs. Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: Constraints on AGN Feedback in Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of AGN feedback, on the entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of galaxy groups detected in the SRG/eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) to shed light on the characteristics of the feedback mechanisms. We analyze deeper eROSITA observations of 1178 galaxy groups detected in eRASS1. We divide the sample into 271 subsamples and extract average thermodynamic properties, including electron density, temperature, and entropy at three characteristic radii along with the integrated temperature by jointly analyzing X-ray images and spectra following a Bayesian approach. We present the tightest constraints on the impact of AGN feedback through our average entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of the largest group sample used in X-ray studies, incorporating major systematics in our analysis. We find that entropy shows an increasing trend with temperature in the form of a power-law-like relation at the higher intra-group medium temperatures, while for the low mass groups, a slight flattening is observed on the average entropy. Overall, the observed entropy measurements agree well with the earlier measurements in the literature. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (MillenniumTNG, Magneticum, OWL simulations) after the applications of the selection function calibrated for our galaxy groups reveal that observed entropy profiles in the cores are below the predictions of simulations. At the mid-region, the entropy measurements agree well with the Magneticum simulations, whereas the predictions of MillenniumTNG and OWL simulations fall below observations. At the outskirts, the overall agreement between the observations and simulations improves, with Magneticum simulations reproducing the observations the best. Our measurements will pave the way for more realistic AGN feedback implementations in simulations.</description>

      <title>GalaxAlign: Mimicking Citizen Scientists' Multimodal Guidance for Galaxy Morphology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology analysis involves studying galaxies based on their shapes and structures. For such studies, fundamental tasks include identifying and classifying galaxies in astronomical images, as well as retrieving visually or structurally similar galaxies through similarity search. Existing methods either directly train domain-specific foundation models on large, annotated datasets or fine-tune vision foundation models on a smaller set of images. The former is effective but costly, while the latter is more resource-efficient but often yields lower accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce GalaxAlign, a multimodal approach inspired by how citizen scientists identify galaxies in astronomical images by following textual descriptions and matching schematic symbols. Specifically, GalaxAlign employs a tri-modal alignment framework to align three types of data during fine-tuning: (1) schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels for these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. By incorporating multimodal instructions, GalaxAlign eliminates the need for expensive pretraining and enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>10,000 Resolved Triples from Gaia: Empirical Constraints on Triple Star Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope $-1.4$; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint different parsec-scale features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows to determine the position of a point close to the source's brightest compact detail at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical explanations for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory: The Nature of the Astrophysical r-process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>
