      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Markowitz's (1952) decomposition of a portfolio variance as a quadratic form in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities, which has been the core of classical portfolio theory for more than 70 years, is valid only in the approximation when all trade volumes with all securities of the portfolio are assumed constant. We derive the market-based portfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for the impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we transform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio and obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and variances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means and variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based variance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the structure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single security. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of prices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the developers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of random markets.</description>

      <title>An extended Merton problem with relaxed benchmark tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a Merton's optimal portfolio and consumption problem in an extended formulation by incorporating the benchmark tracking on the wealth process. We consider a tracking formulation such that the wealth process compensated by a fictitious capital injection outperforms the benchmark at all times. The fund manager aims to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection, where the latter term can also be interpreted as the expected largest shortfall of the wealth with reference to the benchmark. By considering an auxiliary state process, we formulate an equivalent stochastic control problem with state reflections at zero. For general utility functions and It\^o diffusion benchmark process, we develop a convex duality theorem, new to the literature, to the auxiliary stochastic control problem with state reflections in which the dual process also exhibits reflections from above. For CRRA utility and geometric Brownian motion benchmark process, we further derive the optimal portfolio and consumption in feedback form using the new duality theorem, allowing us to discuss some interesting financial implications induced by the additional risk-taking from the capital injection and the goal of tracking.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Investment-Driven Insurance Pricing and Optimal Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the equilibrium of insurance market in a dynamic setting, focusing on the interaction between insurers' underwriting and investment strategies. Three possible equilibrium outcomes are identified: a positive insurance market, a zero insurance market, and market failure. Our findings reveal why insurers may rationally accept underwriting losses by setting a negative safety loading while relying on investment profits, particularly when there is a negative correlation between insurance gains and financial returns. Additionally, we explore the impact of regulatory frictions, showing that while imposing a cost on investment can enhance social welfare under certain conditions, it may not always be necessary.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMS for Top-Down Sector Allocation In Automated Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09647v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</description>
