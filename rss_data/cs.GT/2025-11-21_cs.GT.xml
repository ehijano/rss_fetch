      <title>Prior-free Collusion-proof Dynamic Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a general class of dynamic stochastic multi-player problems, Cs\'oka, Liu, Rodivilov, and Teytelboym (2024) proposed prior-dependent mechanisms. The Guaranteed Utility Mechanism with transfers (TU-GUM) implements efficiency in a Guaranteed Utility Equilibrium (GUE). Its transfer-free variant (NTU-GUM) implements approximate efficiency in {\epsilon}-GUE. In this paper, we define prior-free versions of both TU-GUM and NTU-GUM. As a special case, we believe that the new prior-free NTU-GUM implements a 1.283-approximation to Pareto efficiency for the repeated single good allocation problem in Fikioris, Banerjee, and Tardos (2024).</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Computing the Nucleolus: An Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Maggiorano et al. (2025) claimed that they have developed a strongly polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for the nucleolus in convex games that is based on the reduced game approach and submodular function minimization method. Thereby, avoiding the ellipsoid method with its negative side effects in numerical computation completely. However, we shall argue that this is a fallacy based on an incorrect application of the Davis/Maschler reduced game property (RGP). Ignoring the fact that despite the pre-nucleolus, other solutions like the core, pre-kernel, and semi-reactive pre-bargaining set possess this property as well. This causes a severe selection issue, leading to the failure to compute the nucleolus of convex games using the reduced games approach. In order to assess this finding in its context, the ellipsoid method of Faigle et al. (2001) and the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation-based approach from convex analysis of Meinhardt (2013) to compute a pre-kernel element were resumed. In the latter case, it was exploited that for TU games with a single-valued pre-kernel, both solution concepts coincide. Implying that one has computed the pre-nucleolus if one has found the sole pre-kernel element of the game. Though it is a specialized and highly optimized algorithm for the pre-kernel, it assures runtime complexity of O(n^3) for computing the pre-nucleolus whenever the pre-kernel is a single point, which indicates a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of games.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Online Inventory Balancing to Inventory Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm.
  Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making for Goods with Perishable Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decentralized markets for goods whose utility perishes in time, with compute as a primary motivation. Recent advances in reproducible and verifiable execution allow jobs to pause, verify, and resume across heterogeneous hardware, which allow us to treat compute as time indexed capacity rather than bespoke bundles. We design an automated market maker (AMM) that posts an hourly price as a concave function of load--the ratio of current demand to a "floor supply" (providers willing to work at a preset floor). This mechanism decouples price discovery from allocation and yields transparent, low latency trading. We establish existence and uniqueness of equilibrium quotes and give conditions under which the equilibrium is admissible (i.e. active supply weakly exceeds demand). To align incentives, we pair a premium sharing pool (base cost plus a pro rata share of contemporaneous surplus) with a Cheapest Feasible Matching (CFM) rule; under mild assumptions, providers optimally stake early and fully while truthfully report costs. Despite being simple and computationally efficient, we show that CFM attains bounded worst case regret relative to an optimal benchmark.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIS Algorithms for Rational Agents using Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in distributed networks where each node is a rational agent whose payoff depends on whether it joins the MIS. Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.
  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.
  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability.</description>

      <title>The Publication Choice Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers strategically choose where to submit their work in order to maximize its impact, and these publication decisions in turn determine venues' impact factors. To analyze how individual publication choices both respond to and shape venue impact, we introduce a game-theoretic framework, coined the Publication Choice Problem, that captures this two-way interplay. We show the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the Publication Choice Problem and its uniqueness under binary researcher types. Our characterizations of the equilibrium properties offer insights about what publication behaviors better indicate a researcher's impact level. Through equilibrium analysis, we further investigate how labeling papers with ``spotlight'' affects the impact factor of venues in the research community. Our analysis shows that competitive venue labeling top papers with ``spotlight'' may decrease the overall impact of other venues in the community, while less competitive venues with ``spotlight'' labeling have the opposite impact.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Replace Economic Choice Prediction Labs? The Case of Language-based Persuasion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17435v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data. Beyond data generation, we investigate the dual role of LLMs as both data generators and predictors, introducing a comprehensive empirical study on the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs for data generation, human choice prediction, or both. We then utilize our choice prediction framework to analyze how strategic factors shape decision-making, showing that interaction history (rather than linguistic sentiment alone) plays a key role in predicting human decision-making in repeated interactions. Particularly, when LLMs capture history-dependent decision patterns similarly to humans, their predictive success improves substantially. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our findings across alternative persuasion-game settings, highlighting the broader potential of using LLM-generated data to model human decision-making.</description>
