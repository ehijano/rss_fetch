      <title>Hausdorff measure of cartesian product of Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension are useful tools to describe fractals. This paper investigates the bounds on the $d\log_32$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the $d$-fold Cartesian product of the $1/3$ Cantor set, $\mathcal C^d$. By applying known theorems on the Hausdorff measure of fractals satisfying the strong open set condition and generalizing what has been done on $\mathcal C^2$, we compute stricter upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff measure of $\mathcal C^d$ for several small integers $d$.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'{a}n and Delsarte problems and their duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two optimization problems for positive definite functions on Euclidean space with restrictions on their support and sign: the Turan problem and the Delsarte problem. These problems have been studied also for their connections to geometric problems of tiling and packing. In the finite group setting the weak and strong linear duality for these problems are automatic. We prove these properties in the continuous setting. We also show the existence of extremizers for these problems and their duals, and establish tiling-type relations between the extremal functions for each problem and the extremal measures or distributions for the dual problem. We then apply the results to convex bodies, and prove that the Delsarte packing bound is strictly better than the trivial volume packing bound for every convex body that does not tile the space.</description>

      <title>Approximating the coefficients of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Curves in Semipositone Problems with Geometrically Concave and Concave Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the exact multiplicity and bifurcation curves of positive solutions for the semipositone problem defined on the interval from minus one to one, with zero boundary conditions at both ends. The function f is twice continuously differentiable on the positive real line, and there exist two positive numbers such that f is positive between them and negative outside this range. We allow f at zero from the right to be negative infinity and provide many examples to illustrate these results. Furthermore, our results also yield the main theorems presented in previous references. Additionally, some earlier authors claimed to have resolved this issue under certain conditions, but we find that their proof is incorrect. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate the correctness of their conclusion.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a special family of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle (OPUC). These OPUC satisfy a mirror symmetry property of their Verblunsky coefficients. Several equivalent conditions for the OPUC to be mirror symmetric are presented. Corresponding unitary CMV matrices satisfy simple algebraic relations similar to relations for persymmetric tridiagonal matrices. We present three explicit examples of mirror symmetric OPUC.</description>

      <title>Inequalities, identities, and bounds for divided differences of the exponential function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\exp[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n]$ denote the divided difference of the exponential function.
  (i) We prove that exponential divided differences are log-submodular.
  (ii) We establish the four-point inequality $ \exp[a,a,b,c]\,\exp[d,d,b,c]+\exp[b,b,a,d]\,\exp[c,c,a,d]-\exp[a,b,c,d]^2 \ge 0 $ for all $ a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R} $.
  (iii) We obtain sharp two-sided bounds for $\exp[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ at fixed mean and variance; as a consequence, we derive their large-input asymptotics.
  (iv) We present closed-form identities for divided differences of the exponential function, including a convolution identity and summation formulas for repeated arguments.</description>

      <title>Strong exceptional parameters for the dimension of nonlinear slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1 \leq m &lt; s \leq n$ and let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a Borel set of with $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^s(A) &gt; 0$. The classical Marstrand slicing theorem states that, for almost every $m$-dimensional subspace $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive-measure set of $x \in V$ such that $x + V^\perp$ intersects $A$ in a set of Hausdorff dimension $s-m$. We prove a strong and quantitative version of Marstrand's slicing theorem in the Peres-Schlag framework. In particular, if $(\Pi_\lambda: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m)_{\lambda \in U}$ is a family of generalized projections that satisfies the transversality and strong regularity conditions of degree $0$, then for every $A \subseteq \Omega$ with $\mathcal{H}^s(A) &gt; 0$, the set of $\lambda$ in the parameter space $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $\dim\!\big(A \cap \Pi_\lambda^{-1}(x)\big) &lt; s-m$ for a.e. $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$ has Hausdorff dimension at most $N + m - s$. If moreover $\mathcal{H}^s(A) &lt; \infty$, then this exceptional set is universal for the subsets of $A$ with positive $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure in the sense that this same collection of parameters contains the corresponding exceptional sets of all those subsets of $A$. When $(\Pi_\lambda)_{\lambda \in U}$ is only transversal and strongly regular of some sufficiently small order $\beta &gt; 0$, a similar conclusion holds modulo an error term of order $\beta^{1/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp continuum Beck-type theorem for hyperplanes. Our work is inspired by foundational work of Beck on the discrete problem, as well as refinements due to Do and Lund. The inductive proof uses recent breakthrough results in projection theory by Orponen--Shmerkin--Wang and Ren, who proved continuum Beck-type theorems for lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose global surjectivity theorems of differentiable maps based on second order conditions. Using the homotopy continuation method, we demonstrate that, for a $C^2$ differentiable map from a Hilbert space to a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, when its second-order differential has uniform upper and lower bounds, it has a global path-lifting property in the presence of singularities. This is then applied to the nonlinear motion planning problem, establishing in some cases the well-posedness of the continuation method despite critical values of the endpoint maps.</description>

      <title>Properties of generalized Jacobi elliptic functions with three parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi elliptic functions and complete elliptic integrals are generalized using three parameters. These generalized functions and integrals are closely related to ordinary differential equations involving $p$-Laplacian. In this paper, Wallis-type integral formulae are constructed for the generalized Jacobi elliptic functions. Moreover, for the generalized complete elliptic integrals, a Legendre-type relation is derived, which is equivalent to Elliott's identity for Gaussian hypergeometric series, along with its implications. In addition, nontrivial inequalities on binomial expansions of generalized Jacobi elliptic functions are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every completely monotone function defined on a right-unbounded open interval admits a Newton series expansion at every point of that interval. This result can be viewed as an analog of Bernstein's little theorem for absolutely monotone functions. As an application, we use it to study principal indefinite sums, which are constructed via a broad generalization of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem.</description>

      <title>The information content of points on lines and $k$-plane extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound on the algorithmic information content of points lying on a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely, we show that a typical point $z$ on any line $\ell$ satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
  K_r(z)\geq \frac{K_r(\ell)}{2} + r - o(r)
  \end{equation*}
  at every precision $r$. In other words, a randomly chosen point on a line has (at least) half of the complexity of the line plus the complexity of its first coordinate. We apply this effective result to establish a classical bound on how much the Hausdorff dimension of a union of positive measure subsets of $k$-planes can increase when each subset is replaced with the entire $k$-plane. To prove the complexity bound, we modify a recent idea of Cholak-Cs\"ornyei-Lutz-Lutz-Mayordomo-Stull.</description>

      <title>Kronecker second limit formula for real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the second Kronecker ``limit" formula for a real quadratic field is established for the first time. More precisely, we obtain the second Kronecker limit formula of Zagier's zeta function. Using the reduction theory of Zagier, which connects Zagier's zeta function to the zeta function of real quadratic fields, we express the values of the zeta function of narrow ideal classes in real quadratic fields at natural arguments in terms of an analytic function which we call the \emph{higher Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function} and denote it by $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$. This function plays a central role in our study. The function $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ possesses elegant properties, for example, we prove that it satisfies the two, three and six-term functional equations. As a result of our Kronecker limit formula and functional equations, we provide another expression for the combinations of zeta values. Finally, we interpret our Kronecker ``limit" formula in terms of cohomological relations and establish a connection between $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ and a generalized Dedekind-eta function.</description>

      <title>A proof of Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture for WRT invariants of Seifert fibered homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a general Seifert fibered integral homology $3$-sphere with $r\ge3$ exceptional fibers. For every root of unity $\zeta\not=1$, we show that the SU(2) WRT invariant of $X$ evaluated at $\zeta$ is (up to an elementary factor) the non-tangential limit at $\zeta$ of the GPPV invariant of $X$, thereby generalizing a result from [Andersen-Mistegard 2022]. Based on this result, we apply the quantum modularity results developed in [Han-Li-Sauzin-Sun 2023] to the GPPV invariant of $X$ to prove Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture [Witten 1989] for the WRT invariant of $X$. We also prove that the GPPV invariant of $X$ induces a higher depth strong quantum modular form. Moreover, when suitably normalized, the GPPV invariant provides an ``analytic incarnation'' of the Habiro invariant.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Macdonald's Jack Hypergeometric Series ${}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ via Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a widely circulated manuscript from the 1980s, now available on the arXiv, I.~G.~Macdonald introduced certain multivariable hypergeometric series ${}_pF_q(x)= {}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y)= {}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ in one and two sets of variables $x=(x_1,\dots x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots y_n)$. These two series are defined by explicit expansions in terms of Jack polynomials $J^{(\alpha)}_\lambda$, and for $\alpha=2$ they specialize to the hypergeometric series of matrix arguments studied by Herz (1955) and Constantine (1963) that admit analogous expansions in terms of zonal polynomials.
  In this paper we determine explicit partial differential equations that characterize ${}_pF_q$, thereby answering a question posed by Macdonald. More precisely, for each $n,p,q$ we construct three differential operators $\mathcal A=\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\mathcal B=\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $\mathcal C=C^{(x)}$, and we show that ${}_pF_q(x,y)$ and ${}_pF_q(x)$ are the unique series solutions of the equations $\mathcal A(f)=0$ and $\mathcal C(f)=0$, respectively, subject to certain symmetry and boundary conditions. We also prove that the equation $\mathcal B(f)=0$ characterizes ${}_pF_q(x)$, but only after one restricts the domain of $\mathcal B$ to the set of series satisfying an additional stability condition with respect to $n$.
  Special cases of the operators $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ have been constructed previously in the literature, but only for a small number of pairs $(p,q)$, namely for $p \leq 3$ and $q \leq 2$ in the zonal case by Muirhead (1970), Constantine--Muirhead (1972), and Fujikoshi (1975); and for $p \leq 2$ and $q \leq 1$ in the general Jack case by Macdonald (1980s), Yan (1992), Kaneko (1993), and Baker--Forrester (1997). However the operator $\mathcal C$ seems to be new even for these special cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional interaction energy $\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}(W*\rho)(x)d\rho(x) + \int_{\mathbb{R}}U(x)d\rho(x)$ where the interaction potential $W(x)= -\frac{|x|^b}{b},\,1\le b \le 2$ and the external potential $U(x)=\frac{|x|^4}{4}$, and $\rho$ is a compactly supported probability measure on the real line. Our main result shows that the minimizer is supported on two intervals when $1&lt;b&lt;2$, showing in particular how the support of the minimizer transits from an interval (when $b=1$) to two points (when $b=2$) as $b$ increases. As a crucial part of the proof, we develop a new version of the iterated balayage algorithm, the original version of which was designed by Benko, Damelin, Dragnev and Kuijlaars for logarithmic potentials in one dimension. We expect the methodology in this paper can be generalized to study minimizers of interaction energies in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose support is possibly an annulus.</description>

      <title>A sharp weighted Fourier extension estimate for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ based on circle tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply recent circle tangency estimates due to Pramanik--Yang--Zahl to prove sharp weighted Fourier extension estimates for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $1$-dimensional weights. The idea of using circle tangency estimates to study Fourier extension of the cone is originally due to Tom Wolff, who used it in part to prove the first decoupling estimates. We make an improvement to the best known Mizohata--Takeuchi-type estimates for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the $1$-dimensional weights as a corollary of our main theorem, where the previously best known bound follows as a corollary of refined decoupling estimates.</description>

      <title>Tangency counting for well-spaced circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the late 90's, Tom Wolff introduced the circle tangency counting problem in his expository article on the Kakeya conjecture. For collections of well-spaced circles, we break the $N^{3/2}$-barrier, proving that a set of $N$ well-spaced circles has at most $N^{25/18+\varepsilon}$ sites of internal tangency. The circle tangency problem can be related to a problem about incidences between points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and light rays. For this problem, we introduce a stopping time argument to extract maximal information about well-spaced points from a refined decoupling theorem for the light cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$, leading to sharp bounds on the number of $\mu$-rich tangency rectangles.</description>

      <title>Complete monotonicity of log-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of a coupled system of thermostat-type via a Birkhoff-Kellogg type Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by means of Birkhoff--Kellogg type Theorem in cones we address the existence of eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors to a family of coupled system of thermostat type. The system is characterized by the presence of a real parameter that influences not only the differential equations but also the boundary conditions. Motivated by models of temperature regulation and feedback-controlled systems, we reformulate the original boundary value problems into systems of Hammerstein integral equations. The theoretical results are applied to three different classes of boundary conditions in $t=0$, which are supported by examples.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff measure of sets of non-Lyapunov behaviour, and a Jarnik-type theorem for random Schroedinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of the norms of transfer matrices of ergodic discrete Schr\"odinger operators in one dimension. It is known that the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is slower than prescribed by the Lyapunov exponent is residual in the part of the spectrum at which the Lyapunov exponent is positive. On the other hand, this exceptional set is of vanishing Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero. Here we show that this condition on $\rho(t)$ can not in general be improved: for operators with independent, identically distributed potentials of sufficiently regular distribution, the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is arbitrarily slow has infinite Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is non-increasing and not integrable at zero. The main technical ingredient, possibly of independent interest, is a Jarn\'ik-type theorem describing the Hausdorff measure of the set of real numbers well approximated by the eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator. The proof of this result relies on the theory of Anderson localisation and on the mass transference principle of Beresnevich--Velani.</description>

      <title>M\"obius inversion and coprime summation for error-sum functions of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly equal to $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</description>
