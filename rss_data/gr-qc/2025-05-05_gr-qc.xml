      <title>Charged Anisotropic Pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 in Non-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of charge on the stability of the pulsar star SAX J1748.9-2021 within the context of $f(\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{T})$ theory, where $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ represent the non-metricity scalar and the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. To achieve this, we employ the Krori-Barua metric ansatz with anisotropic fluid. We obtain exact relativistic solutions for the corresponding field equations. Additionally, we examine its physical and geometric properties using astrophysical observations of the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. This approach provides a basis for connecting several physical quantities, including fluid parameters, anisotropy, mass-radius relationship, compactness, redshift, \emph{energy}, the Zeldovich and causality conditions, equation of state parameter, adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Our findings align with observational evidence, indicating that the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 remains both feasible and stable under this modified theory.</description>

      <title>No-hair theorems in General Relativity and scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present review, we consider the status of the classification of the vacuum, stationary and asymptotically flat black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. Contrary to the similar problem in general relativity, the black hole classification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the very complicated character of the field equations and the very complex mathematical structure of the scalar-tensor gravity as a whole. We review most of the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate some of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black holes within scalar-tensor gravity. The proofs of the theorems and the underlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the review self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorems in general relativity and their proofs.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating black hole solution to Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study slowly rotating black hole solutions in the Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity (EBR) in four dimensions. At the leading order in the rotation parameter, the only modification with respect to the static case is the appearance of a non-vanishing $g_{t\phi}$ component. We construct approximate solutions to these equations and study how physical properties of the solutions, such as the angular velocity, photon sphere, black hole shadow, and innermost stable circular orbit, are modified, working to leading order in the coupling constant and the rotation parameter. Finally, we study the superradiance of a massive scalar wave scattering off slowly rotating black holes. Using direct integration, we derive the superradiant conditions and compute the energy flux through the event horizon and amplification factor. We demonstrate how the flux and amplification factor will change as a function of the black hole rotation and frequency of the incident wave.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Black Hole Perturbations in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full time-domain evolution of gravitational perturbations in black hole spacetimes arising in Einstein-Weyl gravity, a renormalizable extension of general relativity containing quadratic curvature corrections. We analyze both Schwarzschild and non-Schwarzschild solutions, focusing on monopole and higher multipole perturbations. Using semi-analytical methods based on the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization for approximation of the black hole spacetime and time-domain integration for analysis of evolution of perturbations, we study the late-time behavior of gravitational perturbations. Our results show that the ringdown phase is followed by universal slowly decaying oscillatory tails with the envelope $ \psi \propto t^{-5/6} $. We also demonstrate the breakdown of the eikonal correspondence between quasinormal modes and unstable null geodesics, highlighting limitations of the WKB method in this context. Our analysis confirms the range of (in)stability of black holes in Einstein-Weyl gravity found in recent publications.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of Pre-geometric Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity can arise from a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the context of pre-geometric gauge theories. In this work, we develop the Hamiltonian analysis of such theories. By making contact with the ADM formalism, we show that all the results of canonical General Relativity are correctly recovered in the IR limit of the spontaneously broken phase. We then apply Dirac's algorithm to study the algebra of constraints and determine the number of degrees of freedom in the UV limit of the unbroken phase. We also discuss possible pathways toward a UV completion of General Relativity, including a pre-geometric generalisation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and an extended BF formulation of the pre-geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge + matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory.</description>

      <title>Setting free the cosmic time in Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Wheeler-DeWitt approach to Quantum Cosmology leads to the problematic freeze of time. The reason is the enforcement of time re-parametrization invariance via the lapse function that is treated at least partially as an independent dynamical field. We show that the correct treatment of time re-parametrization gauge along the lines of the extended Hamiltonian formalism lifts the notorious ban on the cosmic time as evolution parameter in 3rd quantized cosmology.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>On the self-consistency of compact objects in Lorentz-violating gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistent solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity theories require the simultaneous satisfaction of: (i) the corresponding Einstein field equations, (ii) the matter field equations, and (iii) the Lorentz-violating field equations. In vacuum states, the dynamics of Lorentz-violating tensor fields may reduce to geometric constraints, potentially precluding entire classes of compact objects. These constraints are crucial for ensuring physical consistency in Lorentz-violating frameworks, as they eliminate metric families incompatible with the anisotropies induced by spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. We investigate the criteria governing the emergence of these geometric constraints and analyze their consequences. Our analysis establishes a consistency framework for evaluating compact objects in these theories, demonstrating that several previously reported solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity models are physically inadmissible.</description>

      <title>Observing boson stars in binary systems: The case of Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia experiment recently reported the observation of a binary system composed of a Sun-like star orbiting a dark compact object, known as Gaia BH1. The nature of the compact object remains uncertain. While the Gaia mission identifies it as a black hole candidate, the absence of X-ray or radio detections challenges that interpretation, and alternative exotic compact objects such as boson stars have also been suggested. In this paper, we study whether a boson star could account for the observed properties of the source. To do so we compute the X-ray luminosity of the central dark object as a result of spherically symmetric (Bondi-Michel) accretion of matter, comparing our results for the cases in which the dark object is a Schwarzschild black hole or a non rotating boson star. Our model incorporates realistic interstellar medium properties, ranging from hot ionized gas to dense molecular clouds. By solving the governing equations numerically, we calculate mass accretion rates and derive the resulting Bremsstrahlung X-ray luminosities. Black holes and boson stars fundamentally differ by the absence of an event horizon in the latter, which directly impacts accretion dynamics as there is an accumulation of mass in regions closer to the boson star, which will significantly change the observed X-ray emission. For the Gaia BH1 system we find that accretion onto a black hole yields luminosities of $\sim10^{27} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ which corresponds to an X-ray flux undetectable by Chandra sensitivity. On the other hand, boson star accretion can produce observable luminosities in the order of $10^{27} \ \text{to} \ 10^{41} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational signatures of dark matter with atom gradiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the purely gravitational signatures of dark matter from the ultralight to the ultraheavy mass range in proposed long-baseline atom gradiometers. Due to their exceptional acceleration sensitivity, proposed space-based experiments, such as MAGIS-space, AEDGE and AEDGE+, could detect a dark matter subcomponent which constitutes $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the local dark matter energy density and is populated by compact clumps of mass between $10^6$ kg and $10^{10}$ kg ($10^{-25}~M_\odot\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{-21}~M_\odot$), in an otherwise unexplored region of dark matter model space. Furthermore, because the gravitational observable depends on the relative gravitational time delay measured by spatially separated atomic clouds, we find that atom gradiometers are parametrically more sensitive than laser interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, to fast-oscillating spacetime perturbations sourced by energy density and pressure fluctuations of ultralight dark matter. In optimistic scenarios, space-based experiments are projected to probe a DM overdensity of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times the local dark matter energy density for masses $m\lesssim 10^{-17}$ eV. We therefore conclude that proposed atom gradiometers may be poised to detect dark matter through purely gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have recently found strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) in the nanohertz frequency regime. As GWs pass, they produce deviations in measured lengths and light-travel times. PTA experiments utilize the highly-consistent radio bursts from millisecond pulsars, distributed throughout the local galaxy, to identify miniscule timing deviations indicative of GWs. To distinguish GWs from noise, PTAs search for a particular correlation pattern between different pulsars called Hellings &amp; Downs correlations. The type of GW signal that has recently been identified is a stochastic GW background (GWB), which is observed to have more power at lower GW frequencies. A GWB matching these observations has long been predicted from super-massive black-hole (SMBH) binaries. SMBHs are known to exist in the centers of galaxies, which can then form binaries when two SMBHs are brought together following the merger of galaxies. No example of an SMBH binary has confidently been identified to date, and tremendous uncertainties about their formation and evolution remain. Alternative sources of the GWB have also been proposed, based on models for new fundamental physics, particularly in the early Universe. Improved sensitivity of PTAs will eventual lead to the characterization of GWB anisotropy and constraints on GWs from individual SMBH binaries, either of which could definitively demonstrate the true origin of the GWB. If the source is SMBH binaries, a variety of electromagnetic counterparts are possible, allowing for multimessenger astrophysics with low-frequency GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <title>Hubble-induced phase transitions in the Standard Model and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the dynamics of spectator scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity in the post-inflationary Universe, with particular emphasis on scenarios where the end of inflation is followed by a period of kination. In this context, the evolution of the Ricci scalar can lead to the spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous symmetries through tachyonic instabilities. These Hubble-induced phase transitions may cause the amplification of field fluctuations, the formation of transient topological defects, and an efficient energy transfer into relativistic degrees of freedom. We analyze this general mechanism and its cosmological consequences, including (re)heating and gravitational wave production. As a concrete realization, we discuss the postinflationary evolution of the Standard Model Higgs, examining the interplay between curvature effects, vacuum stability, and non-perturbative dynamics. This framework provides a minimal and predictive connection between high-energy physics and the early Universe, with potential observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\,\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>Holographic Conformal Anomaly and a-Theorem in 5D Scalar-Tensor Theories from Heterotic Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories-one Lovelock-Horndeski type and one Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet-obtained via a unified mechanism for Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional heterotic string effective action. In the Lovelock-Horndeski case, we also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles and establish a holographic a-theorem. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms, and show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Thus, we first investigate whether the Weinberg operator, a dimension-five-operator that generates neutrino masses without requiring degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model, can arise in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We find a negative answer with far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the Standard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of the visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\, \rm GeV$ for this bound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\, \rm GeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural" value of the Seesaw scale in a quantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound for the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\, \rm GeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated.</description>

      <title>New gravitational waveform model for precessing binary neutron stars with double-spin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two new frequency-domain gravitational waveform models for the analysis of signals emitted by binary neutron star coalescences: IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2. Both models are available through the public algorithm library LALSuite and represent the first extensions of IMRPhenomX models including matter effects. We show here that these two models represent a significant advancement in efficiency and accuracy with respect to their phenomenological predecessors, IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2. The computational efficiency of the new models is achieved through the application of the same multibanding technique previously applied to binary black hole models. Furthermore, IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 implements a more accurate description of the precession dynamics, including double-spin effects and, optionally, matter effects in the twisting-up construction. The latter are available through an option to use a numerical integration of the post-Newtonian precession equations. We show that the new precession descriptions allow the model to better reproduce the phenomenology observed in numerical-relativity simulations of precessing binary neutron stars. Finally, we present some applications of the new models to Bayesian parameter estimation studies, including a reanalysis of GW170817 and a study of simulated observations using numerical relativity waveforms for nonprecessing binary neutron stars with highly spinning components. We find that in these cases the new models make a negligible difference in the results. Nevertheless, by virtue of the aforementioned improvements, the new models represent valuable tools for the study of future detections of coalescing binary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The Critical Role of LIGO-India in the Era of Next-Generation Observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of LIGO-India in facilitating multi-messenger astronomy in the era of next generation observatories. A network with two L-shaped Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) would precisely localize nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger population up to a redshift of 0.5--over 10,000 events would be localized within $10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, including approximately 150 events within $0.1\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. Luminosity distance would be measured to within 10% for over 9,000 events and within 1% for $\sim 100$ events. Surprisingly, replacing the 20 km CE detector with LIGO-India operating at A$^\sharp$ sensitivity (I$^\sharp$) yields nearly identical performance. The factor-of-five shorter arms are offset by a fourfold increase in baseline relative to a second CE in the U.S., preserving localization accuracy, with over 9,000 events within $10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$ and $\sim 90$ events within $0.1\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. This configuration detects $\sim 6,000$ events with luminosity distance uncertainties under 10%, including $\sim 50$ events with under 1%. Both networks provide $\mathcal{O}(100)$ early-warning detections up to 10 minutes before merger, with localization areas $\leq 10\ \mathrm{deg}^2$. While I$^\sharp$ enables excellent localization and early warnings, its shorter arms and narrower sensitivity band would limit its reach for other science goals, such as detecting population III binary black hole mergers at $z \gtrsim 10$, neutron star mergers at $z \sim 2$, or constraining cosmological parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the von Laue condition: Implications for the on-shell Lagrangian of particles and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper pressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we consider a simple illustrative example: nonstandard static global monopoles with finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the proper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however, that the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite distance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero by no more than the energy located outside the specified volume (under the assumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the maximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the on-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed three times the outer energy fraction. Extending these results to real particles, we demonstrate that these constraints generally hold for finite-mass systems with fixed structure, including stable atomic nuclei, provided the dominant energy condition is satisfied. Specifically, we show that, except in extremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of the particles themselves, the volume average of the aforementioned ratio must be extremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids, which is often a crucial element for accurately modeling the dynamics of the gravity and matter, especially in scenarios involving nonminimal couplings to other matter fields or gravity. We find that, in general, the ideal gas on-shell Lagrangian provides an accurate approximation of the true on-shell Lagrangian, even for nonideal gases with significant interparticle interactions.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ nonlinear sigma model. We first analyze the static, spherically symmetric black hole solution, focusing on its asymptotically Anti-de Sitter behavior and causal structure. The Modified Newman-Janis Algorithm is then applied to obtain the rotating counterpart, followed by an examination of its geometric properties, ergoregions, and causal structure. Utilizing the Lagrangian formalism, we derive the equations of motion for photons and study the resulting black hole shadow on the celestial plane. We explore the dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the black hole parameters $K$ and $N$, imposing constraints using EHT observational data for M87* and Sgr A*. Finally, we analyze the black hole's evaporation rate under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit realization of the action of the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ loop algebra on fields at null infinity. This action is directly derived by Penrose transform of the geometrical action of $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in twistor space, ensuring that it forms a representation of the algebra. Finally, we show that this action coincides with the canonical action of $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Noether charges on the asymptotic phase space.</description>

Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>The Irrelevance of Primordial Black Hole Clustering in the LVK mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primordial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales. This conclusion might not hold for lighter masses potentially accessible by future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>
