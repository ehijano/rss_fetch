      <title>PROTOCALC, A W-band polarized calibrator for CMB Telescopes: application to Simons Observatory and CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will measure polarization anisotropies with unprecedented sensitivities. The need for high precision in these measurements underscores the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of instrument properties, with a particular emphasis on the study of the beam properties and, in particular, their polarization characteristics, and the measurement of the polarization angle. In this context, a major challenge lies in the scarcity of millimeter polarized astrophysical sources with sufficient brightness and calibration knowledge to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future CMB missions. This led to the development of a drone-borne calibration source designed for frequency band centered on approximately 90 GHz band, matching a commonly used channel in ground based CMB measurements. The PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, has undergone thorough in-lab testing, and its properties have been subsequently modeled through simulation software integrated into the standard Simons Observatory (SO) analysis pipeline. Moreover, the PROTOCALC system has been tested in the field, having been deployed twice on calibration campaigns with CMB telescopes in the Atacama desert. The data collected constrain the roll angle of the source with a statistical accuracy of $0.045^\circ$.</description>

      <title>A Millimeter-Wave Photometric Camera for Long-Range Imaging Through Optical Obscurants Using Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive imaging through optical obscurants is a promising application for mm-wave sensing. We have thus developed the Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Passive Radiometer (SKIPR), a 150 GHz polarization-sensitive photometric camera optimized for terrestrial imaging using a focal plane array with 3,840 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present a full description of the instrument design, with a particular emphasis on the cryogenic system based on a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler with a two-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator and a dedicated 1.59 m crossed Dragone telescope with an altitude/azimuth mount. We include a detailed lab-based characterization of the KIDs, which results in a determination of their superconducting resonator parameters and optical properties. We also present in situ measurements from the telescope, including point-spread functions and noise characterization. In sum, we find that SKIPR performs as expected, providing diffraction-limited imaging with detector noise performance set by the random arrivals of photons from the ambient background. There is minimal variation in detector characteristics over the full SKIPR focal plane array, and the overall detector yield is 92 per cent.</description>

      <title>MadVoro: Parallel Construction of Voronoi Diagrams in Distributed Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voronoi diagrams are essential geometrical structures with numerous applications, particularly astrophysics-driven finite volume methods. While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GammaTPC, a transformative 0.1-10 MeV $\gamma$-ray instrument concept featuring a tracker using a liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC) technology with the novel GAMPix high spatial resolution and ultra low power charge readout. These enable an economical instrument with unprecedented effective area and sensitivity. We discuss the design and technology in some detail, including how a LAr TPC can be staged in space. Finally, we present a first study of the sensitivity of the instrument in the Compton regime using a new framework for analyzing Compton telescope data.</description>

      <title>Length dependence of waveform mismatch: a caveat on waveform accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration's code SpEC can now routinely simulate binary black hole mergers undergoing $\sim25$ orbits, with the longest simulations undergoing nearly $\sim180$ orbits. While this sounds impressive, the mismatch between the highest resolutions for this long simulation is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. Meanwhile, the mismatch between resolutions for the more typical simulations tends to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, despite the resolutions being similar to the long simulations'. In this note, we explain why mismatch alone gives an incomplete picture of code -- and waveform -- quality, especially in the context of providing waveform templates for LISA and 3G detectors, which require templates with $\mathcal{O}(10^{3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{5})$ orbits. We argue that to ready the GW community for the sensitivity of future detectors, numerical relativity groups must be aware of this caveat, and also run future simulations with at least three resolutions to properly assess waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>A general Bayesian model-validation framework based on null-test evidence ratios, with an example application to global 21-cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing composite models for multi-component observational data is a prevalent scientific challenge. When fitting composite models, there exists the potential for systematics from a poor fit of one model component to be absorbed by another, resulting in the composite model providing an accurate fit to the data in aggregate but yielding biased a posteriori estimates for individual components. We begin by defining a classification scheme for composite model comparison scenarios, identifying two categories: category I, where models with accurate and predictive components are separable through Bayesian comparison of the unvalidated composite models, and category II, where models with accurate and predictive components may not be separable due to interactions between components, leading to spurious detections or biased signal estimation. To address the limitations of category II model comparisons, we introduce the Bayesian Null Test Evidence Ratio-based (BaNTER) validation framework. Applying this classification scheme and BaNTER to a composite model comparison problem in 21-cm cosmology, where minor systematics from imperfect foreground modelling can bias global 21-cm signal recovery, we validate six composite models using mock data. We show that incorporating BaNTER alongside Bayes-factor-based comparison reliably ensures unbiased inferences of the signal of interest across both categories, positioning BaNTER as a valuable addition to Bayesian inference workflows with potential applications across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Three Years of High-Contrast Imaging of the PDS 70 b and c Exoplanets at H{\alpha} with MagAO-X: Evidence of Strong Protoplanet H{\alpha} Variability and Circumplanetary Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 3 years of high-contrast imaging of the PDS 70 b and c accreting protoplanets with the new extreme AO system MagAO-X as part of the MaxProtoPlanetS survey of H$\alpha$ protoplanets. In 2023 and 2024 our sharp (25-27 mas FWHM); well AO corrected (20-26% Strehl), deep (2-3.6hr) images detect compact (r~30 mas; r~3 au) circumplanetary disks (CPDs) surrounding both protoplanets. Starlight scattering off the dusty outer edges of these CPDs is the likely source of the bright compact continuum light detected within ~30 mas of both planets in our simultaneously obtained continuum 668 nm filter images. After subtraction of contaminating continuum and PSF residuals with pyKLIP ADI and SDI we obtained high-contrast ASDI H$\alpha$ images of both planets in 2022, 2023 and 2024. We find the H$\alpha$ line flux of planet b fell by (8.1$\pm$1.6)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ a factor of 4.6 drop in flux from 2022 to 2023. In March 2024, planet b continued to be faint with just a slight 1.6x rise to an H$\alpha$ line flux of (3.64$\pm$0.87)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. For c we measure a significant increase of (2.74$\pm$0.51)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ from 2023 to 2024 which is a factor of 2.3x increase. So both protoplanets have recently experienced significant H$\alpha$ variability with ~1 yr sampling. In 2024, planet c is brighter than b: as c is brightening and b generally fading. We also tentatively detect one new point source "CC3" inside the inner disk (~49 mas; at PA~295 deg; 2024) with orbital motion roughly consistent with a ~5.6 au orbit.</description>

      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>COSMIC-S: a photometric Catalogue of Observed Stars in the Small MagellanIc Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) is a wide-field instrument mounted on the 4m V. Blanco Telescope (CTIO). Its impressive technical characteristics makes it one of the most suitable ground-based telescope for the production of accurate stellar photometry even towards crowded regions such as the Magellanic Clouds. We analysed DECam images acquired from February 2018 to January 2020 towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. We performed a PSF photometry by using the SExtractor and PSFEx tools and producing a comprehensive photometric catalogue in the SDSS system, considering the $gri$ filters. Then, we present COSMIC-S, a photometric catalogue consisting of 10 971 906 sources, including $gri$ magnitudes with a mean error $&lt;\sigma_m&gt; \simeq 0.04$ mag. A total of 2 456 434 sources have good photometry in all three bands. The catalogue appears virtually complete to $m \simeq 22$, with a limiting magnitude $m\simeq 25$. We derived the colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams in order to prove the goodness of the catalogue.</description>

      <title>A Python Toolkit for Plotting Double Star Observations with 1:1 Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of double star astrometric data is essential for effective analysis and interpretation. This article presents a Python toolkit designed for astronomers who need to plot measurements from diverse sources -- historical, Gaia DR3, and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network -- while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio to avoid visually distorting the data. The toolkit is composed of three scripts: one that handles polar coordinates (P.A., separation), one for Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates, and another with the option to include predicted theoretical points. This paper describes the purpose, functionality, and usage of these scripts, including example figures, installation guides, and licensing information.
  This toolkit has been used by the author and collaborators in published and submitted research on double star systems, demonstrating its versatility for both professional and student-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower-energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training data set of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.</description>

      <title>Search Capability for Near-Earth Objects with the Wide Field Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with a powerful sky survey capability in the northern hemisphere, will play an important role in asteroid searching and monitoring. However, WFST is not a telescope dedicated to near-Earth asteroids (NEOs) searching. In order to improve the efficiency of finding NEOs on the premise of meeting the needs of other scientific research, we ran mock observations for WFST to study its search capability for NEOs. The NEO population model, the WFST detection model and site conditions are taken into account in our simulations. Based on the original scheduling scheme, we present two new schemes. Compared to the original scheme, the optimized scheme can improve the search capability of known and unknown NEOs by 100\% and 50\%. We also emphasized the importance of trailing loss and proposed an improved effective field of view model. In addition, it is predicted that adopting the clear-day ratio of 0.7 and the optimized scheme, during one year of regular survey, for NEOs with absolute magnitude from 17 to 25, WFST can provide tracklets for about 1800 NEOs if their orbits are known, and in the case of blind search, more than 600 NEOs can be found by WFST. The new schemes provide valuable reference and suggestions for the WFST's regular survey strategy.</description>
