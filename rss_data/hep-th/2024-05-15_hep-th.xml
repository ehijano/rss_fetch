      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a $5D$ generalization of the Hawking {\it et al.} black string in a Randall Sundrum setup. The embedded $4D$ geometry corresponds to the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime, which can represent a traversable wormhole, a one-way wormhole, or a regular black hole. To achieve this, we linearly deform both the bulk geometry and the bulk matter distribution with respect to a coupling constant. These deformations induce a transition from a $5D$ vacuum AdS distribution to an anisotropic distribution. The latter results in the induced geometry on the brane transitioning from a singular Schwarzschild spacetime to a regularized SV spacetime. Since there are no sources or matter fields on the brane, we can assert that the induced SV geometry on the brane arises from the influence of geometrical and matter deformations in the bulk. Thus, the central singularity is suppressed. We determine the cases where the energy conditions are either satisfied or violated. Our spacetime is asymptotically radial AdS, which is intriguing given the absence of a global AdS box that would prevent instability under larger wavelength perturbations. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to claim that instability exists for very small perturbations near the AdS horizon.</description>

      <title>An Area Law for Entanglement Entropy in Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering cross section is the effective area of collision when two particles collide. Quantum mechanically, it is a measure of the probability for a specific process to take place. Employing wave packets to describe the scattering process, we compute the entanglement entropy in 2-to-2 scattering of particles in a general setting using the $S$-matrix formalism. Applying the optical theorem, we show that the linear entropy $\mathcal{E}_2$ is given by the elastic cross section $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ in unit of the transverse size $L^2$ of the wave packet, $\mathcal{E}_2 \sim \sigma_{\text{el}}/L^2$, when the initial states are not entangled. The result allows for dual interpretations of the entanglement entropy as an area and as a probability. Since $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ is generally believed, and observed experimentally, to grow with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ in the high energy regime, the result suggests a "second law" of entanglement entropy for high energy collisions. Furthermore, the Froissart bound places an upper limit on the entropy growth.</description>

      <title>The Fusion Categorical Diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a Frobenius algebra over fusion categories of the form Rep$(G)\boxtimes$Rep$(G)$ which generalizes the diagonal subgroup of $G\times G$. This allows us to extend field theoretical constructions which depend on the existence of a diagonal subgroup to non-invertible symmetries. We give explicit calculations for theories with Rep$(S_3)\boxtimes$Rep$(S_3)$ symmetry, applying the results to gauging topological quantum field theories which carry this non-invertible symmetry. Along the way, we also discuss how Morita equivalence is implemented for algebras in symmetry categories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent action for heterotic and type II superstring field theory was recently proposed by Sen. We give an algebraic formulation of this action in terms of certain twisted $L_\infty$-algebra. We further show that Sen's Wilsonian effective superstring field action can be obtained using homotopy transfer and the effective theory also possesses the algebraic structure of a twisted $L_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

      <title>Random Bond perturbations of the $O(2)$ vector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quenched disorder in the critical $O(2)$ vector model. We first review, in the modern language of Conformal Perturbation Theory, the random temperature perturbation in $4-\epsilon$. Then, we present a direct computation in $3d$. The pure CFT is now strongly interacting, and its CFT data are determined in recent numerical bootstrap studies. We then explore the anisotropic disorder associated with the lowest-dimension charge-$2$ scalar, which is relevant in $3d$. This perturbation breaks locally $O(2)$. However, the symmetry is restored in the IR in a weakly coupled new fixed point.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>5d 2-Chern-Simons theory and 3d integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $4$-dimensional semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory of Costello and Yamazaki provides a gauge-theoretic origin for the Lax connection of $2$-dimensional integrable field theories. The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to the setting of $3$-dimensional integrable field theories by considering a $5$-dimensional semi-holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory for a higher connection $(A,B)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$. The input data for this theory are the choice of a meromorphic $1$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and a strict Lie $2$-group with cyclic structure on its underlying Lie $2$-algebra. Integrable field theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are constructed by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the connection $(A,B)$ at the $3$-dimensional defects located at the poles of $\omega$ and choosing certain admissible meromorphic solutions of the bulk equations of motion. The latter provides a natural notion of higher Lax connection for $3$-dimensional integrable field theories, including a $2$-form component $B$ which can be integrated over Cauchy surfaces to produce conserved charges. As a first application of this approach, we show how to construct a generalization of Ward's $(2+1)$-dimensional integrable chiral model from a suitable choice of data in the $5$-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Coupling renormalization flow in the strongly interacting regime of an asymptotically free quantum field theory in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar quantum field theory with global $O(N)^3$ symmetry in four Euclidean dimensions and solve it numerically in closed form in the large-N limit. For imaginary tetrahedral coupling the theory is asymptotically free, with stable and real quantum effective action. We demonstrate the dynamical build-up of a strong interaction as the correlation length increases in a regime where the coupling renormalization flow remains well-defined in the infrared. This is in contrast to perturbative results of asymptotically free theories, which predict that the coupling becomes ill-defined in the infrared, like in quantum chromodynamics. These properties make the model an important laboratory for the study of strong-coupling phenomena in quantum field theory from first principles.</description>

      <title>Orbifolded Elliptic Genera of Non-Compact Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the flavored elliptic genus of the N=2 superconformal cigar model and generalize the analysis of the path integral result to the case of real central charge. It gives rise to a non-holomorphic modular covariant function generalizing completed mock modular forms. We also compute the genus for angular orbifolds of the cigar and Liouville theory and decompose it in terms of discrete and continuous contributions. The orbifolded elliptic genus at fractional level is a completed mock modular form with a shadow related to U$(1)$ modular invariants at rational radius squared. We take the limit of the orbifolded genera towards a weighted ground state index and carefully interpret the contributions. We stress that the orbifold cigar and Liouville theories have a maximal and a minimal radius, respectively.</description>

      <title>Duality and Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model that describes the quantum black hole evaporation unitarily in a Hilbert space of infinite dimension. This construction generalizes Page's finite dimensional approach to infinite dimensions. The basic ingredient is the Murray-von Neumann coupling for finite type II factors. This coupling measures, at each time of the evaporation, the relative continuous dimension of the radiation and the black hole subspaces. The unitary transformation, implementing the quantum evaporation and thus determining the time dependence of the coupling, is identified with the dual modular automorphism. In the appendix we sketch, using von Neumann construction of infinite tensor products of EPR pairs of q-bits, some q-bit holographic correspondences as well as an algebraic definition of ER bridges.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in curved tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Penrose limit in the case of two gravity duals. One of them, consists of compactified I-branes (intersecting sets of D5-branes over $(1+1)$ dimensions). The second consists of D5-branes compactified on a circle. Both compactifications preserve SUSY. We find a match of the oscillators and masses of string modes on the resulting pp wave against a spin chain in a $(2+1)-$dimensional field theory in the first case, and a spin chain in a $(1+1)-$dimensional field theory in the second.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Perturbation of Hairy Black Holes in EsGB theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate scalar field perturbations of the hairy black holes involved with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global U(1) symmetry in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory for asymptotically flat spacetimes. We consider the mechanism that black holes without hairs become unstable at the critical point of the coupling constant and undergo a phase transition to hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This transition occurs near the black hole horizon due to the diminishing influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term at infinity. To examine such process, we introduce a scalar field perturbation on the newly formed background spacetime. We solve the linearized perturbation equation using Green's function method. We begin by solving the Green's function, incorporating the branch cut contribution. This allows us to analytically investigate the late-time behavior of the perturbation at both spatial and null infinity. We found that the late-time behavior only differs from the Schwarzschild black hole by a mass term. We then proceed to calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) numerically, which arise from the presence of poles in the Green's function. Our primary interest lies in utilizing QNMs to investigate the stability of the black hole solutions both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases. Consistent with the prior study, our analysis shows that hairy black holes in the symmetric phase become unstable when the quadratic coupling constant exceeds a critical value for a fixed value of the quartic coupling constant. In contrast, hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase are always stable at the critical value. These numerical results provide strong evidence for a dynamical process that unstable black holes without hairs transition into stable hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase through the spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Giving a $KO$ to 8D Gauge Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Garcia-Etxebarria:2017crf}, it was found that the system of $k$ D7-branes probing an $O7^+$-plane suffers from an $\mathfrak{sp}(k)$ gauge anomaly when $k&gt;1$. These authors then conjectured that this 8D $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory couples to an 8D topological field theory (TFT) such that the total system is anomaly-free, thus acting as a "topological" Green-Schwarz mechanism. In this note, we construct such an 8D TFT and show that it indeed cancels the gauge anomaly. The key step is to engineer the relevant topological operators from D3-branes and fluxbranes placed infinitely far away from the stack of 7-branes. Such symmetry operators have topological vector bundles defined on them whose $KO/KSp$-homology classes play a role in the anomaly cancellation.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals consist of binary systems of compact objects, with orders of magnitude differences in their masses, in the regime where the dynamics are driven by gravitational wave emission. The unique nature of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals facilitates the exploration of diverse and stimulating tests related to various aspects of black holes and General Relativity. These tests encompass investigations into the spacetime geometry, the dissipation of the binary system energy and angular momentum, and the impact of the intrinsic non-linear effects of the gravitational interaction. This review accounts for the manifold opportunities for testing General Relativity, ranging from examinations of black hole properties to cosmological and multimessenger tests.</description>

      <title>New sources of ghost fields in $k$-essence theories for black-bounce solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we generalize the possible ghost field configurations within the framework of $k$-essence theory to the Simpson-Visser metric area function $\Sigma^2=x^2+a^2$. Our analysis encompasses field configurations for the region-defined metric function $dA_\pm$ as well as the general solution that asymptotically behaves as Schwarzschild-de Sitter for $x\to-\infty$. Specifically, we investigate two scalar field configurations and define the associated potential for each one. Through rigorous calculations, we verify that all equations of motion are satisfied. Notably, our findings indicate that even when proposing new configurations of ghost scalar fields, the energy conditions remain unchanged. This result serves to validate the wormhole solutions obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Principle and Machian origin of extended gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chae's analyses on GAIA observations of wide binary stars have fortified the paradigm of extended gravity with particular attention to MOND-like theories. We recall that, starting from the origin of Einstein's general relativity, the request of Mach on the structure of the theory has been the core of the foundational debate. This issue is strictly connected with the nature of the mass-energy equivalence. This was exactly the key point that Einstein used to derive the same general relativity. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and the open questions within extended gravity theories, which have recently been further strengthened by analyses of GAIA observations, request a better understanding of the Equivalence Principle. By considering a direct coupling between the Ricci curvature scalar and the matter Lagrangian a non geodesic ratio between the inertial and the gravitational mass can be fixed and MOND-like theories are retrieved at low energies.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Strings or Seeds?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of QCD axion strings in the cosmological history of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking, focussing on the minimal KSVZ axion model. We consider the case of the pure SM Higgs potential as well as a simple scenario with a first order EW phase transition. We capture the effect of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) sector within an effective-theory approach for the Higgs field, where the axion string core and the heavy PQ states are integrated out. The relevant parameters in this effective theory are controlled by the size of the portal coupling between the Higgs and the PQ scalar, and the mass of the PQ radial excitation. We determine the range of portal couplings for which the axion strings can strongly affect the dynamics of EW symmetry breaking. In the case of a first order EW phase transition, the strings can act as seeds by either catalyzing the nucleation of (non-spherical) bubbles, or leading to the completion of the phase transition by triggering a classical instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic and gravitational properties of AdS black shells (also referred to as AdS black bubbles) -- a class of quantum gravity motivated black hole mimickers, that in the classical limit are described as ultra compact shells of matter. We find that their electromagnetic properties are remarkably similar to black holes. We then discuss the extent to which these objects are distinguishable from black holes, both for intrinsic interest within the black shell model, and as a guide for similar efforts in other sub-classes of exotic compact objects (ECOs). We study photon rings and lensing band characteristics, relevant for very large baseline inteferometry (VLBI) observations, as well as gravitational wave observables -- quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and the static tidal Love number for non-spinning shells -- relevant for ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a non-uniform external Maxwell field using a manifestly Lorentz covariant action principle which easily reproduces the known Vandervoort equations of motion. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that this hydrodynamics applies more generally than the kinetic theory, e.g., for strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the effective theory of electrically charged, spatially extended, infinitely heavy objects at leading power. The theory may be viewed as a generalization of NRQED for particles with a finite charge distribution where the charge radius and higher moments of the charge distribution are counted as $O(1)$ rather than $O(1/M)$. We show this is equivalent to a Wilson line traced by the worldline of an extended charge distribution. Our canonical use case is atomic nuclei with large charge $Z\gg 1$. The theory allows for the insertion of external operators and is sufficiently general to allow a treatment of both electromagnetic and weak mediated lepton-nucleus scattering including charged-current processes. This provides a first step towards the factorization of Coulomb regions, including structure dependence arising from a finite charge distribution, for scattering with nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Low-virtuality splitting in the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the available collision energy is much above the mass of the particles involved, scattering amplitudes feature kinematic configurations that are enhanced by the much lower virtuality of some intermediate particle. Such configurations generally factorise in terms of a hard scattering amplitude with exactly on-shell intermediate particle, times universal factors. In the case of real radiation emission, such factors are splitting amplitudes that describe the creation or the annihilation -- for initial or final state splittings -- of the low-virtuality particle and the creation of the real radiation particles. We compute at tree-level the amplitudes describing all the splittings that take place in the Standard Model when the collision energy is much above the electroweak scale. Unlike previous results, our splitting amplitudes fully describe the low-virtuality kinematic regime, which includes the region of collinear splitting, of soft emission, and combinations thereof. The splitting amplitudes are compactly represented as little-group tensors in an improved bi-spinor formalism for massive spin-1 particles that automatically incorporates the Goldstone Boson Equivalence Theorem. Simple explicit expressions are obtained using a suitably defined infinite-momentum helicity basis representation of the spinor variables. Our results, combined with the known virtual contributions, could enable systematic predictions of the leading electroweak radiation effects in high-energy scattering processes, with particularly promising phenomenological applications to the physics of future colliders with very high energy such as a muon collider.</description>

Abstract: We study vacua of moduli potential consisting of multiple contribution of modular forms in a finite modular symmetry. If the potential is given by a single modular form, the Minkowski vacuum is realized at the fixed point of the modular symmetry. We show that de Sitter vacuum is realized with a multiple modular form case and obtain a non-trivial vacuum which is away from the fixed point, i.e. a large modulus vacuum expectation value, depending on the choice of the weight and representation of the modular forms. We study these vacua by a numerical and analytically. It is also found that vacua obtained in this paper preserve CP symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge invariance of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect with a quantum treatment for the electromagnetic field is demonstrated. We provide an exact solution for the electromagnetic ground energy due to the interaction of the quantum electromagnetic field with the classical charges and currents that act as sources of the potentials in a classical description, in the Lorenz gauge. Then, we use first-order perturbation theory to compute an extra change on the electromagnetic ground energy due to the presence of a quantum charged particle with known wave function in the system. This energy in general depends on the quantum particle path in an interferometer, what results in an AB phase difference between the paths. The gauge invariance of this AB phase difference is then shown for the magnetic, electric, and the recently proposed electrodynamic versions of the AB effect. However, the AB phase difference could depend on the gauge for nonclosed paths, what reinforces the view that it only can be measured in closed paths.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and their coeval gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <title>The Bell Based Super Coherent States. Uncertainty Relations, Golden Ratio and Fermion-Boson Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The set of maximally fermion-boson entangled Bell super-coherent states is introduced. A superposition of these states with separable bosonic coherent states, represented by points on the super-Bloch sphere, we call the Bell based super-coherent states. Entanglement of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in these states is studied by using displacement bosonic operator. It acts on the super-qubit reference state, representing superposition of the zero and the one super-number states, forming computational basis super-states. We show that the states are completely characterized by displaced Fock states, as a superposition with non-classical, the photon added coherent states, and the entanglement is independent of coherent state parameter $\alpha$ and of the time evolution. In contrast to never orthogonal Glauber coherent states, our entangled super-coherent states can be orthogonal. The uncertainty relation in the states is monotonically growing function of the concurrence and for entangled states we get non-classical quadrature squeezing and representation of uncertainty by ratio of two Fibonacci numbers. The sequence of concurrences, and corresponding uncertainties $\hbar F_n/F_{n+1}$, in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty $, convergent to the Golden ratio uncertainty $\hbar/\varphi$, where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is found.</description>

Abstract: We show that the full Horndeski theory with both curvature and torsion can support nonsingular, stable and subluminal cosmological solutions at all times. Thus, with torsion, the usual No-Go theorem that holds in a curved spacetime is avoided. In particular, it is essential to include the nonminimal derivative couplings of the $\mathcal{L}_{5}$ part of the Horndeski action ($G^{\mu\nu}\,\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \phi,$ and $(\nabla^2 \phi)^3$). Without the latter a No-Go already impedes the eternal subluminality of nonsingular, stable cosmologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the symmetry-reduced cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe driven by a quintessence scalar field with potential. Our study focuses on semi-classical regime. In particular, we derive the GUP-distorted Friedmann, Raychaudhuri, and the Klein-Gordon equation. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the qualitative dynamics for the choice of potential $V(\phi)= V_0 \sinh^{-n}{(\mu \phi)}$. This involves constructing an autonomous dynamical system of equations by choosing appropriate dynamical variables, followed by a qualitative study using linear stability theory. Our analysis shows that incorporating GUP significantly changes the existing fixed points compared to the limiting case without quantum effects by switching off the GUP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It shown that if a vector space carries commuting actions of two Clifford algebras, then the quadratic monomials using generators from either Clifford algebra determine a spinor representation of an orthogonal Lie algebra.
  Examples of this construction have applications to high energy physics, particularly to the standard model and unification. It is shown how to use Clifford data to construct spectral triples for the Pati-Salam model that admit an action of Spin(10).</description>

      <title>Lepton-Pair Scattering With an Off-Shell and an On-Shell Photon at Two Loops in Massless QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present the computation of the two-loop amplitudes for the scattering of a lepton pair with an off-shell and an on-shell photon in massless QED. We apply modern techniques developed to tackle QCD amplitudes with many scales: we express the Feynman integrals in terms of a basis of special functions, and reconstruct the amplitudes from numerical finite-field evaluations. Our results complete the amplitude-level ingredients for the N3LO predictions of electron-muon scattering needed to meet the precision target of the future MUonE experiment.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Interferometric Signatures Beyond The Universal Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the interferometric signatures of black hole photon rings beyond the universal regime by perturbatively including the effects of finite ring width. Our approach first slices a thick ring into a series of thin rings, each of which falls within the universal regime. We thus calculate the visibility of the thick ring by aggregating the contributions from each thin ring, and then perturbatively expand the result into polynomials of the baseline length $u$. We show that the visibility amplitude of a thick ring depends on its "center-of-light" diameter; it also includes additional higher-order corrections due to the width of the ring, with the leading correction terms proportional to $u^2$ for the envelope and $u^3$ for the phase. We apply our method to images ray traced from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and demonstrate that incorporating the higher-order corrections is crucial for accurately modeling the visibility of the first photon ring around M87*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new set of BMS charges at null infinity, characterized by a super-translation flux that contains only the `hard' term. This is achieved with a specific corner improvement of the symplectic 2-form, and we spell the conditions under which it is unique. The charges are associated to a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential, and satisfy all standard criteria: they are covariant, provide a center-less realization of the symmetry algebra, have vanishing flux in non-radiative spacetimes, and vanish in Minkowski. We use them to define a certain notion of localized energy density of gravitational waves. They have potential applications to the generalized second law and to soft theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that effective actions for warped compactifications can be subtle, with large deviations in the effective potential from naive expectations owing to constraint equations from the higher-dimensional metric. We demonstrate this deviation in a careful computation of the effective potential for the conifold deformation parameter of the Klebanov-Strassler solution. The uncorrected naive effective potential for the conifold was previously used to argue that the Klebanov-Strassler background would be destabilized by antibranes placed at the conifold infrared tip unless the flux was uncomfortably large. We show this result is too strong because the formerly neglected constraint equations eliminate the features of the potential that allowed for the instability in the de Sitter uplift of the KKLT scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By generalizing the density matrix to a transition matrix between two states, represented as $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$, one can define the pseudoentropy analogous to the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we establish an operator sum rule that pertains to the reduced transition matrix and reduced density matrices corresponding to the superposition states of $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$. It is demonstrated that the off-diagonal elements of operators can be correlated with the expectation value in the superposition state. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection between the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of the superposition states. We provide proof of the operator sum rule and verify its validity in both finite-dimensional systems and quantum field theory. We additionally demonstrate the significance of these sum rules in gaining insights into the physical implications of transition matrices, pseudoentropy, and their gravity dual.</description>

Abstract: We consider six-dimensional higher-derivative ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric gauge theory coupled with the hypermultiplet. We use the background superfield method in six-dimensional ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ harmonic superspace to study the effective action in the theory. Using the dimensional regularization scheme we analyze the one-loop divergent contributions to the effective action. We demonstrate that UV behaviour is determined by the higher-derivative term for gauge multiplet sector.</description>

Abstract: Modular Graph Functions (MGFs) are SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$)-invariant functions that emerge in the study of the low-energy expansion of the one-loop closed string amplitude. To find the string scattering amplitude, we must integrate MGFs over the moduli space of the torus. In this paper, we use the iterated integral representation of MGFs to establish a depth-dependent basis for them, where "depth" refers to the number of iterations in the integral. This basis has a suitable Laplace equation. We integrate this basis from depth zero to depth three over the fundamental domain of SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) with a cut-off.</description>

Abstract: We compute the potential energy for the dilaton, complex structure and Kahler moduli and search of realistic vacua of heterotic M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. We present a protocol for deriving the potential that combines the non-perturbative complex structure, gaugino condensate and worldsheet instanton superpotentials in theories in which the hidden sector contains an anomalous $U(1)$ structure group. The Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation induces inhomogeneous axion transformations for the imaginary components of the dilaton and Kahler modulus. Using this protocol we obtain explicit examples in which potential has a global minimum at negative or zero vacuum density or a metastable minimum with positive vacuum density. In all three cases, the dilaton, Kahler modulus and associated axion moduli are completely stabilized. Finally, we show that, for any of these vacua, the potential energy satisfies the large scalar field Swampland conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of local operators in a CFT below a given twist grows with spin. Consistency with analyticity in spin then requires that at low spin, infinitely many Regge trajectories must decouple from local correlation functions, implying infinitely many vanishing conditions for OPE coefficients. In this paper we explain the mechanism behind this infinity of zeros. Specifically, the mechanism is related to the two-point function rather than the three-point function, explaining the vanishing of OPE coefficients in every correlator from a single condition. We illustrate our result by studying twist-4 Regge trajectories in the Wilson--Fisher CFT at one loop.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the ``very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective action in renormalizable quantum theory of gravity provides entropy because the total Hamiltonian vanishes. Since it is a renormalization group invariant that is constant in the process of cosmic evolution, we can show conservation of entropy, which is an ansatz in the standard cosmology. Here, we study renormalizable quantum gravity that exhibits conformal dominance at high energy beyond the Planck scale. The current entropy of the universe is derived by calculating the effective action under the scenario of quantum gravity inflation caused by its dynamics. We then argue that ghost modes must be unphysical but are necessary for the Hamiltonian to vanish and for entropy to exist in gravitational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic duality between higher-spin (HS) gravity in 4d and free vector models in 3d, with special attention to the role of N=2 supersymmetry (SUSY). For the type-A bosonic bulk theory, dual to spin-0 fields on the boundary, there exists a twistor-space description; this maps both single-trace boundary operators and linearized bulk fields to spacetime-independent twistor functions, whose HS-algebra products compute all boundary correlators. Here, we extend this description to the type-B bosonic theory (dual to spin-1/2 fields on the boundary), and to the supersymmetric theory containing both. A key role is played by boundary bilocals, which in type-A are dual to the Didenko-Vasiliev 1/2-BPS "black hole". We extend this to an infinite family of linearized 1/2-BPS "black hole" solutions. Remarkably, the full supersymmetric theory (along with the SUSY generators) fits in the same space of twistor functions as the type-A theory. Instead of two sets of bosonic bulk fields, the formalism sees one set of linearized fields, but with both types of boundary data allowed.</description>

Abstract: Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale and takes the form of a Lorentzian lattice, or "causal set", from which continuum spacetime emerges in a large-scale (low-energy) approximation. In this work, we present new developments in the framework of interacting quantum field theory on causal sets. We derive a diagrammatic expansion for in-in correlators in local scalar field theories with finite polynomial interactions. We outline how these same correlators can be computed using the double-path integral which acts as a generating functional for the in-in correlators. We modify the in-in generating functional to obtain a generating functional for in-out correlators. We define a notion of scattering amplitudes on causal sets with non-interacting past and future regions and verify that they are given by S-matrix elements (matrix elements of the time-evolution operator). We describe how these formal developments can be implemented to compute early universe observables under the assumption that spacetime is fundamentally discrete.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf symmetry and tube algebra of the generalized multifusion string-net model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry, serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$ phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. As an application of our model, we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted multifusion string-net.</description>

      <title>Generation of kink-antikink pairs through the excitation of an oscillon in the $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the oscillon decay in a model with a single scalar field and two asymmetric fundamental states. Specifically, we verify how the evolution of an initially excited oscillon leads to the formation of antikink-kink pairs in the presence of a centered long-lived pulse. In such a context, the magnitude of the original perturbation stands for the most important factor influencing the process. For intermediary values of this magnitude, we find a transitory behavior which suggests that the energy exchange between translational and vibrational modes begins to play an important role in the overall evolution. As the magnitude increases, the centered pulse intermediates an interaction between the inner structures which compose the pairs whose behavior mimics that of a standard antikink-kink collision and therefore reinforces the role played by the energy transfer mechanism. We depict the resulting resonant structure and note that it mimics that of an usual kink-antikink scattering. We also reproduce some of our results now via an initial lumplike perturbation proposed as a kink-antikink pair. For different values of width, {\it{an almost pure}} antikink-kink pair escapes to the infinity after multiple bounces.</description>

Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

Abstract: The leading $(\alpha')^3$-correction to the gravitational low-energy effective action of closed (type II) superstring theory in four-spacetime dimensions defines the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity action that is applied for a calculation of the leading corrections to the Schwarzschild solution and the Hubble function in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, in the first order with respect to the effective string-generated coupling. The solutions found are compared to the corresponding solutions in the Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity that also modifies the Einstein gravity by the terms quartic in the spacetime curvature. We consider the black hole shadows in the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity theory and derive the upper bound on the string coupling parameter from the Hawking temperature of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact quantum observable analog of the weak equivalence principle for a `relativistic' quantum particle. The quantum geodesic equations are obtained from Heisenberg equations of motion as an exact analog of a fully covariant classical Hamiltonian evolution picture, with the proper identification of the canonical momentum variables as $p_\mu$, rather than $p^\mu$. We discuss the meaning of the equations in relation to projective measurements as well as equations with solution curves as ones in the noncommutative geometric picture of spacetime, and a plausible approach to quantum gravity as a theory about quantum observables as physical quantities including the notion of quantum coordinate transformation.</description>

      <title>Spacetime quantum and classical mechanics with dynamical foliation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional phase space of classical physics treats space and time differently, and this difference carries over to field theories and quantum mechanics (QM). In this paper, the phase space is enhanced through two main extensions. First, we promote the time choice of the Legendre transform to a dynamical variable. Second, we extend the Poisson brackets of matter fields to a spacetime symmetric form. The ensuing "spacetime phase space" is employed to obtain an explicitly covariant version of Hamilton equations for relativistic field theories. A canonical-like quantization of the formalism is then presented in which the fields satisfy spacetime commutation relations and the foliation is quantum. In this approach, the classical action is also promoted to an operator and retains explicit covariance through its non-separability in the matter-foliation partition. The problem of establishing a correspondence between the new noncausal framework (where fields at different times are independent) and conventional QM is solved through a generalization of spacelike correlators to spacetime. In this generalization, the Hamiltonian is replaced by the action, and conventional particles by off-shell particles. When the foliation is quantized, the previous map is recovered by conditioning on foliation eigenstates, in analogy with the Page and Wootters mechanism. We also provide an interpretation of the correspondence in which the causal structure of a given theory emerges from the quantum correlations between the system and an environment. This idea holds for general quantum systems and allows one to generalize the density matrix to an operator containing the information of correlators both in space and time.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-loop helicity amplitudes for the scattering of five gluons, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are represented as linear combinations of transcendental functions with rational coefficients, which we reconstruct from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. Guided by the requirement of removing unphysical singularities, we find a remarkably compact generating set of rational coefficients, which we are able to display entirely in the manuscript. We implement our results in a public code, which provides efficient and reliable numerical evaluations for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Toward a classification of PT-symmetric quantum systems: From dissipative dynamics to topology and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of many-body non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems are attracting a lot of interest due to their relevance in research areas ranging from quantum optics and continuously monitored dynamics to Euclidean wormholes in quantum gravity and dissipative quantum chaos. While a symmetry classification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we show that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24 universality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis using exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in 4 of these 14 universality classes, AIII$_\nu$, BDI$^\dagger_\nu$, BDI$_{++\nu}$, and CI$_{--\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block structure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ the difference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that this feature leads to the existence of $\nu$ robust purely \emph{real} eigenvalues, whose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory for classes A, AI, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that this $\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By contrast, nontopological real eigenvalues display a crossover between Hermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of Lindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected results, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the theory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different sectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory. Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one dimension.</description>

Abstract: We complete the computation of two-loop helicity amplitudes required to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for three-jet production at hadron colliders, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are reconstructed from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. We find that the reconstruction is significantly facilitated by exploiting the overlaps between rational coefficient functions of quark and gluon processes, and we display their compact generating sets in the appendix of the paper. We implement our results in a public code, and demonstrate its suitability for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical 1-loop correction from a potential yielding ultra-slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of inflation might lead to amplified scalar fluctuations on small scales due, for example, to a transient ultra-slow-roll phase. It was argued by Kristiano $\&amp;$ Yokoyama in arXiv:2211.03395 that the enhanced amplitude of the scalar power spectrum on small scales has the potential to induce a sizeable 1-loop correction to the spectrum at large scales. In this work, we repeat the calculation for the 1-loop correction presented in arXiv:2211.03395. We closely follow their assumptions but evaluate the loop numerically. This allows us to consider both instantaneous and smooth transitions between the slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll phases. In particular, we generate models featuring realistic, smooth evolution from an analytic inflationary potential. We find that, upon fixing the amplitude of the peak in the power spectrum at short scales, the resulting 1-loop correction is not significantly reduced by considering a smooth evolution. In particular, for a power spectrum with a tree-level peak amplitude potentially relevant for small-scale phenomenology, e.g. primordial black hole production, the 1-loop correction on large scales is a few percent of the tree-level power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularities and black holes from transmutation of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <title>Topological interpretation of extremal and Davies-type phase transitions of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological arguments are currently being used as a novel scheme to discern the properties of black holes while ignoring their detailed structure and specific field equations. Among various avenues of black hole physics, where this novel approach is being utilized, the phase transition in black hole thermodynamics lies at the forefront. There are several types of phase transition in black holes; such as the van der Waals type phase transition, Davies-type phase transition, extremal phase transition, and Hawking-Page (HP) transition. So far, the topological interpretation, where the critical point has been identified with the non-zero topological charge, has been obtained only for the van der Waals type phase transition and HP transition in different spacetimes. To complete the picture, here we provide the same interpretation for two other phase transitions: Davies-type phase transition and extremal phase transition. The entire analysis is general and is valid for any spacetime where these types of phase transitions are observed. More importantly, our analysis suggests that amid the apparent differences in these phase transitions, they share the same topological characteristics, \textit{i.e.} non-zero topological charge arising from different thermodynamic potentials in different types of phase transition.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Vortex Phase and Magnetic Field Generation in QCD with Isospin and Baryon Chemical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryonic vortex phase in low energy dense QCD with finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate emerges as a ground state at finite isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex with the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, once we take into account a modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a vortex-Skyrmion state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We further reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies that the phase, in which such vortices emerge spontaneously without an external magnetic field, would take over the ground state at high baryon density. Such a new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and relates to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Holography for Sp(2$N_c$) Gauge Dynamics: from Composite Higgs to Technicolour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel prescription for the expression of the thermodynamic potentials associated with the couplings of a Lanczos-Lovelock theory. These potentials emerge in theories with multiple couplings, where the ratio between them provide intrinsic length scales that break scale invariance. Our prescription, derived from the covariant phase space formalism, differs from previous approaches by enabling the construction of finite potentials without reference to any background. To do so, we consistently work with finite-size systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions and rigorously take into account boundary and corner terms: including these terms is found to be crucial for relaxing the integrability conditions for phase space quantities that were required in previous works. We apply this prescription to the first law of (extended) thermodynamics for stationary black holes, and derive a version of the Smarr formula that holds for static black holes with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.</description>
