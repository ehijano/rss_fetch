      <title>Variational quantum and neural quantum states algorithms for the linear complementarity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.</description>

      <title>A 120 lines code for isogeometric topology optimization and its extension to 3D in MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a compact and efficient code implementation is presented for isogeometric topology optimization (ITO) approach. With the aid of B\.ezier extraction technique, a derived explicit stiffness matrix computation formula is applied to all B-spline IGA elements with rectangular shape under linear elasticity assumption. Using the aforementioned explicit formula, the stiffness matrix calculation and updating of IGA are significantly simplified, which leads to the current ITO code implemented only in one main function without calling subroutines, such as IGA mesh generation and Gaussian quadrature. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases are taken into consideration, which result into iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 MATLAB codes for 2D and 3D design problems. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of our open-source codes, with several user-defined input parameters basically identical to those used in top88 and top3D. Therefore, iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 provide an effective entry for the code transforming from FEM-based TO into ITO.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for the UAV Path Planning with Object Coverage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) such that a specific set of objects needs to be observed while ensuring a quality of observation. Our goal is to determine the shortest path for the UAV. This paper proposes an offline algorithm with an approximation of $(2+2n)(1+\epsilon)$ where $\epsilon &gt;0$ is a small constant, and $n$ is the number of objects. We then propose several online algorithms in which objects are discovered during the process. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, we conduct experimental comparisons. Our results show that the online algorithms perform similarly to the offline algorithm, but with significantly faster execution times ranging from 0.01 seconds to 200 seconds. We also show that our methods yield solutions with costs comparable to those obtained by the Gurobi optimizer that requires 30000 seconds of runtime.</description>

      <title>Control Co-Design Under Uncertainty for Offshore Wind Farms: Optimizing Grid Integration, Energy Storage, and Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Model conditioned on monitoring features for estimation and uncertainty quantification in engineered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced Order Models (ROMs) form essential tools across engineering domains by virtue of their function as surrogates for computationally intensive digital twinning simulators. Although purely data-driven methods are available for ROM construction, schemes that allow to retain a portion of the physics tend to enhance the interpretability and generalization of ROMs. However, physics-based techniques can adversely scale when dealing with nonlinear systems that feature parametric dependencies. This study introduces a generative physics-based ROM that is suited for nonlinear systems with parametric dependencies and is additionally able to quantify the confidence associated with the respective estimates. A main contribution of this work is the conditioning of these parametric ROMs to features that can be derived from monitoring measurements, feasibly in an online fashion. This is contrary to most existing ROM schemes, which remain restricted to the prescription of the physics-based, and usually a priori unknown, system parameters. Our work utilizes conditional Variational Autoencoders to continuously map the required reduction bases to a feature vector extracted from limited output measurements, while additionally allowing for a probabilistic assessment of the ROM-estimated Quantities of Interest. An auxiliary task using a neural network-based parametrization of suitable probability distributions is introduced to re-establish the link with physical model parameters. We verify the proposed scheme on a series of simulated case studies incorporating effects of geometric and material nonlinearity under parametric dependencies related to system properties and input load characteristics.</description>

      <title>Parallel Market Environments for FinRL Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial reinforcement learning has attracted lots of attention recently. From 2023 to 2025, we have organized three FinRL Contests featuring different financial tasks. Large language models have a strong capability to process financial documents. By integrating LLM-generated signals into the state, trading agents can take smarter actions based on both structured market data and unstructured financial documents. In this paper, we summarize the parallel market environments for tasks used in FinRL Contests 2023-2025. To address the sampling bottleneck during training, we introduce GPU-optimized parallel market environments to address the sampling bottleneck. In particular, two new tasks incorporate LLM-generated signals and all tasks support massively parallel simulation. Contestants have used these market environments to train robust and powerful trading agents for both stock and cryptocurrency trading tasks.</description>
