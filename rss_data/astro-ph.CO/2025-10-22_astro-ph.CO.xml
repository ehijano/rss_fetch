      <title>Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structure in Multi-species Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the growth of structure in multi-species wave (and particle) dark matter. We derive the evolution of the power spectrum of total density contrasts for an arbitrary number of component species, density fractions, and initial field power spectra. We also derive cross-spectra for density correlations across or within individual species. Our framework includes cold and warm wave dark matter, which can give rise to significant intrinsic Poisson-like density fluctuations along with scale-dependent evolution connected to the free-streaming and Jeans scales. Such dark matter components could be globally or locally misaligned scalar fields as well as multi-component fields with spin $&gt;0$. The framework also includes cold and warm particle dark matter in the appropriate limits.</description>

      <title>FLAMINGO: Tracing the co-evolution of hot gas and black holes in galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas mass fraction of galaxy groups and clusters is a key physical quantity for constraining the impact of feedback processes on large-scale structure. While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible. For haloes with M500 &lt; 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun &lt; M500 &lt; 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that can be tested with future observational measurements.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shear with one component and its application to future radio surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to measuring cosmic shear: the one-component Kinematic Lensing (KL) method. This technique provides a simplified implementation of KL that reduces shape noise in weak lensing (WL) by combining kinematic information with imaging data, while requiring less observational effort than the full two-component KL. We perform simulated likelihood analyses to assess the performance of the one-component KL and demonstrate its applicability to future radio surveys. Our forecasts indicate that, for radio surveys, the one-component KL is not yet competitive with traditional WL due to the shallow redshift distribution of HI-selected galaxies. However, when applying this method to deeper spectroscopic surveys with stronger emission lines, the one-component KL approach could surpass WL in constraining power, offering a promising and efficient pathway for future shear analyses.</description>

      <title>Can the CMB be Odd? Effect of a Parity-Violating Matter 4-Point Function on the Low-$\ell$ CMB Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we explore from a theoretical perspective the sensitivity of the primary CMB anisotropy trispectrum to parity violation (PV) in large-scale structure (LSS). We focus on the Sachs-Wolfe term, which dominates at $\ell &lt; 40$, after which the Doppler term takes over. We consider a model where the PV is only present out to some maximal scale $R$ of order a few hundred Mpc/$h$, consistent with what recent LSS 4PCF measurements seem to indicate. We find that the odd CMB trispectrum must be suppressed by at least one factor of $R/\chi_*$$\simeq$1\%, with $\chi_*$ the distance to last scattering, relative to the input matter 4PCF. Thus, a non-detection of PV in the CMB trispectrum is \textit{not necessarily inconsistent} with a genuine detection of PV in the LSS 4PCF.</description>

      <title>The thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters and filaments using multifrequency temperature maps of the cosmic microwave background: Abell 399--Abell 401 cluster pair case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multifrequency and multi-instrument methodology to study the physical properties of galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments using cosmic microwave background observations. Our approach enables simultaneous measurement of both the thermal (tSZ) and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effects, incorporates relativistic corrections, and models astrophysical foregrounds such as thermal dust emission. We do this by jointly fitting a single physical model across multiple maps from multiple instruments at different frequencies, rather than fitting a model to a single Compton-$y$ map. We demonstrate the success of this method by fitting the Abell 399-Abell 401 galaxy cluster pair and filament system using archival data from the Planck satellite and new, targeted deep data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, covering 11 different frequencies over 14 maps from 30 GHz to 545 GHz. Our tSZ results are consistent with previous work using Compton-$y$ maps. We measure the line-of-sight peculiar velocities of the cluster-filament system using the kSZ effect and find statistical uncertainties on individual cluster peculiar velocities of $\lesssim $600 km s$^{-1}$, which are competitive with current state-of-the-art measurements. Additionally, we measure the optical depth of the filament component with a signal-to-noise of 8.5$\sigma$ and reveal hints of its morphology. This modular approach is well-suited for application to future instruments across a wide range of millimeter and sub-millimeter wavebands.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF-11: A New Zodiacal Light Model Optimized for Optical Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.</description>

      <title>The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ Forecasts and the search for primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ line-intensity mock maps and forecast the capabilities of upcoming wide-field submillimeter-wave surveys of cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Using the $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ algorithm to generate light-cone dark matter (DM) halo catalogues and the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ framework to forward-model the cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ signal, we construct tomographic mock surveys matched to the CCAT Observatory. We investigate both astrophysical models of $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from interstellar gas and the potential for the study of primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity (PING) as a science case for Stage 2 line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. The $\mathrm{[CII]}$ voxel intensity distribution (VID) is used as a summary statistic in forecasts. Additional constraints on PING are derived from a relative entropy study of $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo mass functions. We show that upcoming LIM surveys will provide insights into the way we model cosmological line emission, and next-generation surveys can place competitive bounds on novel inflationary scenarios such as PING. The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ mocks and corresponding $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo catalogues are publicly available at https://uoft.me/webskycii .</description>

      <title>The implications of inflation for the last ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored a parameterized slow-roll inflationary model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework, utilizing a combination of data from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and BICEP/Keck 2018 (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Additionally, we incorporated the SH0ES prior on $H_0$ (P-ACT-LB-BK18-$H_0$) to analyze the model within the early dark energy (EDE) framework. While the model with a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^\alpha$ for small values of $\alpha$ still fits the data, the Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation falls outside the $2\sigma$ region. On the other hand, in a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, higher-order corrections to $R$ are typically anticipated. In response, we proposed a non-perturbative exponential $f(R)$ inflation model, wherein the subleading corrections beyond $R^2$ including terms like $R^3$ or $R^4$. Using numerical calculations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the P-ACT-LB-BK18 data set, we demonstrate that this model can align well with the ACT-preferred value of the scalar spectral index. Additionally, within the early dark energy (EDE) framework, it accommodates greater deviations from the original Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation model when incorporating the SH0ES prior on $H_0$.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: towards a consistent universal pressure profile and cluster mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a self-similar paradigm of structure formation, the thermal pressure of the hot intra-cluster gas follows a universal distribution once the profile of each cluster is normalised based on the proper mass and redshift dependencies. The reconstruction of such a universal pressure profile requires an individual estimate of the mass of each cluster. In this context, we present a method to jointly fit, for the first time, the universal pressure profile and individual cluster $M_{500}$ masses over a sample of galaxy clusters, properly accounting for correlations between the profile shape and amplitude, and masses scaling the individual profiles. We demonstrate the power of the method and show that a consistent exploitation of the universal pressure profile and cluster mass estimates when modelling the thermal pressure in clusters is necessary to avoid biases. In particular, the method, informed by a cluster mass scale, outputs individual cluster masses with same accuracy and better precision than input masses. Using data from the {\guillemotleft}Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton: Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation{\guillemotright}, we investigate a sample of $\sim 25$ galaxy clusters spanning mass and redshift ranges of $2 \lesssim M_{500}/10^{14} \; \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \lesssim 14$ and $0.07 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: forecast on the primordial power spectrum reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the J-PAS survey to constrain the primordial power spectrum using a non-parametric Bayesian method. Specifically, we analyze simulated power spectra generated by a local oscillatory primordial feature template motivated by non-standard inflation. The feature is placed within the range of scales where the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized, and we restrict the analysis to $k \in [0.02,0.2] \text{ h} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$, set by the expected J-PAS coverage and the onset of non-linear effects. Each primordial power spectrum is reconstructed by linearly interpolating $N$ knots in the $\{\log k, \log P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)\}$ plane, which are sampled jointly with the cosmological parameters $\{H_0,\Omega_b h^2, \Omega_c h^2\}$ using PolyChord. To test the primordial features, we apply two statistical tools: the Bayes factor and a hypothesis test that localizes the scales where features are detected. We assess the recovery under different J-PAS specifications, including redshift binning, tracer type, survey area, and filter strategy. Our results show that combining redshift bins and tracers allows the detection of oscillatory features as small as 2\%.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from relativistic $N$-body Simulations: $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM versus $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present relativistic $N$-body simulations of a $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM - sign-switching cosmological constant (CC) - scenario under general relativity and compare its nonlinear matter power spectrum to $\Lambda$CDM at ${z = 15,\,2,\,1,\,0}$, using best-fit parameters from Planck-only and a combined ''full'' dataset. During the AdS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&lt;0$) phase, prior to the transition redshift $z_\dagger$, reduced Hubble friction dynamically enhances the growth of perturbations; after the switch, with dS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&gt;0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses, but does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio $P_{\Lambda_{\rm s}\rm CDM}/P_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced, redshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\sim 20-25\%}$ around ${k \simeq 1-3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates to larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\sim 15-20\%}$ uplift at ${k \simeq 0.6-1.0\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These wavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the sensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and tSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by a scale-independent change in $\sigma_8$ or $S_8$. The timing (earlier for Planck-only, later for the full dataset) and the amplitude of the crest align with the ''cosmic noon'' epoch (${z \simeq 1-2}$), offering a gravitational prior for the observed peak in the cosmic star-formation rate.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses Without Sacrificing Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</description>

      <title>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.</description>

      <title>$B$-sure I: Minkowski functionals as robustness test for tensor-to-scalar ratio detection from CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial $B$-mode polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major observational goal in modern Cosmology, offering a potential window into inflationary physics through the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses significant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we explore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test to validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features associated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as observed by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and foregrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind component separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used to generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared with those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by component separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results demonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can not be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as we find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant warnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground residuals. In the most realistic and refined scenario we adopted, the test is able to flag non-Gaussianity in $\sim 26\%$ of the simulations, meaning that there is no warning on the biased tensor-to-scalar ratio in $\sim 74\%$ of cases. These results suggest that more advanced statistics than MFs must be considered to look for non-Gaussian signatures of foregrounds, in order to be able to perform reliable null tests in future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Comission Femmes et Astronomie de la SF2A : Women participation in french astronomy 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021, which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees). This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about 57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority, qualification level, and salary.</description>

      <title>AION-1: Omnimodal Foundation Model for Astronomical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While foundation models have shown promise across a variety of fields, astronomy still lacks a unified framework for joint modeling across its highly diverse data modalities. In this paper, we present AION-1, a family of large-scale multimodal foundation models for astronomy. AION-1 integrates heterogeneous imaging, spectroscopic, and scalar data using a two-stage architecture: modality-specific tokenization followed by transformer-based masked modeling of cross-modal token sequences. The model is pretrained on five large-scale surveys: Legacy Survey, Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Gaia. These span more than 200 million observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars. With a single frozen encoder, AION-1 achieves strong results on a broad suite of downstream tasks, including galaxy and stellar property estimation, galaxy morphology classification, similarity-based retrieval, galaxy image segmentation, and spectral super-resolution. We release AION-1 model variants ranging from 300 M to 3.1 B parameters. Beyond astronomy, AION-1 provides a scalable blueprint for multimodal scientific foundation models that can seamlessly integrate noisy, instrument-specific observations. All code, tokenizers, pretrained weights, and a lightweight evaluation suite are released under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), beyond the current JWST detection limits ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of $\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by $\sim20-40\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near $M_\star$ $\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\odot$ or $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \sim -10$ at $z \gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim -15$ to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction ($\sim50\%$) of streams with $M_\star$ $\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie-Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by interconversion $\chi_1\chi_1 \to \chi_2\chi_2$ - determine the relic abundance analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20 - 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster upper bounds $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m &lt; 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and ``little red dots''; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and astrophysical requirements.</description>

      <title>Variance of dust temperature and spectral index in Planck polarization data using spin-moment expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal dust is the major polarized foreground hindering the detection of primordial CMB B-modes. Its signal presents a complex behavior in frequency space inherited from the joint variation in our Galaxy of the orientation of magnetic fields and of the spectral properties of dust grains aligned with magnetic field lines. In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing the thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual maps, represented as complex quantities, that capture deviations of the local polarized SED from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We make simple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and covariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the emitting aligned grains. The validation or falsification of these predictions provide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal. We confront our predictions with Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic plane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the statistical properties of the data. The spectral dependence of the covariances between residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a dust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index variations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck official release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision polarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB community.</description>

      <title>The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the "tension" and "compatibility" scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Attractor Models of Inflation and Reheating from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) data, focusing on their implications for attractor models of inflation. We compare systematically observational bounds with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\alpha$-Starobinsky) and T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with $\alpha \lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\alpha = 1$) predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 - 10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95% confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility. T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\alpha \lesssim 11$ in these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $\alpha$-attractors with monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum, demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 - 0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6 data. We also consider deformed E- and T-models, which allow significantly higher values of $n_s$ for low values of $\alpha \simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley'' structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the CosmoDC2 LSST synthetic catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum quadratic gravity inflationary scenario that can accommodate the new cosmological constraints, which have disfavored Starobinsky inflation. The theory is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet, but 1-loop running is found to dynamically lead to slow-roll inflation toward the infrared. When a large number of matter fields contribute to the beta functions, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be phenomenologically viable. We find that as inflation ends, the theory approaches its strong coupling regime and general relativity must emerge, as an effective field theory, as the universe must reheat and enter its standard radiation era. In order to avoid strong coupling, a minimum tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.01 is predicted for this theory. Our framework offers a laboratory for connecting a concrete ultraviolet completion (quantum quadratic gravity) with inflationary dynamics, reheating, and precise cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy formation with wave/fuzzy dark matter: The core-halo structure and the solitonic imprint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter-dominated cores have long been claimed for the well-studied local group dwarf galaxies. More recently, extended stellar halos have been uncovered around several of these dwarfs through deeper imaging and spectroscopy. Such core-halo structures are not a feature of conventional cold dark matter (CDM). In contrast, smooth and prominent dark matter cores are predicted for wave/fuzzy dark matter ($\psi$DM). The question arises as to what extent the visible stellar profiles should reflect this dark matter core structure. Here we compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of CDM, ``WDM'' (model used as a proxy for $\psi$DM) \&amp; $\psi$DM, aiming to predict the stellar profiles for these three DM scenarios. We show that cores surrounded by extended halos are distinguishable for $\psi$DM, where the stellar density is enhanced in the core due to the presence of the relatively dense soliton. Our analysis demonstrates that, in our simulations, a distinctive core-halo structure does not appear in the case of CDM in the DM, gas, or stars. Whereas we do find a core-halo transition for DM, gas, and stars for $\psi$DM, and the scale of this transition is in line with the predicted core radius set by the soliton scale anticipated for the adopted boson mass of 2.5$\times10^{-22}$eV. The presence of a core-halo structure in the stellar profile for Galaxy 1 for $\psi$DM is visible for the most massive and the first galaxy to form in the simulation. Clearly, further simulations are needed to establish how strict this possible relationship is between the DM and stellar core-halo profile as a potential observational discriminator. Furthermore, we observe the anticipated asymmetry for $\psi$DM due to the soliton's motion (jumping and random walk), a distinctive characteristic not found in the symmetric distributions of stars in the warm and CDM models.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project I: A new weak lensing shape catalog of 107 million galaxies</title>

Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. This catalog was assembled from public DECam data including survey and standard observing programs. These data were consistently processed with the Dark Energy Survey Data Management pipeline as part of the DECADE campaign and serve as the basis of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We apply the Metacalibration measurement algorithm to generate and calibrate galaxy shapes. After cuts, the resulting cosmology-ready galaxy shape catalog covers a region of $5,\!412 \,\,{\rm deg}^2$ with an effective number density of $4.59\,\, {\rm arcmin}^{-2}$. The coadd images used to derive this data have a median limiting magnitude of $r = 23.6$, $i = 23.2$, and $z = 22.6$, estimated at ${\rm S/N} = 10$ in a 2 arcsecond aperture. We present a suite of detailed studies to characterize the catalog, measure any residual systematic biases, and verify that the catalog is suitable for cosmology analyses. In parallel, we build an image simulation pipeline to characterize the remaining multiplicative shear bias in this catalog, which we measure to be $m = (-2.454 \pm 0.124) \times10^{-2}$ for the full sample. Despite the significantly inhomogeneous nature of the data set, due to it being an amalgamation of various observing programs, we find the resulting catalog has sufficient quality to yield competitive cosmological constraints.</description>

Abstract: We present the photometric redshift characterization and calibration for the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The redshifts are estimated from a combination of wide-field photometry, deep-field photometry with associated redshift estimates, and a transfer function between the wide field and deep field that is estimated using a source injection catalog. We construct four tomographic bins for the galaxy catalog, and estimate the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, within each one using the Self-organizing Map Photo-Z (SOMPZ) methodology. Our estimates include the contributions from sample variance, zeropoint calibration uncertainties, and redshift biases, as quantified for the deep-field dataset. The total uncertainties on the mean redshifts are $\sigma_{\langle z \rangle} \approx 0.01$. The SOMPZ estimates are then compared to those from the clustering redshift method, obtained by cross-correlating our source galaxies with galaxies in spectroscopic surveys, and are shown to be consistent with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the pipeline for the cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog consisting of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The catalog derives from a large number of disparate observing programs and is therefore more inhomogeneous across the sky compared to existing lensing surveys. First, we use simulated data-vectors to show the sensitivity of our constraints to different analysis choices in our inference pipeline, including sensitivity to residual systematics. Next we use simulations to validate our covariance modeling for inhomogeneous datasets. Finally, we show that our choices in the end-to-end cosmic shear pipeline are robust against inhomogeneities in the survey, by extracting relative shifts in the cosmology constraints across different subsets of the footprint/catalog and showing they are all consistent within $1\sigma$ to $2\sigma$. This is done for forty-six subsets of the data and is carried out in a fully consistent manner: for each subset of the data, we re-derive the photometric redshift estimates, shear calibrations, survey transfer functions, the data vector, measurement covariance, and finally, the cosmological constraints. Our results show that existing analysis methods for weak lensing cosmology can be fairly resilient towards inhomogeneous datasets. This also motivates exploring a wider range of image data for pursuing such cosmological constraints.</description>

Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) cosmic shear analysis. This work uses shape measurements for 107 million galaxies measured through Dark Energy Camera (DECam) imaging of $5,\!412$ deg$^2$ of sky that is outside the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint. We derive constraints on the cosmological parameters $S_8 = 0.791^{+0.027}_{-0.032}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} =0.269^{+0.034}_{-0.050}$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which are consistent with those from other weak lensing surveys and from the cosmic microwave background. We combine our results with cosmic shear results from DES Y3 at the likelihood level, since the two datasets span independent areas on the sky. The combined measurements, which cover $\approx\! 10,\!000$ deg$^2$, prefer $S_8 = 0.791 \pm 0.023$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.277^{+0.034}_{-0.046}$ under the $\Lambda$CDM model. These results are the culmination of a series of rigorous studies that characterize and validate the DECADE dataset and the associated analysis methodologies (Anbajagane et. al 2025a,b,c). Overall, the DECADE project demonstrates that the cosmic shear analysis methods employed in Stage-III weak lensing surveys can provide robust cosmological constraints for fairly inhomogeneous datasets. This opens the possibility of using data that have been previously categorized as ``unusable'' for cosmic shear analyses, thereby increasing the statistical power of upcoming weak lensing surveys.</description>

Abstract: We present the redshift calibration methodology and bias estimates for the cosmic shear analysis of the fifth and final data release (DR5) of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). KiDS-DR5 includes a greatly expanded compilation of calibrating spectra, drawn from $27$ square degrees of dedicated optical and near-IR imaging taken over deep spectroscopic fields. The redshift distribution calibration leverages a range of new methods and updated simulations to produce the most precise $N(z)$ bias estimates used by KiDS to date. Improvements to our colour-based redshift distribution measurement method (SOM) mean that we are able to use many more sources per tomographic bin for our cosmological analyses, and better estimate the representation of our source sample given the available spec-$z$. We validate our colour-based redshift distribution estimates with spectroscopic cross-correlations (CC). We find that improvements to our cross-correlation redshift distribution measurement methods mean that redshift distribution biases estimated between the SOM and CC methods are fully consistent on simulations, and the data calibration is consistent to better than $2\sigma$ in all tomographic bins.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Cosmological constraints from cosmic shear with the complete Kilo-Degree Survey</title>

Abstract: We present cosmic shear constraints from the completed Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), where the cosmological parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.815^{+0.016}_{-0.021}$, is found to be in agreement ($0.73\sigma$) with results from the Planck Legacy cosmic microwave background experiment. The final KiDS footprint spans $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging across the optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square degrees of KiDS-like calibration observations of deep spectroscopic surveys. Improvements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha = 0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We adopt a new physically motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the galaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and that is informed by previous direct alignment measurements. We also marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Comparing to previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase seen in $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution estimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and improved image reduction.

(submitted) presents a full suite of internal and external consistency tests, finding the KiDS-Legacy data set to be the most internally robust sample produced by KiDS to date.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on superconducting cosmic strings in light of Dark Ages global 21-cm signal</title>

Abstract: The Superconducting Cosmic Strings (SCS) are a special case of cosmic strings that have a core carrying a charged field. When SCS passes through magnetized regions, the charged particles in the string experience a Lorentz force, which can produce radiation on the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation can inject energy into the surrounding plasma, resulting in a modification of the thermal and ionization evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and, subsequently, the global 21-cm signal. The signatures of SCS in the post-recombination era have been primarily studied in the low-frequency (radio) regime, which does not impact the state of the IGM. In this work, we study the effect of decaying SCS on the dark ages global 21-cm signal $(\delta T_b)$, considering both the ionizing and radio radiation. The dark ages signal can provide pristine cosmological information free from astrophysical uncertainties, as the universe was primarily homogeneous during this era in the absence of baryonic structure formation. Considering a change in the $\delta T_b$ at redshift $z\sim 89$ from the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ framework, we derive an upper bound on the decay efficiency parameter, $g\equiv g(I,~G\mu_s)$, to be $\lesssim 5.1\times10^{14}\, \rm GeV^2$, where, $I$ and $G\mu_s$ represent the loop current and string tension of SCS, respectively.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Infalling ultra-faint dwarfs as emissaries of the Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) infalling onto the Milky Way, namely Leo K \&amp; M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the case that UFDs constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller and fainter, and metal-poorer than the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark-matter (DM) model. Here, we show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of multiple light bosons representing the ``Axiverse'' proposal of string theory, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFD class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of $3\times 10^{-21}$ eV, including Leo K \&amp; M, whereas a lighter axion of $10^{-22}$ eV comprises the bulk of DM in all larger galaxies including the dSphs. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its velocity dispersion to be smaller $(\simeq 1.7$km/s) than that of Leo K $(\simeq 4.5$km/s) because of the inverse de Broglie scale dependence on momentum. This scenario can be definitively tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing residuals that may be detected by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) on timescales of approximately one week and four months, respectively.</description>

      <title>New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, via analyzing \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB and DESI BAO data combination. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions, assuming a uniform prior for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). In contrast, if a log-uniform prior was assumed for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$, these constraints can become tighter by a factor of $\sim4$, suggesting the results to be prior-sensitive. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints we obtained in this work provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Spin-3/2 Particles During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the density of a spin-$\frac32$ particle, the raritron, produced at the end of inflation due to gravitational interactions. We consider a background inflaton condensate as the source of this production, mediated by the exchange of a graviton. This production greatly exceeds the gravitational production from the emergent thermal bath during reheating. The relic abundance limit sets an absolute minimum mass for a stable raritron, though there are also model dependent constraints imposed by unitarity. We also examine the case of gravitational production of a gravitino, taking into account the goldstino evolution during reheating. We compare these results with conventional gravitino production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by Very Large Array (VLA) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis conservatively rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with $99.5^{+0.5}_{-8.2}$$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, M_\odot \, \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, M_\odot \, \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $&lt; 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 &lt; M_{\rm VMS} \, [M_\odot] &lt; 5\times10^4$ within $&lt;1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.</description>
