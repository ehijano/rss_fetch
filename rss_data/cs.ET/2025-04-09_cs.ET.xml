      <title>Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum-Inspired Solvers: A Preliminary Study on the Weighted Max-Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is essential across numerous disciplines. Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Sensing in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate severe path losses in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. In particular, these techniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined beam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and beam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and communications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential use in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor devices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The proposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19% accuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to existing been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time overheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled communications.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting solar panel power output is crucial for advancing the transition to renewable energy but is complicated by the variable and non-linear nature of solar energy. This is influenced by numerous meteorological factors, geographical positioning, and photovoltaic cell properties, posing significant challenges to forecasting accuracy and grid stability. Our study introduces a suite of solutions centered around hybrid quantum neural networks designed to tackle these complexities. The first proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory, surpasses all tested models by achieving mean absolute errors and mean squared errors that are more than 40% lower. The second proposed model, the Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence neural network, once trained, predicts photovoltaic power with 16% lower mean absolute error for arbitrary time intervals without the need for prior meteorological data, highlighting its versatility. Moreover, our hybrid models perform better even when trained on limited datasets, underlining their potential utility in data-scarce scenarios. These findings represent progress towards resolving time series prediction challenges in energy forecasting through hybrid quantum models, showcasing the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in catalyzing the renewable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Decoding Brain Dynamics in Motor Planning Based on EEG Microstates for Predicting Pedestrian Road-Crossing in Vehicle-to-Everything Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pedestrians who cross roads, often emerge from occlusion or abruptly begin crossing from a standstill, frequently leading to unintended collisions with vehicular traffic that result in accidents and interruptions. Existing studies have predominantly relied on external network sensing and observational data to anticipate pedestrian motion. However, these methods are post hoc, reducing the vehicles' ability to respond in a timely manner. This study addresses these gaps by introducing a novel data stream and analytical framework derived from pedestrians' wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to predict motor planning in road crossings. Experiments were conducted where participants were embodied in a visual avatar as pedestrians and interacted with varying traffic volumes, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals. To understand how human cognitive modules flexibly interplay with hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization, we analyzed time-frequency representation and functional connectivity using collected EEG signals and constructed a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model to decompose EEG sequences into cognitive microstate transitions based on posterior probabilistic reasoning. Subsequently, datasets were constructed using a sliding window approach, and motor readiness was predicted using the K-nearest Neighbors algorithm combined with Dynamic Time Warping. Results showed that high-beta oscillations in the frontocentral cortex achieved an Area Under the Curve of 0.91 with approximately a 1-second anticipatory lead window before physical road crossing movement occurred. These preliminary results signify a transformative shift towards pedestrians proactively signaling their motor intentions to autonomous vehicles within intelligent V2X systems. The proposed framework is also adaptable to various human-robot interactions, enabling seamless collaboration in dynamic mobile environments.</description>
