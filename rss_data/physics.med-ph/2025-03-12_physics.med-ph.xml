      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop 5T-SRIS, an improved 5T myocardial T1 mapping method based on MOLLI, which addresses limitations in inversion efficiency, readout perturbations, and imperfect magnetization recovery. Methods: The proposed 5T-SRIS method is based on a modified 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence with ECG gating and gradient echo readout. To improve inversion efficiency at 5T, the inversion pulse was redesigned using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. Signal evolution was modeled recursively with inversion efficiency and a correction factor (C) to correct inversion imperfections, and T1 values were estimated via nonlinear optimization. The method was validated in phantom studies, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients at 5T. Results: The optimized IR pulse based on the tangent/hyperbolic tangent pulse was found to outperform the conventional hyperbolic secant IR pulse at the 5T scanner. This optimized IR pulse achieves an average inversion factor of 0.9014within a B0 range of 250Hz and a B1 range of -50% to 20%. Phantom studies show that the 5T-SRIS achieved high accuracy with errors within 5%. In vivo studies with 21 healthy volunteers, the native myocardial T1 values were 1468 ms (apex), 1514 ms (middle), and 1545 ms (base). In vivo studies with 9 heart patients, the native myocardial T1 values were 1484 ms (apex), 1532 ms (middle), and 1581 ms (base). And the post myocardial T1 values were 669 ms (apex), 698 ms (middle), and 675 ms (base). Conclusion: The 5T-SRIS technique is robust and suitable for clinical cardiac imaging. This study demonstrates its feasibility for accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T, despite challenges related to magnetic field inhomogeneity.

      <title>Identification and Removal of System-Induced Autofluorescence in Miniaturized Fiber-optic Fluorescence Endoscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturized fiber-optic fluorescence endoscopes play a crucial role in medical diagnostics and research, but system-induced autofluorescence remains a significant challenge, particularly in single-fiber setups. While recent advances, such as double-clad fiber (DCF) and DCF couplers, have reduced background noise, complete elimination remains challenging. Research on the various sources of system-induced autofluorescence and the methods to remove them are scarce. This study seeks to fulfill this need by proposing practical approaches to removal of system-induced autofluorescence. This study presents the methods to suppress static background noise and proposes an algorithm based on least-squares linear spectral unmixing to remove variable system-induced autofluorescence artifacts. The algorithm was evaluated on a single-fiber DCF intravascular imaging system, with phantom and rodent in vivo experiments confirming its effectiveness. Results showed accurate differentiation between true sample fluorescence and system-induced autofluorescence artifacts through the validation with optical coherence tomography images and histology results, further verified by statistical analysis. Unlike simple background subtraction, the method addresses dynamic variations in background noise and incidental artifacts, providing robust performance under varying conditions. Our method may be adapted to various fiber-based endoscopy setups and be compatible with different fluorescent agents and autofluorescence imaging, broadening its applicability in biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Segmentation-Guided CT Synthesis with Pixel-Wise Conformal Uncertainty Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate dose calculations in proton therapy rely on high-quality CT images. While planning CTs (pCTs) serve as a reference for dosimetric planning, Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is used throughout Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) to generate sCTs for improved dose calculations. Despite its lower cost and reduced radiation exposure advantages, CBCT suffers from severe artefacts and poor image quality, making it unsuitable for precise dosimetry. Deep learning-based CBCT-to-CT translation has emerged as a promising approach. Still, existing methods often introduce anatomical inconsistencies and lack reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting their clinical adoption. To bridge this gap, we propose STF-RUE, a novel framework integrating two key components. First, STF, a segmentation-guided CBCT-to-CT translation method that enhances anatomical consistency by leveraging segmentation priors extracted from pCTs. Second, RUE, a conformal prediction method that augments predicted CTs with pixel-wise conformal prediction intervals, providing clinicians with robust reliability indicator. Comprehensive experiments using UNet++ and Fast-DDPM on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that STF-RUE significantly improves translation accuracy, as measured by a novel soft-tissue-focused metric designed for precise dose computation. Additionally, STF-RUE provides better-calibrated uncertainty sets for synthetic CT, reinforcing trust in synthetic CTs. By addressing both anatomical fidelity and uncertainty quantification, STF-RUE marks a crucial step toward safer and more effective adaptive proton therapy.

      <title>Direct3{\gamma}: A Pipeline for Direct Three-gamma PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel image reconstruction pipeline for three-gamma (3-{\gamma}) positron emission tomography (PET) aimed at improving spatial resolution and reducing noise in nuclear medicine. The proposed Direct3{\gamma} pipeline addresses the inherent challenges in 3-{\gamma} PET systems, such as detector imperfections and uncertainty in photon interaction points. A key feature of the pipeline is its ability to determine the order of interactions through a model trained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) toolkit, thus providing the necessary information to construct Compton cones which intersect with the line of response (LOR) to provide an estimate of the emission point. The pipeline processes 3-{\gamma} PET raw data, reconstructs histoimages by propagating energy and spatial uncertainties along the LOR, and applies a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine these intermediate images into high-quality reconstructions. To further enhance image quality, the pipeline leverages both supervised learning and adversarial losses, with the latter preserving fine structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that Direct3{\gamma} consistently outperforms conventional 200-ps time-of-flight (TOF) PET in terms of SSIM and PSNR.</description>

      <title>Myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using multi-inversion recovery real-time spoiled GRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an accurate myocardial T1 mapping technique at 5T using Look-Locker-based multiple inversion-recovery with the real-time spoiled gradient echo (GRE) acquisition. Methods: The proposed T1 mapping technique (mIR-rt) samples the recovery of inverted magnetization using the real-time GRE and the images captured during diastole are selected for T1 fitting. Multiple-inversion recoveries are employed to increase the sample size for accurate fitting. Furthermore, the inversion pulse (IR) was tailored for cardiac imaging at 5T, optimized to maximize the inversion efficiency over specified ranges of B1 and off-resonance. The T1 mapping method was validated using Bloch simulation, phantom studies, and in 16 healthy volunteers at 5T. Results: The optimized IR pulse based on the tangent/hyperbolic tangent pulse was found to outperform the conventional hyperbolic secant IR pulse within a limited peak amplitude of 10.6 {\mu}T at the 5T scanner. This optimized IR pulse achieves an average inversion factor of 0.9014 within a B0 range of +/-250Hz and a B1 range of -50% to 20%. In both simulation and phantom studies, the T1 values measured by mIR-rt closely approximate the reference T1 values, with errors less than 3%, while the conventional MOLLI sequence underestimates T1 values. The myocardial T1 values at 5T are 1553 +/- 52 ms, 1531 +/- 53 ms, and 1526 +/- 60 ms (mean +/- standard deviation) at the apex, middle, and base, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed method is feasible for myocardial T1 mapping at 5T and provides better accuracy than the conventional MOLLI sequence.
