      <title>A refined version of the geometrically m-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture for genus 0 curves over finitely generated fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we show a new result on the geometrically $2$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture for genus $0$ curves over finitely generated fields. More precisely, we show that two genus $0$ hyperbolic curves over a finitely generated field $k$ are isomorphic as $k$-schemes (up to Frobenius twists) if and only if the geometrically maximal $2$-step solvable quotients of their \'etale fundamental groups are isomorphic as topological groups over the absolute Galois group of $k$.</description>

      <title>On Adically Complete D-Modules in Characteristic Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (X, O_X) be an algebraic manifold in characteristic 0, or an analytic manifold over \C. A standard theorem says that a left D_X-module M, which is coherent as an O_X-module, is locally free. This theorem has a generalization to the adically complete algebraic setting, in a paper by Ogus from 1973.
  In the present paper we take a new look at the work of Ogus. We provide a detailed proof of the theorem on D-modules, and extend it to the non-noetherian setting. We also give another proof of an interesting result of Ogus about adically complete modules (slightly extended).
  In the Appendix we discuss a related error in a book by Bjork.</description>

      <title>The Hodge structure on the singularity category of a complex hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex affine hypersurface with isolated singularity determined by a homogeneous polynomial, we identify the noncommutative Hodge structure on the periodic cyclic homology of its singularity category with the classical Hodge structure on the primitive cohomology of the associated projective hypersurface. As a consequence, we show that the Hodge conjecture for the projective hypersurface is equivalent to a dg-categorical analogue of the Hodge conjecture for the singularity category.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Lyubeznik numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a Hodge-theoretical refinement of the Lyubeznik numbers for local rings of complex algebraic varieties. We prove that these numbers are independent of the choices made in their definition and that, for the local ring of an isolated singularity, they can be expressed in terms of the Hodge numbers of the cohomology of the link of the singularity. We give examples of isolated singularities with the same Lyubeznik numbers but different Hodge-Lyubeznik numbers.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up formula of the Chow weights for polarized toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety and let $\widetilde{X}$ be the blow-up manifold of $X$ at finitely many distinct tours invariants points of $X$. In this paper, we give an explicit combinatorial formula of the Chow weight of $\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the symplectic cuts of the Delzant polytope. We then apply this blow-up formula to the projective plane and see the difference of Chow stability between the toric blow-up manifolds and the manifolds of blow-ups at general points. Finally, we detect the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant which is an obstruction for asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold.</description>

      <title>Local motivic invariants of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ and $Q$ be two polynomials in two variables with coefficients in an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero. We consider the rational function $f=P/Q$. For an indeterminacy point $\text{x}$ of $f$ and a value $c$, we compute the motivic Milnor fiber $S_{f,\text{x}, c}$ in terms of some motives associated to the faces of the Newton polygons appearing in the Newton algorithms of $P-cQ$ and $Q$ at $\text{x}$, without any condition of non-degeneracy or convenience. In the complex setting, assuming for any $(a,b)\in \mathbb{C}^2$ that $\text{x}$ is smooth or an isolated critical point of $aP+bQ$, and the curves $P=0$ and $Q=0$ do not have common irreducible component, we prove that the topological bifurcation set $\mathscr{B}_{f,\text{x}}^{\text{top}}$ is equal to the motivic bifurcation set $\mathscr{B}_{f,\text{x}}^{\text{mot}}$ and they are computed from the Newton algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Laurent polynomial in two variables is tempered if its edge polynomials are cyclotomic. Variation of coefficients leads to a family of smooth complete genus $g$ curves carrying a canonical algebraic $K_2$-class over a $g$-dimensional base $S$, hence to an extension of admissible variations of MHS (or normal function) on $S$. We prove that the $\mathbb{R}$-split locus of this extension is finite. Consequently, the torsion locus of the normal function and the $A$-polynomial locus for the family of curves are also finite.</description>

      <title>Square values of several polynomials over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_1,\dots,f_m$ be polynomials in $n$ variables with coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We estimate the number of points $\underline{x}$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ such that each value $f_i(\underline{x})$ is a nonzero square in $\mathbb{F}_q$. The error term is especially small when the $f_i$ define smooth projective quadrics with nonsingular intersections. We improve the error term in a recent work by Asgarli--Yip on mutual position of smooth quadrics.</description>

      <title>C-pairs and their morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys Campana's theory of C-pairs (or "geometric orbifolds") in the complex-analytic setting, to serve as a reference for future work. Written with a view towards applications in hyperbolicity, rational points, and entire curves, it introduces the fundamental definitions of C-pair-theory systematically. In particular, it establishes an appropriate notion of "morphism", which agrees with notions from the literature in the smooth case, but is better behaved in the singular setting and has functorial properties that relate it to minimal model theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that log flat torsors over a family $X/S$ of nodal curves under a finite flat commutative group scheme $G/S$ are classified by maps from the Cartier dual of $G$ to the log Jacobian of $X$. We deduce that fppf torsors on the smooth fibres of $X/S$ can be extended to global log flat torsors under some regularity hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory of rigid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To any rigid analytic space (in the sense of Fujiwara-Kato) we assign an $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant rigid analytic homotopy category with coefficients in any presentable category. We show some functorial properties of this assignment as a functor on the category of rigid analytic spaces. Moreover, we show that there exists a full six functor formalism for the precomposition with the analytification functor by evoking Ayoub's thesis. As an application, we identify connective analytic K-theory in the unstable homotopy category with both $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathrm{BGL}$ and the analytification of connective algebraic K-theory. As a consequence, we get a representability statement for coefficients in light condensed spectra.</description>

      <title>Comparing Kahler cone and symplectic cone of one-point blowup of Enriques surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow the study by Cascini-Panov on symplectic generic complex structures on Kahler surfaces with $p_g=0$, a question proposed by Tian-Jun Li, by demonstrating that the one-point blowup of an Enriques surface admits non-Kahler symplectic forms. This phenomenon relies on the abundance of elliptic fibrations on Enriques surfaces, characterized by various invariants from algebraic geometry. We also provide a quantitative comparison of these invariants to further give a detailed examination of the distinction between Kahler cone and symplectic cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an indecomposability criterion of Xun Lin for the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety $X$, we study the paracanonical base locus of $X$, that is the intersection of the base loci of $\omega_X \otimes P_{\alpha}$, for all $\alpha \in \mathrm{Pic}^0 X$. We prove that this is equal to the relative base locus of $\omega_X$ with respect to the Albanese morphism of $X$. As an application, we get that bounded derived categories of Hilbert schemes of points on certain surfaces do not admit non-trivial semi-orthogonal decompositions. We also have a consequence on the indecomposability of bounded derived categories in families. Finally, our viewpoint allows to unify and extend some results recently appearing in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Let $f: S \longrightarrow C$ be a surjective morphism with connected fibers from a smooth complex projective surface $S$ to a smooth complex projective curve $C$ with general fiber $F$. In this paper, we develop a more general version of the slope inequality for data $(D, \mathcal{F})$, where $D$ is an arbitrary relatively effective divisor on $S$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a locally free sub-sheaf of $f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{S}(D)$. We see how the speciality of $D$, restricted to the general fiber, plays a role in the results. Moreover, we compute some natural examples and provide applications.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between solutions to better-behaved GKZ hypergeometric systems near different large radius limit points, and their geometric counterparts given by the $K$-groups of the associated toric Deligne-Mumford stacks. We prove that the $K$-theoretic Fourier-Mukai transforms associated to toric wall-crossing coincide with analytic continuation transformations of Gamma series solutions to the better-behaved GKZ systems, which settles a conjecture of Borisov and Horja.</description>

This local analog consists in computation of the class of $12$th power of the determinant central extension of a group ind-scheme $\mathcal G$ by the multiplicative group scheme over $\mathbb Q$ via the product of $2$-cocyles in the second cohomology group. These $2$-cocycles are the compositions of the Contou-Carr\`{e}re symbol with the $\cup$-product of $1$-cocycles. The group ind-scheme $\mathcal G$ represents the functor which assigns to every commutative ring $A$ the group that is the semidirect product of the group $A((t))^*$ of invertible elements of $A((t))$ and the group of continuous $A$-automorphisms of $A$-algebra $A((t))$. The determinant central extension naturally acts on the determinant line bundle on the moduli stack of geometric data (proper quintets). A proper quintet is a collection of a proper family of curves over $\mathop{\rm Spec} A$, a line bundle on this family, a section of this family, a relative formal parameter at the section, a formal trivialization of the bundle at the section that satisfy further conditions.</description>

      <title>The most symmetric smooth cubic surface over a finite field of characteristic $2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we find the largest automorphism group of a smooth cubic surface over any finite field of characteristic $2.$ We prove that if the order of the field is a power of $4,$ then the automorphism group of maximal order of~a~smooth cubic surface over this field is $\mathrm{PSU}_4(\mathbb{F}_2).$ If the order of the field of characteristic $2$ is not a power of $4,$ then we prove that the automorphism group of maximal order of a smooth cubic surface over this field is the symmetric group of degree $6.$ Moreover, we prove that smooth cubic surfaces with such properties are unique up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,K}$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and $\operatorname{SL}_{2,A}$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positive characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>

      <title>Atomic sheaves on hyper-K\"ahler manifolds via Bridgeland moduli spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide new examples of 1-obstructed and atomic sheaves on an infinite series of locally complete families of projective hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. More precisely,
  (1) we prove that the fixed loci of the natural anti-symplectic involutions on the moduli spaces of stable objects in the Kuznetsov component $\mathcal{K}u(X)$ of a Gushel--Mukai fourfold $X$ are 1-obstructed Lagrangian submanifolds,
  (2) we construct a family of immersed atomic Lagrangian submanifolds on each moduli space of stable objects in $\mathcal{K}u(X)$, and
  (3) we construct non-rigid projectively hyperholomorphic twisted bundles on any hyper-K\"ahler manifold of $\mathrm{K3^{[n]}}$-type for infinitely many $n$.
  Additionally, we discuss examples of atomic Lagrangian submanifolds satisfying $b_1=20$ in a family of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of $\mathrm{K3^{[2]}}$-type, as well as atomic sheaves supported on non-atomic Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Overview on the theory of double flag varieties for symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a connected reductive algebraic group and its symmetric subgroup $ K $. The variety $ \dblFV = K/Q \times G/P $ is called a double flag variety, where $ Q $ and $ P $ are parabolic subgroups of $ K $ and $ G $ respectively.
  In this article, we make a survey on the theory of double flag varieties for a symmetric pair $ (G, K) $ and report entirely new results and theorems on this theory.
  Most important topic is the finiteness of $ K $-orbits on $ \dblFV $. We summarize the classification of $ \dblFV $ of finite type, which are scattered in the literatures. In some respects such classifications are complete, and in some cases not. In particular, we get a classification of double flag varieties of finite type when a symmetric pair is of type AIII, using the theorems of Homma who describes ``indecomposable'' objects of such double flag varieties. Together with these classifications, newly developed embedding theory provides double flag varieties of finite type, which are new. Other ingredients in this article are Steinberg theory, generalization of Robinson-Schensted correspondence, and orbit classification via quiver representations.
  We hope this article is useful for those who want to study the theory of double flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic rank bounds for abelian varieties over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate various categories of equivariant sheaves on the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian in Langlands dual terms. For one, we obtain the factorizable derived geometric Satake theorem. More generally, we calculate the categorical analogue of unramified vectors in the Jacquet module of sheaves on the Grassmannian.
  In all cases, our spectral categories involve factorization modules for factorization algebras related to the Langlands dual group.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler manifolds with quasi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a "pseudo-effective" version of the holonomy principle for compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. As applications, we prove that if a compact complex manifold $M$ admits a K\"{a}hler metric $\omega$ with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature and $(M,\omega)$ has no nonzero truly flat tangent vector at some point (which is satisfied when the holomorphic sectional curvature is quasi-positive), then $M$ is projective and rationally connected. This answers a problem raised up by Matsumura and Yang and extends Yau's conjecture. We also get the structure theorem of a compact simply connected K\"{a}hler manifold with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. Furthermore, we show that a compact K\"{a}hler manifold admits a Hermitian metric with positive real bisectional curvature is a projective and rationally connected manifold.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Ballmann, Matthiesen and Mondal [7], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [31].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\Q$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} \{x_i=x_j\}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively. Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606241</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>
