      <title>Data-Driven Smart Maintenance of Historic Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital transformation in the built environment offers new opportunities to improve building maintenance through data-driven approaches. Smart monitoring, predictive modeling, and artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and enable proactive strategies. The preservation of historic buildings is an important scenario where preventive maintenance is essential to ensure long-term sustainability while protecting heritage values. This thesis presents a comprehensive solution for data-driven smart maintenance of historic buildings, integrating Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, edge computing, ontology-based data modeling, and machine learning to improve indoor climate management, energy efficiency, and conservation practices.
  This thesis advances data-driven conservation of historic buildings by combining smart monitoring, digital twins, and artificial intelligence. The proposed methods enable preventive maintenance and pave the way for the next generation of heritage conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Parameter Tuning Under Uncertain Road Perception in Driver Assistance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems have improved comfort, safety, and efficiency of modern vehicles. However, sensor limitations lead to noisy lane estimates that pose a significant challenge in developing performant control architectures. Lateral trajectory planning often employs an optimal control formulation to maintain lane position and minimize steering effort. The parameters are often tuned manually, which is a time-intensive procedure. This paper presents an automatic parameter tuning method for lateral planning in lane-keeping scenarios based on recorded data, while taking into account noisy road estimates. By simulating the lateral vehicle behavior along a reference curve, our approach efficiently optimizes planner parameters for automated driving and demonstrates improved performance on previously unseen test data.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of an unexpected obstacle without reinforcement learning: Why not using advanced control-theoretic tools?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which "requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Safety-Critical Control of Resilient DC Microgrids with Large-Signal Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies. This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable control in next-generation DC microgrids.</description>

      <title>On the Performance Analysis of Pinching-Antenna-Enabled SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we studies the performance of a novel simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled by a flexible pinching-antenna. To support flexible deployment and optimize energy-rate performance, we propose three practical pinching antenna placement-schemes: the edge deployment scheme (EDS), the center deployment scheme (CDS), and the diagonal deployment scheme (DDS). Moreover, a hybrid time-switching (TS) and power-splitting (PS) protocol is introduced, allowing dynamic adjustment between energy harvesting and information decoding. Under each deployment strategy and the transmission protocol, closed-form expressions for the average harvested energy and average achievable rate of a randomly located user equipment (UE) are derived based on the optimal positioning of the pinching-antenna. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and illustrate the trade-off between rate and energy harvesting under different schemes.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) -- reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Certification of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However, computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Detection of Friction Anomalies in Satellite Reaction Wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of satellites in orbit has increased exponentially in recent years, ensuring their correct functionality has started to require automated methods to decrease human workload. In this work, we present an algorithm that analyzes the on-board data related to friction from the Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) of a satellite and determines their operating status, distinguishing between nominal status and several possible anomalies that require preventive measures to be taken. The algorithm first uses a model based on hybrid systems theory to extract the information relevant to the problem. The extraction process combines techniques in changepoint detection, dynamic programming, and maximum likelihood in a structured way. A classifier then uses the extracted information to determine the status of the RWA. This last classifier has been previously trained with a labelled dataset produced by a high-fidelity simulator, comprised for the most part of nominal data. The final algorithm combines model-based and data-based approaches to obtain satisfactory results with an accuracy around 95%.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Impact Detection and Localization on Forklifts Using Wireless IMU Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forklifts are essential for transporting goods in industrial environments. These machines face wear and tear during field operations, along with rough terrain, tight spaces and complex handling scenarios. This increases the likelihood of unintended impacts, such as collisions with goods, infrastructure, or other machinery. In addition, deliberate misuse has been stated, compromising safety and equipment integrity. This paper presents a low-cost and low-power impact detection system based on multiple wireless sensor nodes measuring 3D accelerations. These were deployed in a measurement campaign covering realworld operational scenarios. An algorithm was developed, based on this collected data, to differentiate high-impact events from normal usage and to localize detected collisions on the forklift. The solution successfully detects and localizes impacts, while maintaining low power consumption, enabling reliable forklift monitoring with multi-year sensor autonomy.</description>

      <title>Remote Estimation for Markov Jump Linear Systems: A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of remote state estimation for Markov jump linear systems in the presence of uncertainty in the posterior mode probabilities. Such uncertainty may arise when the estimator receives noisy or incomplete measurements over an unreliable communication network. To address this challenge, the estimation problem is formulated within a distributionally robust framework, where the true posterior is assumed to lie within a total variation distance ball centered at the nominal posterior. The resulting minimax formulation yields an estimator that extends the classical MMSE solution with additional terms that account for mode uncertainty. A tractable implementation is developed using a distributionally robust variant of the first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian algorithm. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Flows in Complex-valued Directed Networks: Analysis, Design, and Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interdisciplinary field of network science, a complex-valued network, with edges assigned complex weights, provides a more nuanced representation of relationships by capturing both the magnitude and phase of interactions. Additionally, an important application of this setting arises in distribution power grids. Motivated by the richer framework, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving consensus in both strongly and weakly connected digraphs. The paper establishes that complex-valued Laplacian flows converge to consensus subject to an additional constraint termed as real dominance which relies on the phase angles of the edge weights. Our approach builds on the complex Perron-Frobenius properties to study the spectral properties of the Laplacian and its relation to graphical conditions. Finally, we propose modified flows that guarantee consensus even if the original network does not converge to consensus. Additionally, we explore diffusion in complex-valued networks as a dual process of consensus and simulate our results on synthetic and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Sampling-Time Jitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies. We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can be interpreted as a frequency scaling.</description>

      <title>Sailing Towards Zero-Shot State Estimation using Foundation Models Combined with a UKF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However, transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately, developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF, enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via foundation models.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Multiple Control Barrier Functions for Constrained Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Robust Ageing-Aware Control of Li-ion Battery Systems with Data-Driven Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers, and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the closed-loop performance of the cell.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Crew Dispatch for Grid Restoration Following an Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-disaster crew dispatch is a critical but computationally intensive task. Traditional mixed-integer linear programming methods often require minutes to several hours to compute solutions, leading to delays that hinder timely decision-making in highly dynamic restoration environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates transformer architectures with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to deliver near real-time decision support without compromising solution quality. Crew dispatch is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where transformers capture high-dimensional system states and temporal dependencies, while DRL enables adaptive and scalable decision-making. Earthquake-induced distribution network damage is first characterized using established seismic standards, followed by a scenario generation and reduction pipeline that aggregates probable outcomes into a single geospatial impact map. Conditioned on this map, the proposed framework generates second-level dispatch strategies, trained offline on simulated and historical events and deployed online for rapid response. In addition to substantial runtime improvements, the proposed method enhances system resilience by enabling faster and more effective recovery and restoration. Case studies, particularly on the 2869-bus European gas and power network, demonstrate that the method substantially accelerates restoration while maintaining high-quality solutions, underscoring its potential for practical deployment in large-scale disaster response.</description>

      <title>Impact on transient stability of self-synchronisation control strategies in grid-forming VSC-based generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) are emerging as a solution for integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) into power systems. GFM-VSCs need a self-synchronisation strategy to ensure that all converters and generators in the power system are in synchronism and they reach the same frequency in steady state. The self-synchronisation strategy in GFM-VSCs that has received most attention in previous research is virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control. However, no systematic study of the effects on transient stability of different variants of this strategy has been carried out in previous work. This paper analyses and compares transient stability of four self-synchronisation strategies for GFM-VSCs: VSM without phase-locked loop (PLL), VSM with PLL, VSM without PLL using wash-out filter and integral-proportional (IP) controller. The paper also analyses two different methods that can \color{black} be applied to GFM-VSC self-synchronisation strategies to improve transient stability: the concept of virtual unsaturated active-power controller (VAPC), proposed in previous work, and an algorithm for frequency limitation in the GFM-VSC (FLC), which is proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Equivariances and Symmetries in the Control Barrier Function Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics, loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis. Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF synthesis.</description>

      <title>SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools.</description>

      <title>Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty -- A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Buoyancy Estimation for AUV Simulations Using Convex Hull-Based Submerged Volume Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater robotics research without precomputed hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>A Versatile and Programmable UAV Platform for Radio Access Network and End-to-End Cellular Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a measurement platform to capture mobile network performance metrics including coverage and quality of service in regions where conventional coverage testing approaches are frequently time-intensive, labor-demanding, and occasionally hazardous. Traditionally, crowd-sourcing methods are used to collect cellular network performance metrics. However, these approaches are inadequate in rural areas due to low-density population, and difficult terrain. The platform described here is a UAV-based and is designed to investigate the mobile network performance through aerial operations and gather Radio Access Network (RAN) signal alongside end-to-end network performance metrics. Our platform gathers metrics through the integration of an onboard computation unit and commercial off-the-shelf cellular modem. The gathered data are subsequently analyzed and displayed using geospatial mapping utilities and statistical techniques to deliver key observations on cellular network performance. Experimental results showed that the received signal power improves at higher altitudes due to enhanced line-of-sight (LoS) conditions as expected. However, the signal quality degrades as a result of increased interference from neighboring cells. The analysis reveals that for most of the geographic area covered in the initial experiments the system maintained acceptable signal quality, with adequate throughput performance for both uplink and downlink communications, while maintaining satisfactory round-trip time characteristics. Notably, the experiment showed that a strong radio signal metric for a given cell does not necessarily translate to consistent spatial coverage across the tested region.</description>

      <title>ShieldMMU: Detecting and Defending against Controlled-Channel Attacks in Shielding Memory System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intel SGX and hypervisors isolate non-privileged programs from other software, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. However, side-channel attacks continue to threaten Intel SGX's security, enabling malicious OS to manipulate PTE present bits, induce page faults, and steal memory access traces. Despite extensive research, existing defenses focus on detection or rely on impractical solutions. This paper presents ShieldMMU, a comprehensive solution for mitigating controlled channel attacks, balancing compatibility, performance, and usability. Leveraging a Merkle Tree-inspired Defense Tree (DD-Tree), ShieldMMU protects PTE integrity by detecting, locating, and restoring attacked PTEs. It identifies MMU page table lookup events and side-channel attacks, promptly restoring PTE parameters to prevent page fault traps and ensure secure non-privileged application operation within SGX. Our experiments confirm ShieldMMU's enhanced security and acceptable latency performance.</description>

      <title>Handling Infinite Domain Parameters in Planning Through Best-First Search with Delayed Partial Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters.</description>

      <title>Distance Between Stochastic Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript proposes a distance measure between stochastic linear dynamical systems. While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two linear time invariant stochastic dynamical systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. Distance measure for stochastic systems is proposed for the frequency domain setting as the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-$q$ Wasserstein distance between the push-forward measures under both systems' corresponding measurable maps from the parameter space to their respective space of system plants. It is proved and demonstrated using numerical simulation that the proposed frequency domain distance measure shall never exceed the proposed time domain distance measure counterpart. Lower and upper bounds are provided for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings. The proposed distance measures induce a topology in the corresponding (frequency/time) domain space of stochastic dynamical systems and will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Minimizing Inescapable Ellipsoids in Linear Periodically Time-Varying Systems Under Bounded Disturbances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter addresses optimal controller design for periodic linear time-varying systems under unknown-but-bounded disturbances. We introduce differential Lyapunov-type equations to describe time-varying inescapable ellipsoids and define an integral-based measure of their size. To minimize this measure, we develop a differential Riccati equation-based approach that provides exact solutions for state-feedback, observer synthesis, and output-feedback control. A key component is a systematic procedure for determining the optimal time-varying parameter, reducing an infinite-dimensional optimization to a simple iterative process. A numerical example validates the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Active Dual-Gated Graphene Transistors for Low-Noise, Drift-Stable, and Tunable Chemical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are among the most promising platforms for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing due to their high carrier mobility, large surface area, and low intrinsic noise. However, conventional single-gate GFET sensors in liquid environments suffer from severe limitations, including signal drift, charge trapping, and insufficient signal amplification. Here, we introduce a dual-gate GFET architecture that integrates a high-k hafnium dioxide local back gate with an electrolyte top gate, coupled with real-time feedback biasing. This design enables capacitive signal amplification while simultaneously suppressing gate leakage and low-frequency noise. By systematically evaluating seven distinct operational modes, we identify the Dual Mode Fixed configuration as optimal, achieving up to 20x signal gain, &gt; 15x lower drift compared with gate-swept methods, and up to 7x higher signal to noise ratio across a diverse range of analytes, including neurotransmitters, volatile organic compounds, environmental contaminants, and proteins. We further demonstrate robust, multiplexed detection using a PCB-integrated GFET sensor array, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the platform for portable, high-throughput sensing in complex environments. Together, these advances establish a versatile and stable sensing technology capable of real-time, label-free detection of molecular targets under ambient and physiological conditions, with broad applicability in health monitoring, food safety, agriculture, and environmental screening.</description>

      <title>Relative Localization of UAV Swarms in GNSS-Denied Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although encrypted control systems ensure confidentiality of private data, it is challenging to detect anomalies without the secret key as all signals remain encrypted. To address this issue, we propose a homomorphic encryption scheme for dynamic controllers that automatically discloses the residue signal for anomaly detection, while keeping all other signals private. To this end, we characterize the zero-dynamics of an encrypted dynamic system over a finite field of integers and incorporate it into a Learning With Errors (LWE) based scheme. We then present a method to further utilize the disclosed residue signal for implementing dynamic controllers over encrypted data, which does not involve re-encryption even when they have non-integer state matrices.</description>

      <title>Certified Learning of Incremental ISS Controllers for Unknown Nonlinear Polynomial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental input-to-state stability (delta-ISS) offers a robust framework to ensure that small input variations result in proportionally minor deviations in the state of a nonlinear system. This property is essential in practical applications where input precision cannot be guaranteed. However, analyzing delta-ISS demands precise knowledge of system dynamics to assess the state's incremental response to input changes, posing a challenge in real-world scenarios where mathematical models are unknown. In this work, we develop a data-driven approach to design delta-ISS Lyapunov functions together with their corresponding delta-ISS controllers for continuous-time input-affine nonlinear systems with polynomial dynamics, ensuring the delta-ISS property is achieved without requiring knowledge of the system dynamics. In our data-driven scheme, we collect only two sets of input-state trajectories from sufficiently excited dynamics. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, we design delta-ISS controllers using the collected samples through formulating a sum-of-squares optimization program.

      <title>On-the-fly Surrogation for Complex Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity models are essential for accurately capturing nonlinear system dynamics. However, simulation of these models is often computationally too expensive and, due to their complexity, they are not directly suitable for analysis, control design or real-time applications. Surrogate modelling techniques seek to construct simplified representations of these systems with minimal complexity, but adequate information on the dynamics given a simulation, analysis or synthesis objective at hand. Despite the widespread availability of system linearizations and the growing computational potential of autograd methods, there is no established approach that systematically exploits them to capture the underlying global nonlinear dynamics. This work proposes a novel surrogate modelling approach that can efficiently build a global representation of the dynamics on-the-fly from local system linearizations without ever explicitly computing a model. Using radial basis function interpolation and the second fundamental theorem of calculus, the surrogate model is only computed at its evaluation, enabling rapid computation for simulation and analysis and seamless incorporation of new linearization data. The efficiency and modelling capabilities of the method are demonstrated on simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional nonlinear systems pose considerable challenges for modeling and control across many domains, from fluid mechanics to advanced robotics. Such systems are typically approximated with reduced-order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Adaptive RIS Control for Mobile mmWave NLoS Communication Using Single-Bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as key enablers of reliable industrial automation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, particularly in environments with frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. While prior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation under user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate an adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS reconfiguration via a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user equipment (UE) to the RIS controller, operating without requiring UE position knowledge. The algorithm maintains the received signal power above a predefined threshold using only a single-bit comparison of received power levels. To analyze the algorithms performance, we establish a simulation-based Monte Carlo (MC) optimization benchmark that assumes full UE position knowledge, accounts for practical hardware constraints, and serves as an upper bound for performance evaluation. Using a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements and 1-bit phase quantization at 23.8 GHz, we validate the proposed approach in a semi-anechoic environment over a 60 cm by 92 cm area. The results demonstrate that the single-bit feedback-driven algorithm closes much of the performance gap to the MC upper bound while achieving up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to an inactive RIS baseline. These findings highlight the practical potential of feedback-based adaptive RIS control for robust mmWave non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication with mobile users.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control-Based Optimal Energy Management of Autonomous Electric Vehicles Under Cold Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.</description>

      <title>Robust Bandwidth Estimation for Real-Time Communication with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication (RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jiu2021/RBWE_offline.</description>

      <title>Co-Investment with Payoff-Sharing Mechanism for Cooperative Decision-Making in Network Design Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the overall system. This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can simultaneously benefit both operators and users. We address this challenge using a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network design game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design local infrastructures. In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing mechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case studies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transport networks in Zurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. Our evaluation considers impacts on environmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. The proposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked systems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Using O-RIS and Fiber Optic Backhaul (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents a novel hybrid underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system that integrates underwater optical access points (UOAPs) with a passive optical network (PON)-based fiber-optic backhaul to provide a resilient backbone. A hard switching mechanism is employed between direct and optical reconfigurable intelligent surface (O-RIS)-assisted links to ensure reliable connectivity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed system is evaluated under both active and multiple passive O-RIS configurations. To enhance reliability, the Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) schemes are applied. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that optimal O-RIS placement significantly enhances system performance. However, in the linear regime, placing it too close to the receiver causes degradation due to increased path loss and beam jitter in an identical water type. Moreover, increasing the number of O-RIS elements within practical limits further improves overall system performance and enhances adaptability to variations in the underwater channel.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Tap Changers and Nonlinear Loads on Voltage Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.</description>

      <title>ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks depends significantly on the quality of their instructions, which often require substantial human effort to craft. This underscores the need for automated instruction optimization. However, optimizing instructions is particularly challenging when working with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients are inaccessible. We introduce ACING, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that formulates instruction optimization as a stateless, continuous-action problem, enabling exploration of infinite instruction spaces using only black-box feedback. ACING automatically discovers prompts that outperform human-written prompts in 76% of instruction-induction tasks, with gains of up to 33 points and a 10-point median improvement over the best automatic baseline in 33 tasks spanning instruction-induction, summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Extensive ablations highlight its robustness and efficiency. An implementation of ACING is available at https://github.com/salmakh1/ACING.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06662v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>

      <title>System Identification from Partial Observations under Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the partially observed linear system identification, where the goal is to obtain reasonably accurate estimation of the balanced truncation of the true system up to order $k$ from output measurements. We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $\ell_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to a similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.</description>

      <title>SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards Innovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate ultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m. SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and relative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.</description>

Abstract: Obstacle crossing is an essential component of human locomotion, particularly for individuals with lower limb amputations who face elevated risks of imbalance and falls. While prior studies have explored this task, they often lack a comprehensive examination of kinematic and kinetic changes throughout the entire gait cycle across varying obstacle heights. This study creates a novel dataset collected from ten healthy adults performing obstacle crossing at four different heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm). Kinematic and kinetic data (angles and torques of hip, knee, and ankle) were recorded and analyzed. Results indicate that increased obstacle height leads to a longer swing phase and significant increases in both hip and knee joint angles (1.5* and 1.0*, respectively) and torques. In contrast, ankle joint angles and moments exhibited minimal variation across obstacle heights, indicating a relatively consistent movement strategy at the ankle. Furthermore, significant asymmetries were observed between the dominant and non-dominant foot: the dominant foot demonstrated larger hip and knee joint angles and more consistent ankle behavior, reflecting greater coordination. These findings offer valuable biomechanical insights for improving fall prevention strategies and informing the design of assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons.</description>
