      <title>Understanding Human Daily Experience Through Continuous Sensing: ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving human health and well-being requires an accurate and effective understanding of an individual's physical and mental state throughout daily life. To support this goal, we utilized smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep sensors to collect data passively and continuously for 24 hours a day, with minimal interference to participants' usual behavior, enabling us to gather quantitative data on daily behaviors and sleep activities across multiple days. Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue, stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality and stress.</description>

      <title>Detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury Using Multimodal Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance (BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and (ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum delay period.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interference Exploitation Waveform Design with Relaxed Block-Level Power Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates constructive interference (CI)-based waveform design for phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation symbols under relaxed block-level power constraints in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MIMO) communication systems. Existing linear CI-based precoding methods, including symbol-level precoding (SLP) and block-level precoding (BLP), suffer from performance limitations due to strict symbol-level power budgets or insufficient degrees of freedom over the block. To overcome these challenges, we propose a nonlinear waveform optimization framework that introduces additional optimization variables and maximizes the minimum CI metric across the transmission block. The optimal waveform is derived in closed form using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is explicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables. Moreover, the original problems are equivalently reformulated as tractable quadratic programming (QP) problems. To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a linear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms substantially outperform the conventional CI-SLP and CI-BLP approaches, particularly under high-order modulations and large block lengths.</description>

      <title>WiFo-CF: Wireless Foundation Model for CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04068v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user, multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset, whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization, validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.</description>

      <title>DFT-s-OFDM with Chirp Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new waveform called discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with chirp modulation (DFT-s-OFDM-CM) is proposed for the next generation of wireless communications. The information bits are conveyed by not only Q-ary constellation symbols but also the starting frequency of chirp signal. It could maintain the benefits provided by the chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), e.g., low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), full frequency diversity exploitation, etc. Simulation results confirm that the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM could achieve higher spectral efficiency while keeping the similar bit error rate (BER) to that of chirped DFT-s-OFDM. In addition, when maintaining the same spectral efficiency, the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM with the splitting of information bits into two streams enables the use of lower-order constellation modulation and offers greater resilience to noise, resulting in a lower BER than the chirped DFT-s-OFDM.</description>

      <title>Neuro-MoBRE: Exploring Multi-subject Multi-task Intracranial Decoding via Explicit Heterogeneity Resolving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurophysiological decoding, fundamental to advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies, has significantly benefited from recent advances in deep learning. However, existing decoding approaches largely remain constrained to single-task scenarios and individual subjects, limiting their broader applicability and generalizability. Efforts towards creating large-scale neurophysiological foundation models have shown promise, but continue to struggle with significant challenges due to pervasive data heterogeneity across subjects and decoding tasks. Simply increasing model parameters and dataset size without explicitly addressing this heterogeneity fails to replicate the scaling successes seen in natural language processing. Here, we introduce the Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE), a general-purpose decoding framework explicitly designed to manage the ubiquitous data heterogeneity in neurophysiological modeling. Neuro-MoBRE incorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a mixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain regions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus explicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity. Additionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further enhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a task-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle task-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial recordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex language decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE surpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding on unseen subjects.</description>

      <title>Dual-Function Radar-Communication Beamforming with Outage Probability Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated design of communication and sensing may offer a potential solution to address spectrum congestion. In this work, we develop a beamforming method for a dual-function radar-communication system, where the transmit signal is used for both radar surveillance and communication with multiple downlink users, despite imperfect channel state information (CSI). We focus on two scenarios of interest: radar-centric and communication-centric. In the radar-centric scenario, the primary goal is to optimize radar performance while attaining acceptable communication performance. To this end, we minimize a weighted sum of the mean-squared error in achieving a desired beampattern and a mean-squared cross correlation of the radar returns from directions of interest (DOI). We also seek to ensure that the probability of outage for the communication users remains below a desired threshold. In the communication-centric scenario, our main objective is to minimize the maximum probability of outage among the communication users while keeping the aforementioned radar metrics below a desired threshold. Both optimization problems are stochastic and untractable. We first take advantage of central limit theorem to obtain deterministic non-convex problems and then consider relaxations of these problems in the form of semidefinite programs with rank-1 constraints. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Subspace Fitting Approach for Wideband Near-Field Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two subspace fitting approaches are proposed for wideband near-field localization. Unlike in conventional far-field systems, where distance and angle can be estimated separately, spherical wave propagation in near-field systems couples these parameters. We therefore derive a frequency-domain near-field signal model for multi-target wideband systems and develop a subspace fitting-based MUSIC method that jointly estimates distance and angle. To reduce complexity, a Fresnel approximation MUSIC algorithm is further introduced to decouple the distance and angle parameters. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of both proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Information and Control Signalling Protocol for RIS-Empowered Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of RIS in radio access networks requires signaling between edge units and the RIS microcontroller (MC). Unfortunately, in several practical scenarios, the signaling latency is higher than the communication channel coherence time, which causes outdated signaling at the RIS. To counterbalance this, we introduce a simultaneous information and control signaling (SICS) protocol that enables operation adaptation through wireless control signal transmission. SICS assumes that the MC is equipped with a single antenna that operates at the same frequency as the RIS. RIS operates in simultaneous transmission and reflection (STAR) mode, and the source employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to superposition the information signal to the control signal. To maximize the achievable user data rate while ensuring the MC's ability to decode the control signal, we formulate and solve the corresponding optimization problem that returns RIS's reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the superposition coefficients of the NOMA scheme. Our results reveal the robustness of the SICS approach.</description>

      <title>Channel-Coherence-Adaptive Two-Stage Fully Digital Combining for mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment (UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\text{r}}$ received signals to $N_{\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this hardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital transceivers in future systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Spatial non-Stationary Channel Estimation: Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous OMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on channel estimation in extremely large aperture array (ELAA) systems, where near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity introduce complexities that hinder the effectiveness of traditional estimation techniques. A physics-based hybrid channel model is developed, incorporating non-binary visibility region (VR) masks to simulate diffraction-induced power variations across the antenna array. To address the estimation challenges posed by these channel conditions, a novel algorithm is proposed: Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (VR-HMM-P-SOMP). The method extends a greedy sparse recovery framework by integrating VR estimation through a hidden Markov model (HMM), using a novel emission formulation and Viterbi decoding. This allows the algorithm to adaptively mask steering vectors and account for spatial non-stationarity at the antenna level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances estimation accuracy compared to existing techniques, particularly in low-SNR and sparse scenarios, while maintaining a low computational complexity. The algorithm presents robustness across a range of design parameters and channel conditions, offering a practical solution for ELAA systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency-Aware Codebook Design for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead. Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.</description>

      <title>ChineseEEG-2: An EEG Dataset for Multimodal Semantic Alignment and Neural Decoding during Reading and Listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based neural decoding requires large-scale benchmark datasets. Paired brain-language data across speaking, listening, and reading modalities are essential for aligning neural activity with the semantic representation of large language models (LLMs). However, such datasets are rare, especially for non-English languages. Here, we present ChineseEEG-2, a high-density EEG dataset designed for benchmarking neural decoding models under real-world language tasks. Building on our previous ChineseEEG dataset, which focused on silent reading, ChineseEEG-2 adds two active modalities: Reading Aloud (RA) and Passive Listening (PL), using the same Chinese corpus. EEG and audio were simultaneously recorded from four participants during ~10.7 hours of reading aloud. These recordings were then played to eight other participants, collecting ~21.6 hours of EEG during listening. This setup enables speech temporal and semantic alignment across the RA and PL modalities.

      <title>Delay-Doppler Domain Signal Processing Aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility scenarios will be a critical part of 6G systems. Since the widely deployed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform suffers from subcarrier orthogonality loss under severe Doppler spread, delay-Doppler domain multi-carrier (DDMC) modulation systems, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), have been extensively studied. While OTFS can exploit time-frequency (TF) domain channel diversity, it faces challenges including high receiver complexity and inflexible TF resource allocation, making OFDM still the most promising waveform for 6G. In this article, we propose a DD domain signal processing-aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) scheme to enhance OFDM performance based on DDMC research insights. First, we design a DD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while incorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization. Second, we detail DD domain channel estimation using discrete TF pilots and prove that TF domain inter-carrier interference (ICI) could be transformed into DD domain Gaussian interference. Third, we derive closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DD domain channel estimation. Fourth, we develop maximum likelihood (ML) and peak detection-based channel estimators, along with a corresponding TF domain equalizer. Numerical results verify the proposed design, showing that DD-a-OFDM reduces the bit-error rate (BER) compared to classical OFDM and outperforms OTFS in channel estimation accuracy with lower pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Less Signals, More Understanding: Channel-Capacity Codebook Design for Digital Task-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction, restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks. Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic communication in future digital infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-Assisted Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy efficient wireless communication system based on fluid antenna relay (FAR) to solve the problem of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links caused by blockages with considering the physical properties. Driven by the demand for the sixth generation (6G) communication, fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a key technology due to their flexibility in dynamically adjusting antenna positions. Existing research on FAS primarily focuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the situations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS communication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy consumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the positions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve controllable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage which causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly considers the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale fading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position, FA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional schemes in terms of EE, achieving up to $23.39\%$ and $39.94\%$ higher EE than the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scheme and traditional AF relay scheme, respectively.</description>

      <title>Near-field Liquid Crystal RIS Phase-Shift Design for Secure Wideband Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology provides a low-power and scalable approach to implement a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). However, the LC-based RIS's phase-shift response is inherently frequency-dependent, which can lead to performance degradation if not properly addressed. This issue becomes especially critical in secure communication systems, where such variations may result in considerable information leakage. To avoid the need for full channel state information (CSI) acquisition and frequent RIS reconfiguration, we design RIS for a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to illuminate a desired area containing legitimate users while avoiding leakage to regions where potential eavesdroppers may be located. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the secrecy rate compared to methods that neglect frequency-dependent effects. In the considered setup, the proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of about 2 bits/symbol over an 8 GHz bandwidth when the center frequency is 60 GHz.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Indoor Positioning Based on Visible Light in the Presence of Dimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint communication and indoor positioning (JCP) system based on visible light communication (VLC) designed for high-precision indoor environments. The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received signal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis theorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is achieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active light-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while maintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is employed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust symbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight (LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician fading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet lighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below 10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across user locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve significantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks requiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel conditions.</description>

      <title>CASH: Context-Aware Smart Handover for Reliable UAV Connectivity on Aerial Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions aerial corridors for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to reduce ground traffic congestion by supporting 3D mobility, such as air taxis. A key challenge in these high-mobility aerial corridors is ensuring reliable connectivity, where frequent handovers can degrade network performance. To resolve this, we present a Context-Aware Smart Handover (CASH) protocol that uses a forward-looking scoring mechanism based on UAV trajectory to make proactive handover decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed CASH against existing handover protocols in a custom-built simulator. Results show that CASH reduces handover frequency by up to 78% while maintaining low outage probability. We then investigate the impact of base station density and safety margin on handover performance, where their optimal setups are empirically obtained to ensure reliable UAM communication.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectrum Demand Prediction: A Spatio-Temporal Framework with Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.</description>

      <title>Enabling Site-Specific Cellular Network Simulation Through Ray-Tracing-Driven ns-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating cellular systems, from 5G New Radio (NR) and 5G-Advanced to 6G, is challenging because the performance emerges from the tight coupling of propagation, beam management, scheduling, and higher-layer interactions. System-level simulation is therefore indispensable, yet the vast majority of studies rely on the statistical 3GPP channel models. These are well suited to capture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot reproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon blockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and angle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This paper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath Components (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer (RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel matrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control (MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based channel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP implementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity. This new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT) capabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking studies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage mitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for precise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis. In both cases, the trace-driven engine exposes performance inflections that the statistical model does not exhibit, confirming its value for high-fidelity system-level cellular networks research and as a step toward DT applications.</description>

      <title>Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety, particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

      <title>A Foundation Model for DAS Signal Recognition and Visual Prompt Tuning of the Pre-trained Model for Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.</description>

      <title>Tradeoff Between the Number of Transmitted Molecules and the BER Performance in Molecular Communication between Bionanosensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate (BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules' respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamfocusing for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal component of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging high-frequency bands and massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) to deliver both high-capacity communication and high-precision sensing. However, these technological advancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation of M-MIMO \mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated power consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both hardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these considerations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid beamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a point target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation for the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix for the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the CRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy efficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users. To address the resulting \mbox{nonconvex problems}, we first utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a fully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an efficient alternating \mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the analog-and-digital beamformer. \mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint distance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However, the adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance estimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore, enhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation, unveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Phase-Pole-Free Images and Smooth Coil Sensitivity Maps by Regularized Nonlinear Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV) reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps. Methods: Phase poles are detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart. Results: Phase poles are reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$) auto-calibration (AC) regions. Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in challenging MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Coded Federated Learning: Privacy Preservation and Straggler Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of federated learning in the presence of stragglers. For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a contactless and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring human behavior in applications such as astronaut extravehicular activity monitoring, human-autonomy collaborative cockpit, and unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance. However, real-world deployments usually face the challenge of domain knowledge shifts arising from inter-subject variability, heterogeneous physical environments, and unseen activity patterns, resulting in significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns transferable representations without collecting data from the target domain. DGAR integrates instance-adaptive feature modulation with cross-domain distribution alignment to enhance both personalization and generalization. Specifically, it incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to extract salient spatiotemporal features and employs correlation alignment to mitigate inter-domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments on public RF-based datasets -- HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM -- demonstrate that DGAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 5.81% improvement in weighted F1-score. The empirical results substantiate the generalization capability of DGAR in real-time RF sensing across dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) into cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users-energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs)-without sacrificing time-frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BD-RIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero-forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non-coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy (HE) at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BD-RIS, all based on long-term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub-problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BD-RIS with a group-or fully-connected architecture achieves significant EH gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a 7-fold increase in the average sum of HE when a heuristic-based scattering matrix design is employed.

      <title>Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts.

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>

      <title>UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods.
