      <title>Walk Before You Dance: High-fidelity and Editable Dance Synthesis via Generative Masked Motion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled the automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving high realism, precise dance-music synchronization, diverse motion expression, and physical plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a generative masked text-to-motion model as a distribution prior to learn a probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals, including music, genre, and pose, into high-quality dance motion sequences. Our framework also supports semantic motion editing, such as motion inpainting and body part modification. Specifically, we introduce a multi-tower masked motion model that integrates a text-conditioned masked motion backbone with two parallel, modality-specific branches: a music-guidance tower and a pose-guidance tower. The model is trained using synchronized and progressive masked training, which allows effective infusion of the pretrained text-to-motion prior into the dance synthesis process while enabling each guidance branch to optimize independently through its own loss function, mitigating gradient interference. During inference, we introduce classifier-free logits guidance and pose-guided token optimization to strengthen the influence of music, genre, and pose signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art in dance generation, significantly advancing both the quality and editability over existing approaches.

      <title>MeshMosaic: Scaling Artist Mesh Generation via Local-to-Global Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers remains challenging for autoregressive generative models. Existing transformer-based methods suffer from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions. This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.</description>
