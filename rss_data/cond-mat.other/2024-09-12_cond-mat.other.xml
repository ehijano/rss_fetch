      <title>Disorder enhanced exciton transport and quantum information spreading with the assistance of cavity QED</title>

Abstract: Molecular materials have been studied as a potential platform for highly efficient transport such as exciton transport and quantum information spreading. However, one detrimental factor to transport efficiency is the inherent disorder of the molecular system, where site-to-site hopping is suppressed by Anderson localization. Here we theoretically report a novel approach to eliminate the negative impact of disorder by strongly coupling the system to a cavity, where the cavity photon bridges spatially separated sites and builds an additional transport channel, cavity-mediated jumping. Our analysis of the open quantum system dynamics shows in terms of long-range transport, the two channels hold a competitive relation. When disorder suppresses site-to-site hopping, transport occurs mainly through cavity-mediated jumping in disguise. Therefore, with the assistance of the cavity, disorder in certain ranges can enhance transport and certain disordered systems can even be more efficient for transport than the homogeneous system. These results provide insight into the design of next-generation materials for exciton transport and quantum information spreading by leveraging hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Switchable Crystalline Islands in Super Lubricant Arrays</title>

Abstract: Expanding the performance of field effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies. A highly desired nonvolatile response in tiny multiferroic transistors is expected by electric field control of atomic movements rather than the typical electronic redistribution. Recently, such field effect control of structural transitions was established in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding narrow boundary dislocations between oppositely polarized domains. The interfacial ferroelectric response, however, relied on preexisting boundary strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations. Here, we report the robust switching of single-domain polytypes in nm-scale islands embedded in super lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with parallel functional flakes. The incommensurate flakes above and under the spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form uniform crystalline islands free from interlayer deformations. By imaging the polytypes' ferroelectric response, we observe reversible nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we accurately position the boundary strip, modify the interlayer twist angle, and nucleate intermediate polar domain patterns. By precisely designing the size, shape, symmetry, and distribution of the islands in these Super Lubricant Arrays of Polytype (SLAP), we envision numerous device functionalities and SlideTronics applications. These range from ultra-sensitive detectors of atomic-scale shifts to nonvolatile multi-ferroic tunneling transistors with tunable coercive switching fields, and even elastically-coupled memory cells for neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Edge modes, extended TQFT, and measurement based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>
