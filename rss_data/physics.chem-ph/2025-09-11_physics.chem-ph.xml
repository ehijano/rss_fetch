      <title>Electronic Fluctuations and Ionic Dynamics in Molten Silver Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.</description>

      <title>Configuration-interaction calculations with density-functional theory molecular orbitals for modeling valence- and core-excited states in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate configuration-interaction (CI) calculations on a basis of molecular orbitals generated by preliminary density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. We use this CI/DFT framework to improve the modeling of core-excited states by exploiting the flexibility and account for electron correlation of DFT orbitals compared to the canonical Hartree-Fock analogs. We assess the performance of our approach on the valence- and core-excited electronic states of three molecules with increasing levels of electron-correlation complexity: the singly bonded CH4, doubly bonded CO2, and triply bonded N2. For molecules with strong electron correlation effects, such as CO2 and N2, the inclusion of double excitations is important to model the core-hole excited states with reasonable accuracy. CI/DFT outperforms standard single-reference CI on Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals and competes with multi-reference CI calculations with multi-configuration self-consistent field orbitals in the modeling of molecules with strong electron-correlation effects, but weak multi-reference nature of their wave function such as CO2. In contrast, the choice of the molecular-orbital basis is irrelevant when modeling systems with negligible electron-correlation effects like CH4 or important multi-reference nature of their wave function like N2.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dissociation hierarchy of aniline under UV-induced multiphoton ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiphoton ionization of the simplest aromatic amine, aniline, was examined utilizing a kinetic energy-correlated time-of-flight mass spectrometer at a wavelength of 266 nm. The primary and secondary fragment channels have been identified, and their plausible internal energy dependence has been discussed. Furthermore, the sequential loss fragment channel has been analyzed using the energy-correlated mass spectrum, revealing the fragment channels along with their respective parent mass exclusively. The computed energetics are corroborated with the experimental findings to further support the dissociation hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Isomer- and state-dependent ion-molecule reactions between Coulomb-crystallised Ca$^+$ ions and 1,2-dichloroethene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of isomer- and state-dependent reactions between Coulomb-crystallised laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions and \emph{cis/trans}-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) isomers. By manipulating the electronic state populations of Ca$^+$ through tuning of laser cooling parameters, we observed distinct reactivities in its ground and excited states, as well as with the geometric isomers of DCE. Our experiments revealed two primary reaction channels, formation of CaCl$^+$ and C$_2$HCaCl$^+$, followed by secondary reaction pathways. While excited-state reactions proceed at rate coefficients consistent with capture theory predictions, ground-state reactions show a systematically lower reactivity. \emph{Ab initio} calculations of reaction pathways suggest that this suppression stems from the formation of long-lived reaction complexes. The \textit{cis} isomer was found to exhibit a higher reactivity with all electronic states of Ca$^+$ than its \textit{trans} counterpart. The present study provides insights into the combined effects of molecular structure and quantum states influencing ion-molecule reaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Clean Combustion: A Pathway to Sustainable Aerospace Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving clean combustion systems is crucial in terms of solving environmental impacts, decarbonization needs and sustainability matters. Traditional combustion modeling techniques via computational fluid dynamics with accurate chemical kinetics face obstacles in computational cost and accurate representation of turbulence-chemistry interactions. Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a new framework, merges physical laws with data-driven learning and shows great potential as an alternative methodology. By directly integrating conservation equations into their training process, PINNs achieve accurate mesh-free modeling of complex combustion phenomena despite having limited data sets. This review examines how this approach applies to clean combustion systems while focusing on their impact in aerospace applications including flame dynamics, turbulent combustion, emission prediction, and instability management in propulsion systems. Next-generation aerospace engines rely on PINNs to reduce computational costs while increasing predictive performance and enabling real-time control methods. This analysis concludes by exploring current barriers and future paths, while demonstrating how PINNs can revolutionize sustainable and efficient combustion technologies in aerospace propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Poly-liquid behaviors of self-associating fluids and mesoscopic aggregation in liquid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conflict with standard notions of thermodynamics, mesoscopically-sized inclusions (``clusters'') of a solute-rich liquid have been observed in equilibrated solutions of proteins and other molecules. According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer's binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid-liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction. The present findings provide further evidence for the complexation scenario and suggest new experimental ways to test it.</description>

      <title>Insertion space in repulsive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>

      <title>Intensity-dependent precision two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy of Xe using narrow-bandwidth long-pulse deep-UV laser radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a precision measurement of the $(5\mathrm{p})^{5}6\mathrm{p} \, [1/2]_{0}\leftarrow (5\mathrm{p})^{6} \, ^{1}\mathrm{S}_{0}$ transition wavenumber of Xe by Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy using near-Fourier-transform-limited long pulses of UV-laser radiation. The measurements led to absolute uncertainties of 750~kHz in the two-photon transition wavenumbers for the five dominant isotopes of Xe, e.g., 80118.982918(27)~cm$^{-1}$ for $^{136}$Xe. These values were combined with other precision measurements in Xe to resolve an $\sim1~\mathrm{GHz}$ discrepancy between the ionization energy of Xe obtained in recent measurements from the $(6{\rm s})[3/2]_2$ metastable state [Herburger {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. A {\bf 109}, 032816 (2024)] and the ionization energy listed in the NIST atomic database. The analysis indicates that the natural-abundance-weighted ionization energy of Xe should be revised by $-0.023$~cm$^{-1}$ to 97833.7641(20)~cm$^{-1}$. Large fluctuations in the UV-laser pulse intensities were exploited to characterize intensity-dependent shifts of the observed two-photon transition frequencies. Shifts of up to $- 20~\mathrm{MHz}$ were observed and attributed to frequency shifts arising from chirps in the amplification and upconversion of the laser radiation rather than to the ac-Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium lifetimes of DNA under electronic current in a molecular junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the liquid-liquid transition in cold water/glycerol mixtures by ih-RIDME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water/glycerol mixtures are common for experiments with biomacromolecules at cryogenic temperatures due to their vitrification properties. Above the glass transition temperature, they undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Using the novel EPR technique called intermolecular hyperfine Relaxation-Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (ih-RIDME), we quantified the molar composition in frozen water/glycerol mixtures with one or the other component deuterated after the phase transition. Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition regardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance. With the new ih-RIDME data, we can also revisit the already reported body of glass transition data for such mixtures and build a consistent picture for water/glycerol freezing and phase transitions. Our results also indicate that ih-RIDME has the potential for investigating the solvation shells of spin-labelled macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Exact static linear response of excited states from ensemble density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a recent work [E. Fromager, J. Phys. Chem. A 2025, 129, 4, 1143-1155] on the ensemble density functional theory (DFT) of excited electronic energy levels, we derive in this paper the ensuing static linear response theory, thus allowing for an in-principle exact evaluation of excited-state density-density linear response functions in a completely frequency-independent setting. Once individual-state components of the inverse ensemble linear response function have been introduced, a working Dyson-type equation naturally emerges for each state, individually. By considering the zero-weight limit of the theory, which infinitesimally deviates from standard Kohn--Sham DFT, exact excited-state corrections to ground-state linear response DFT can be identified. They involve the first-order weight derivatives of the ensemble Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential and kernel, thus confirming the importance in ensemble DFT of both weight and density-functional derivatives of the ensemble Hxc energy functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a new approach to designing both algorithms and error detection codes for preparing approximate ground states of molecules. We propose a classical algorithm to find the optimal stabilizer state by using excitations of the Hartree-Fock state, followed by constructing quantum error-detection codes based on this stabilizer state using codeword-stabilized codes. Through various numerical experiments, we confirm that our method finds the best stabilizer approximations to the true ground states of molecules up to 36 qubits in size. Additionally, we construct generalized stabilizer states that offer a better approximation to the true ground states. Furthermore, for a simple noise model, we demonstrate that both the stabilizer and (some) generalized stabilizer states can be prepared with higher fidelity using the error-detection codes we construct. Our work represents a promising step toward designing algorithms for early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: An efficient mixed deterministic/sparse-stochastic plane-wave approach is developed for bandstructure calculations of large supercell periodic generalized-Kohn-Sham density functional theory, for any hybrid-exchange density functional. The method works for very large elementary cells and supercells, and we benchmark it on covalently bonded solids and molecular crystals with nonbonded interactions, for supercells of up to 33,000 atoms. Memory and CPU requirements scale with supercell size quasi-linearly.</description>

      <title>RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</description>
