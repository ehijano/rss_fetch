      <title>A mathematical model of vaccine hesitancy: Analysing the impact of political trends and the interaction across age and education groups in the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 disease has significantly reduced its mortality rate and spread. However, despite its availability, a considerable proportion of the public has either refused or delayed getting vaccinated. This reluctance is known as vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical model to investigate how social interaction can impact vaccine hesitancy. The model describes the temporal transitions between different vaccination classes of the population (those vaccinated, those who are not yet vaccinated but agree to be vaccinated, and those who refuse). We apply the model to state and national survey data from the USA to estimate model parameters that quantify the rates at which public opinion on vaccination changes. Moreover, we investigate how political trends and demographic factors, such as age and education, impact these parameters. Our results show that state-level political affiliation, age, and educational level shape opinions on vaccination and have a strong influence on the temporal dynamics of attitude changes.</description>

      <title>Machine Generalize Learning in Agent-Based Models: Going Beyond Surrogate Models for Calibration in ABMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability \* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.</description>

      <title>Defining and Estimating Outcomes Directly Averted by a Vaccination Program when Rollout Occurs Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating the total deaths averted by vaccination has been of great public health interest. Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only "directly averted" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes "directly averted" by vaccination$\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an unbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular "hazard difference" estimator frequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard difference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it fails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the unvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for averted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important pathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections given a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare estimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have been averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate). Future studies can explore the identifiability of the causal estimand in observational settings.</description>

      <title>Route to Chaos in Multi-Species Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate species-rich mathematical models of ecosystems. While much of the existing literature focuses on the properties of equilibrium fixed points, persistent dynamics (e.g., limit cycles or chaos) have also been observed, both in natural or lab-controlled ecosystems and in mathematical models. Here we emphasize the emergence of limit cycles following Hopf bifurcations tuned by the variability of interspecies interaction. As this variability increases, and owing to the large dimensionality of the system, limit cycles typically acquire a growing spectrum of frequencies. This often leads to the appearance of strange attractors, with a chaotic dynamics of species abundances characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent. We observe that limit cycles and strange attractors preserve biodiversity to some extent, as they maintain dynamical stability without species extinction. We give numerical evidences that this route to chaos dominates in ecosystems with strong enough interactions and where predator-prey behavior dominates over competition and mutualism. Based on arguments from random matrix theory, we further conjecture that this scenario is generic in ecosystems with large number of species, and identify the key parameters driving it. Overall, we show that the model we consider provides a unifying framework, where a wide range of population dynamics emerge from a simple few-parameter model.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Imputing Genetic Distances in Spatiotemporal Pathogen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal modeling workflows.</description>
