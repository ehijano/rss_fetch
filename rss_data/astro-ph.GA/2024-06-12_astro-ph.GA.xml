      <title>The Manhattan Suite: Accelerated galaxy evolution in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational advances have allowed the detection of galaxies, protoclusters, and galaxy clusters at higher and higher redshifts, opening a new view into extreme galaxy evolution. I present an argument that the high redshift, massive galaxies discovered over the last decade are really the most massive galaxies within protocluster-cores of galaxy clusters at $z\sim2$, and that they are the partial descendants of same galaxies discovered by JWST at $z\sim9$. To that end, I present $\textit{The Manhattan Suite}$, a set of $100$ high resolution zoom-in simulations of the most massive galaxy clusters, out to $9\,R_\mathrm{vir}$, selected at $z = 2$ from a ($1.5\,\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ parent volume, and simulated using the $\textit{Simba}$ model. Unlike other cluster suites, my selection at $z = 2$ ensures that these systems are biased in a similar fashion to observations, in that they should be the brightest and the most massive by construction at $z \gtrsim 2$. I show that my sample is able to reproduce extremely star-bursting protoclusters such as SPT2349-56, high redshift galaxy clusters XLSSC122 and JKCS0249, and the wealth of massive (sometimes quenched) galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ and up to $z \sim 9$. I argue that these systems are intimately linked, and represent the same evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>A Breakdown of the Black Hole - Bulge Mass Relation in Local Active Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between black hole (BH) mass and bulge stellar mass for a sample of 117 local ($z \sim 0$) galaxies hosting low-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our sample comes from Reines &amp; Volonteri (2015), who found that, for a given $total$ stellar mass, these AGNs have BH masses more than an order of magnitude smaller than those in early-type galaxies with quiescent BHs. Here we aim to determine whether or not this AGN sample falls on the canonical BH-to-$bulge$ mass relation by utilizing bulge-disk decompositions and determining bulge stellar masses using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find that our AGN sample remains offset by more than an order of magnitude from the $M_\mathrm{BH}-M_\mathrm{bulge}$ relation defined by early-type galaxies with dynamically detected BHs. We caution that using canonical BH-to-bulge mass relations for galaxies other than ellipticals and bulge-dominated systems may lead to highly biased interpretations. This work bears directly to predictions for gravitational wave detections and cosmological simulations that are tied to the local BH-to-bulge mass relations.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and Dynamics of the Galactic Bar revealed by Gaia Long Period Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take low-amplitude, long period variable (LA-LPV) candidates in Gaia DR3 as tracers of the kinematics and dynamics of the Milky Way bar. LA-LPVs, like other LPVs, have high luminosities and follow a tight period-luminosity relation, but unlike e.g. Mira variables, their radial velocity measurements are reliable due to their smaller pulsation amplitudes. We supplement the Gaia astrometric and radial velocity measurements with distance moduli assigned using a period-luminosity relation to acquire full 6D phase space information. The assigned distances are validated by comparing to geometric distances and StarHorse distances, which shows biases less than $\sim5\%$. Our sample provides an unprecedented panoramic picture of the inner Galaxy with minimal selection function effects. We map the kinematics of the inner Milky Way and find a significant kinematic signature corresponding to the Galactic bar. We measure the pattern speed of the Galactic bar using the continuity equation and find $\Omega_{\rm b}=34.1\pm2.4$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We develop a simple, robust and model-independent method to measure the dynamical length of the bar using only kinematics and find $R_{\rm b}\sim4.0$ kpc. We validate both measurements using N-body simulations. Assuming knowledge of the gravitational potential of the inner Milky Way, we analyse the orbital structure of the Galactic bar using orbital frequency ratios. The $x_1$ orbits are the dominant bar-supporting orbital family in our sample. Amongst the selected bar stars, the $x_1 v_1$ or "banana" orbits constitute a larger fraction ($\sim 15\%$) than other orbital families in the bar, implying that they are the dominant family contributing to the Galactic X-shape, although contributions from other orbital families are present.</description>

      <title>A spatially resolved radio spectral study of the galaxy M 51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio continuum emission from galaxies at gigahertz frequencies can be used as an extinction-free tracer of star formation. However, at frequencies of a few hundred megahertz, there is evidence for low-frequency spectral flattening. We wish to better understand the origin of this low-frequency flattening and, to this end, perform a spatially resolved study of the nearby spiral galaxy M 51. We explore the different effects that can cause flattening of the spectrum towards lower frequencies, such as free-free absorption and cosmic-ray ionisation losses. We used radio continuum intensity maps between 54 and 8350 MHz at eight different frequencies, with observations at 240 MHz from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope presented for the first time. We corrected for contribution from thermal free-free emission using an H$\alpha$ map that has been extinction-corrected with 24 $\mu$m data. We fitted free-free absorption models to the radio spectra to determine the emission measure (EM) as well as polynomial functions to measure the non-thermal spectral curvature. The non-thermal low-frequency radio continuum spectrum between 54 and 144 MHz is very flat and even partially inverted, particularly in the spiral arms; contrary, the spectrum at higher frequencies shows the typical non-thermal radio continuum spectrum. However, we do not find any correlation between the EMs calculated from radio and from H$\alpha$ observations; instead, the non-thermal spectral curvature weakly correlates with the HI gas mass surface density. This suggests that cosmic-ray ionisation losses play an important role in the low-frequency spectral flattening. The observed spectral flattening towards low frequencies in M 51 is caused by a combination of ionisation losses and free-free absorption. The reasons for this flattening need to be understood in order to use sub-GHz frequencies as a star-formation tracer.</description>

      <title>An empirical isochrone archive for nearby open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ages of star clusters and co-moving stellar groups contain essential information about the Milky Way. Their special properties make them excellent tracers of galactic structure and key components to unlocking its star formation history. Yet, even though the importance of stellar population ages has been widely recognized, their determination remains a challenging task often associated with highly model-dependent and uncertain results. We propose a new approach to this problem, which relies on empirical isochrones of known clusters extracted from high-quality observational data. These purely observation-based data products open up the possibility of relative age determination, free of stellar evolution model assumptions. For the derivation of the empirical isochrones, we used a combination of the statistical analysis tool principal component analysis for preprocessing and the supervised machine learning method support vector regression for curve extraction. To improve the statistical reliability of our result, we defined the empirical isochrone of a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a cluster as the median calculated from a set of bootstrapped curves. We provide empirical isochrones in all Gaia DR2 and DR3 color combinations for 83 nearby clusters, paving the way for a relative comparison between individual stellar populations based on an age-scaling ladder of empirical isochrones of known clusters. Due to the precision of the available observational data, we report accurate lower main sequence empirical isochrones for many clusters in our sample, which are of special interest as this region is known to be especially complex to model. We validate our results by comparing the extracted empirical isochrones to cluster ages in the literature. We also investigate the added information that empirical isochrones covering the lower main sequence can provide on two case studies.</description>

      <title>A quasar-galaxy merger at $z\sim 6.2$: rapid host growth via accretion of two massive satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy in the rest-frame optical bands of the system PJ308-21, a quasar at $z=6.2342$ caught as its host galaxy interacts with companion galaxies. We detect spatially extended emission of several emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII], [NII], [SII], HeII), which we use to study the properties of the ionized phase of the interstellar medium: the source and hardness of the photoionizing radiation field, metallicity, dust reddening, electron density and temperature, and star formation. We also marginally detect continuum starlight emission associated with the companion sources. We find that at least two independent satellite galaxies are part of the system. While the quasar host appears highly enriched and obscured, with AGN-like photoionization conditions, the western companion shows minimal dust extinction, low metallicity ($Z\sim0.4$ Z$_\odot$), and star-formation driven photoionization. The eastern companion shows higher extinction and metallicity ($Z\sim0.8$ Z$_\odot$) compared to the western companion, and it is at least partially photoionized by the nearby quasar. We do not find any indication of AGN in the companion sources. Our study shows that while the quasar host galaxy is already very massive ($M_{\rm dyn}&gt;10^{11}$ M$_\odot$), it is still rapidly building up by accreting two relatively massive ($M_{\rm star}\sim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) companion sources. This dataset showcases the power of JWST in exposing the build-up of massive galaxies in the first Gyr of the Universe.</description>

      <title>NEATH III: a molecular line survey of a simulated star-forming cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present synthetic line observations of a simulated molecular cloud, utilising a self-consistent treatment of the dynamics and time-dependent chemical evolution. We investigate line emission from the three most common CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) and six supposed tracers of dense gas (NH$_3$, HCN, N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, CS, HNC). Our simulation produces a range of line intensities consistent with that observed in real molecular clouds. The HCN-to-CO intensity ratio is relatively invariant with column density, making HCN (and chemically-similar species such as CS) a poor tracer of high-density material in the cloud. The ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ to HCN or CO, on the other hand, is highly selective of regions with densities above $10^{22} \, {\rm cm^{-2}}$, and the N$_2$H$^+$ line is a very good tracer of the dynamics of high volume density ($&gt;10^4 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) material. Focusing on cores formed within the simulated cloud, we find good agreement with the line intensities of an observational sample of prestellar cores, including reproducing observed CS line intensities with an undepleted elemental abundance of sulphur. However, agreement between cores formed in the simulation, and models of isolated cores which have otherwise-comparable properties, is poor. The formation from and interaction with the large-scale environment has a significant impact on the line emission properties of the cores, making isolated models unsuitable for interpreting observational data.</description>

      <title>Metal-Poor Stars in the MW Disk: Resonant Cooling of Vertical Oscillations of Halo Stars in Barred Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical simulations of a barred disk galaxy embedded in nonspinning and spinning dark matter (DM) halos, we present a novel mechanism of `cooling' the vertical oscillations of halo DM particles, which acquire the disk kinematics. The underlying mechanism consists of resonant interactions between halo particles and the stellar bar. The cooling mechanism acts both on dynamical and secular timescales, i.e., from ~ 0.5 Gyr to few Gyr, and the stellar bar acts to absorb the kinetic energy of the vertical motions. Using a Milky Way-type stellar halo, we estimate the population of metal-poor disk stars which have been trapped by the MW disk and analyze its kinematics. We find that the population of metal-poor MW disk stars with $|z|\ltorder 3$\,kpc detected by the Gaia DR3 and other surveys can have their origin in the stellar halo. The cooled population also migrates radially outwards compared by acquiring energy from the spinning bar, and prograde-moving stars have a different distribution from the retrograde ones. Next, we have calculated the ratio of the prograde-to-retrograde orbits of the cooled population and found that this ratio varies radially, with the fast-spinning stellar halo resulting in the shallower radial increase of this ratio outside of the corotation. The nonspinning stellar halo shows a monotonic increase of this ratio with radius outside the corotation. Together with analyzed radial migration of these halo stars, the cooling phenomenon of halo metal-poor stars can explain their current disk population, and has corollaries for the chemical evolution of disk galaxies in general.</description>

      <title>All-sky three-dimensional dust density and extinction Maps of the Milky Way out to 2.8 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional dust density maps are crucial for understanding the structure of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way and the processes that shape it. However, constructing these maps requires large datasets and the methods used to analyse them are computationally expensive and difficult to scale up. As a result it is has only recently become possible to map kiloparsec-scale regions of our Galaxy at parsec-scale grid sampling. We present all-sky three-dimensional dust density and extinction maps of the Milky Way out to 2.8~kpc in distance from the Sun using the fast and scalable Gaussian Process algorithm \DustT. The sampling of the three-dimensional map is $l,b,d = 1^{\circ} \times1^{\circ} \times 1.7$~pc. The input extinction and distance catalogue contains 120 million stars with photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR2, 2MASS and AllWISE. This combines the strengths of optical and infrared data to probe deeper into the dusty regions of the Milky Way. We compare our maps with other published 3D dust maps. All maps quantitatively agree at the $0.001$~mag~pc$^{-1}$ scale with many qualitatively similar features, although each map also has its own features. We recover Galactic features previously identified in the literature. Moreover, we also see a large under-density that may correspond to an inter-arm or -spur gap towards the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>Simulations predict intermediate-mass black hole formation in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are those between 100 and 10$^5$ solar masses ($M_{\odot}$); their formation process is debated. One possible origin is the growth of less massive black holes (BHs) via mergers with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs $&lt;500 M_{\odot}$ because the gravitational wave recoil ejects them when they merge with other BHs. We perform star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC's parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs $\gtrsim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second data release for the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey. This data release is an area of 12,892-deg^2 around the South Galactic Pole region covering 20h 40m &lt;= RA &lt;= 6h 40m, -90deg &lt;= Dec &lt;= +30deg. Observations were taken in 2020 using the Phase-II configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and covering a frequency range of 72-231MHz with twenty frequency bands. We produce a wideband source-finding mosaic over 170-231MHz with a median root mean squared noise of 1.5 (+1.5/-0.5) mJy beam^(-1). We present a catalogue of 624,866 components, including 562,302 components which are spectrally fit. This catalogue is 98% complete at 50mJy, and a reliability of 98.7% at a 5sigma level, consistent with expectations for this survey. The catalogue is made available via Vizier and the PASA datastore and accompanying mosaics for this data release are made available via AAO Data Central and SkyView.</description>

      <title>Detailed chemical abundances of the globular cluster Terzan 6 in the inner bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used near-infrared spectroscopy at medium-high resolution (R=8,000$-$25,000) to perform the first comprehensive chemical study of the intermediate luminosity bulge globular cluster Terzan~6. We derived detailed abundances and abundance patterns of 27 giant stars, likely members of Terzan~6, based on their accurate Hubble Space Telescope proper motions and line-of-sight radial velocities. From the spectral analysis of these stars, we determined an average heliocentric radial velocity of 143.3$\pm$1.0 km s$^{-1}$ with a velocity dispersion of 5.1$\pm$0.7 km s$^{-1}$ and an average [Fe/H]=$-0.65\pm0.01$ and a low 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.03 dex. We also measured some depletion of [Mn/Fe] with respect to the solar-scaled values and enhancement of for [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [O/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Na/Fe], and, to a lower extent, for [K/Fe], consistent with previous measurements of other bulge globular clusters and favoring the scenario of a rapid bulge formation and chemical enrichment. Some spread in the light element abundances suggest the presence of first- and second-generation stars, typical of genuine globulars. Finally, we measured some depletion of carbon and low $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ isotopic ratios, as in previous studies of field and cluster bulge giants, indicating that extra-mixing mechanisms should be at work during the post main sequence evolution in the high metallicity regime as well.</description>

      <title>Systematic Collapse of the Accretion Disc Across the Supermassive Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes (SMBH) is not well understood. Standard disc models match to zeroth order in predicting substantial energy dissipation within optically-thick material producing a characteristic strong blue/UV continuum. However they fail at reproducing more detailed comparisons to the observed spectral shapes along with their observed variability. Based on stellar mass black holes within our galaxy, accretion discs should undergo a transition into an X-ray hot, radiatively inefficient flow, below a (mass scaled) luminosity of $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$. While this has been seen in limited samples of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a few rare changing-look AGN, it is not at all clear whether this transition is present in the wider AGN population across cosmic time. A key issue is the difficulty in disentangling a change in spectral state from increased dust obscuration and/or host galaxy contamination, effectively drowning out the AGN emission. Here we use the new eROSITA eFEDS Survey to identify unobscured AGN from their X-ray emission, matched to excellent optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam; allowing the subtraction of the host galaxy contamination. The resulting, uncontaminated, AGN spectra reveal a smooth transition from a strongly disc dominated state in bright AGN, to the collapse of the disc into an inefficient X-ray plasma in the low luminosity AGN, with the transition occurring at $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$; revealing fundamental aspects of accretion physics in AGN.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies between spectroscopy and HST photometry in tagging multiple stellar populations in 22 globular clusters</title>

Abstract: Multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are stars distinct by their abundances of light elements. The MPs can be directly separated by measuring abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg with spectroscopy or indirectly from photometric sequences created by the impact of different chemistry on band passes of particular filters, such as the HST pseudo-colours in the ultraviolet. An attempt to link HST pseudo-colours maps (PCMs) and spectroscopy was done by Marino et al. (2019), using abundances mostly from our FLAMES survey. However, we uncovered that an incomplete census of stars in common was used in their population tagging. We correct the situation by building our own PCMs and matching them with our abundances in 20 GCs, plus two GCs from other sources, doubling the sample with spectroscopic abundances available. We found that the pseudo-colour (magF275W-2*magF336W+magF438W) does not have a monotonic trend with Na abundances, enhanced by proton-capture reactions in MPs. Moreover, on average about 16% of stars with spectroscopic Na abundances show a discrepant tagging of MPs with respect to the HST photometry. Stars with chemistry of second generation (SG) are mistaken for first generation (FG) objects according to HST photometry and vice versa. In general, photometric indices tend to overestimate the fraction of FG stars, in particular in low mass GCs. We offer a simple explanation for these findings. Finally, we publish all our PCMs, with more than 31,800 stars in 22 GCs, with star ID and coordinates, for easy check and reproduction, as it should be in science papers.</description>

      <title>Determination method of binary fractions by the integrated spectrum</title>

Abstract: We need to resolve the individual stars for binary fraction determinations of stellar systems. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the binary fractions for dense or distant stellar systems. % We proposed a method to determine the binary fraction of a dense or distant stellar system. The method is to first determine the binary fraction variation for any two adjacent regions and then add up those binary fraction variations along the radial direction to obtain the binary fraction for a stellar system. Binary fraction variation is derived by using ten binary fraction-sensitive spectral absorption feature indices (SAFIs) and the binary fraction variation calibrations in terms of these SAFIs. Using this method, we first presented the binary fraction variations for twenty-one Galactic globular clusters (GCs). By comparisons, we find that they agree well with the binary fractions based on the main-sequence fiducial line method by previous studies. This verifies that the above mentioned method is feasible. Next, we presented the binary fraction variations of thirteen Galactic GCs. We gave the relationships between binary fraction and various parameters, and found that binary fraction is negatively correlated with NHB and NRR, binary fraction of some studies is not strongly correlated with NBS, and the number of GCs with large binary fraction is greater at extreme blue horizontal branch population ratio. At last, if we want to obtain more accurate binary fraction, we suggest that the spectroscopic and photometric observations are conducted at an appropriate area interval for a stellar system.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: No sign of multiple stellar populations in open clusters from their sodium and oxygen abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys</description>

      <title>A search for Galactic post-AGB stars in Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. When low and intermediate-mass stars leave the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, and before they reach the Planetary Nebulae stage, they enter a very brief and rather puzzling stellar evolutionary stage named post-AGB.
  Aims. To provide a reliable catalogue of galactic post-AGB stars together with their physical and evolutionary properties obtained through Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry.
  Methods. We started by identifying post-AGB stars or possible candidates from the bibliography with their Gaia DR3 counterpart sources. Using the available photometry, interstellar extinction, literature spectroscopically derived temperatures or spectral types and parallax-derived distances from Gaia DR3, we fitted their Spectral Energy Distributions and we estimated their luminosities and circumstellar extinctions. When compared to models, luminosity values allowed us to disclose objects that are likely post-AGB stars from other target types. Their position on the HR diagram allows direct comparison with updated post-AGB evolutionary tracks and an estimation of their masses and evolutionary ages.
  Results. We obtained a sample of 69 reliable post-AGB candidates that meet our classification criteria, providing their coordinates, distances, effective temperature, total extinction, luminosity, mass, and evolutionary age. In addition, similar data for other stellar objects in our initial compilation, such as supergiant stars or young stellar objects, is provided.
  Conclusions. We have filtered out the data that have the best precision in parallaxes and distances to obtain more accurate luminosities, which allows us to classify with confidence the objects of the sample among different stellar phases. This allows us to provide a small but reliable sample of post-AGB objects. Derived mean evolutionary time and average mass values are in agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Single and merger soliton dynamics in scalar field dark matter with and without self-interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results III. Implications for cosmic molecular gas content at "Cosmic Half-past Eleven"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Vicinity of Supermassive Black Holes with Gravitational Microlensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the near future, wide field surveys will discover 1000's of new strongly lensed quasars, and these will be monitored with unprecedented cadence by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Many of these will undergo caustic-crossing microlensing events over the 10-year LSST survey, in which a sharp caustic feature from a stellar body in the lensing galaxy crosses the inner accretion disk. Caustic-crossing events offer the unique opportunity to probe the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole for 100s of quasars with multi-platform follow-up triggered by LSST monitoring. To prepare for these observations, we have developed detailed simulations of caustic-crossing light curves. These employ a realistic analytic model of the inner accretion disk that reveals the strong surface brightness asymmetries introduced when fully accounting for both special- and general-relativistic effects. We demonstrate that an inflection in the caustic-crossing light curve due to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) can be detected in reasonable follow-up observations and can be analyzed to constrain ISCO size. We also demonstrate that a convolutional neural network can be trained to predict ISCO size more reliably than traditional approaches and can also recover source orientation with high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Binary pulsars can be used to probe Galactic potential gradients through calculating their line-of-sight accelerations. We present the first data release of direct line-of-sight acceleration measurements for 29 binary pulsars. We validate these data with a local acceleration model, and compare our results to those from earlier works. We find evidence for an acceleration gradient in agreement with these values, with our results indicating a local disk density of $\rho_\mathrm{d} = 0.040_{-0.020}^{+0.020} \ \mathrm{M_\odot}\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$. We also find evidence for unmodeled noise of unknown origin in our data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have mapped the magnetic field ($B$-field) for a region of about 30 pc around the centre of our Galaxy, which encompasses the circumnuclear disk (CND), the minispiral, and the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, using thermal dust polarization observations obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/SCUPOL. We decompose the spectra of $^{12}$CO ($J\!=\!3\!\rightarrow\!2$) transition from this region into individual cloud components and find the polarization observed at different wavelengths might be tracing completely different layers of dust along the line of sight. We use modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods to measure the strength of $B$-field projected in the plane of the sky ($B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}$). The mean $B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}$ of the CND and the minispiral, probed at 53 $\mu$m is of the order of $\sim\!2$ mG. $B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}\!\!\!&lt;\!1$ mG close to the Galactic Centre, in the region of the ionized mini-cavity within the CND, and increases outwards. However, the longer wavelength polarization at 216 $\mu$m appears to come from a dust layer that is cooler and behind the CND and has a stronger $B$-field of about 7 mG. The $B$-field strength is lowest along the Eastern Arm of the minispiral, which is also the only region with Alfv\'en Mach number, $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{A}}&gt;1$ and mass-to-flux ratio, $\lambda\!\gtrsim\!1$. Such an observed weak $B$-field could be a result of the low resolution of the observation, where the tangled $B$-fields due to the strong turbulence in the high density clumps of the CND are lost within the beam size of the observation.</description>

      <title>Understanding the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxies and its cosmological evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the redshift evolution of the radio luminosity function (RLF) of star-forming galaxies using GALFORM, a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a dynamo model of the magnetic field evolving in a galaxy. Assuming energy equipartition between the magnetic field and cosmic rays, we derive the synchrotron luminosity of each sample galaxy. In a model where the turbulent speed is correlated with the star formation rate, the RLF is in fair agreement with observations in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. At larger redshifts, the structure of galaxies, their interstellar matter and turbulence appear to be rather different from those at $z\lesssim2$, so that the turbulence and magnetic field models applicable at low redshifts become inadequate. The strong redshift evolution of the RLF at $0 \leq z \leq 2$ can be attributed to an increased number, at high redshift, of galaxies with large disc volumes and strong magnetic fields. On the other hand, in models where the turbulent speed is a constant or an explicit function of $z$, the observed redshift evolution of the RLF is poorly captured. The evolution of the interstellar turbulence and outflow parameters appear to be major (but not the only) drivers of the RLF changes. We find that both the small- and large-scale magnetic fields contribute to the RLF but the small-scale field dominates at high redshifts. Polarisation observations will therefore be important to distinguish these two components and understand better the evolution of galaxies and their nonthermal constituents.</description>

Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, weapplied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe the DarkLensCode (DLC), an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $4.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3} M_\odot$ located at $1.14^{+0.75}_{-0.57}\,\text{kpc}$ or $11.1^{+10.3}_{-4.7} M_\odot$ located at $1.31^{+0.80}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stars as a Means of Rapid Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe</title>

Abstract: JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, providing further evidence for "direct collapse" black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive ($\sim 10^{3-5} M_{\odot}$) SMBH seeds are generated within a few Myr as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate "quasi-star" phase that accompanies some direct collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, $\sim 1\%$ of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, "saturated-convection" region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of $\sim 60\%$ the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2\% of the mass (with the remaining $\sim 38\%$ in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of $20-40$ Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, consistent with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent modelling of the Milky Way structure using live potentials</title>

Abstract: To advance our understanding of the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, numerical models of Milky Way (MW) type galaxies are widely used. However, most models only vaguely resemble the MW (e.g. in total mass), and often use imposed analytic potentials (which cannot evolve dynamically). This poses a problem in asserting their applicability for the interpretation of observations of our own Galaxy. The goal of this work is to identify a numerical model that is not only a MW-type galaxy, but one that can mimic some of the main observed structures of our Galaxy, using dynamically evolving potentials, so that it can be used as a base model to study the ISM cycle in a galaxy like our own. This paper introduces a suite of 15 MW-type galaxy models developed using the {\sc arepo} numerical code, that are compared to Galactic observations of $^{12}$CO and \ion{H}{I} emission via longitude-velocity plots, from where we extract and compare the skeletons of major galactic features and the terminal gas velocities. We found that our best-fitting model to the overall structure, also reproduces some of the more specific observed features of the MW, including a bar with a pattern speed of $30.0 \pm 0.2$ km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$, a bar half-length of $3.2 \pm 0.8$\,kpc. Our model shows large streaming motions around spiral arms, and strong radial motions well beyond the inner bar. This model highlights the complex motions of a dynamic MW-type galaxy and has the potential to offer valuable insight into how our Galaxy regulates the ISM and star formation.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of black hole formation via collisions in stellar systems: An analysis of data from simulations and observations</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical relation between star clusters and black holes within, focusing on the potential role of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), globular clusters (GCs), and ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) as environments that allow for black hole formation via stellar collisions. This study aims to identify the optimal conditions for stellar collisions across a range of stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. We analyze data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and evolution scenarios. We computed a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. We find that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit a high efficiencies in terms of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies via a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs, GCs, and NSCs as environments conducive to the black hole formation scenario via stellar collisions. The defined black hole formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of the initial stellar mass to the critical mass.</description>

      <title>From Stellar Nurseries to Old Stellar Populations: A Multi-wavelength Case of NGC 1055</title>

Abstract: Given the complex nature of galaxies' interstellar medium (ISM), multi-wavelength data are required to probe the interplay among gas, dust, and stellar populations. Spiral galaxies are ideal laboratories for such a goal as they are rich in gas and dust. Using carbon monoxide (CO) along with GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) and Spitzer near-infrared (NIR) data we probe the correlations amongst the properties of stellar populations, gas, and dust over the disc of the spiral galaxy NGC~1055 at multiple angular resolutions, i.e. 2, 4, and 17 arcsec corresponding to a linear size of 144 pc, 288 pc, and 1.2 kpc, respectively. Our results indicate an asymmetry in the physical conditions along the galaxy's disc, i.e. the gas is slightly more extended and brighter, and molecular gas mass is higher on the disc's eastern side than the western side. All physical properties (i.e. molecular gas mass, CO line ratios, stellar mass, NIR emission) decrease from the centre going outwards in the disc with some exceptions (i.e. the extinction, FUV radiation, and the [3.6]-[4.5] colour). Our analysis indicates that the colour gets bluer (metallicity increases) halfway through the disc, then redder (metallicity decreases) going outwards further in the disc.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of PTA sources from cosmological initial conditions</title>

Abstract: Recent results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries (BHBs). While the data do not yet constrain the slope of the spectrum, this appears to flatten at the lowest frequencies, deviating from the power-law shape expected for circular binaries evolving solely due to gravitational wave (GW) emission. Interestingly, such flattening can be explained with a population of eccentric rather than circular binaries. The eccentricity of BHBs is notoriously difficult to predict based simply on the parameters of the host galaxies and the initial galactic orbit, as it is subject to stochastic effects. We study the evolution of the eccentricity of BHBs formed in galactic mergers with cosmological initial conditions from pairing to coalescence, with a focus on potential PTA sources. We select galactic mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation and re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. We then estimate coalescence timescales with a semi-analytical model of the evolution under the effects of GW emission and stellar hardening. We find that most mergers in IllustrisTNG100-1 occur on highly eccentric orbits, and that the eccentricity of BHBs at binary formation correlates with the initial eccentricity of the merger, if this is no larger than approximately 0.9. For extremely eccentric mergers, the binaries tend to form with modest eccentricities. We discuss the implications of these results on the interpretation of the observed GWB.</description>

      <title>Carbon monoxide and ionized carbon line emission global signals: foregrounds and targets for absolute microwave spectrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abr.) We consider the potential of future microwave spectrometers akin to PIXIE in light of the sky-averaged global signal expected from the total intensity of extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) and ionized carbon ([CII]) line emission. We start from models originally developed for forecasts of line-intensity mapping (LIM) observations targeting the same line emission at specific redshifts, extrapolating them across all of cosmic time. We then calculate Fisher forecasts for uncertainties on parameters describing relic spectral deviations, the CO/[CII] global signal, and a range of other Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds considered in previous work. We find that the measurement of the CO/[CII] global signal with a future CMB spectrometer presents an exciting opportunity to constrain the evolution of metallicity and molecular gas in galaxies across cosmic time. From PIXIE to its enhanced version, SuperPIXIE, microwave spectrometers would have the fundamental sensitivity to constrain the redshift evolution of average kinetic temperature and cosmic molecular gas density at a level of 10% to 1%, respectively. Taking a spectral distortion-centric perspective, when combined with other foregrounds, sky-averaged CO/[CII] emission can mimic $\mu$- and to a lesser extent $y$-type distortions. Under fiducial parameters, marginalising over the CO/[CII] model parameters increases the error on $\mu$ by $\simeq86$%, and the error on $y$ by $\simeq10$%. Incorporating information from planned CO LIM surveys can recover some of this loss in precision. Future work should deploy a more general treatment of the microwave sky to quantify in more detail the potential synergies between PIXIE-like and CO LIM experiments, which complement each other strongly in breadth versus depth, and ways to optimise both spectrometer and LIM surveys to improve foreground cleaning and maximise the science return for each.</description>

      <title>Identification of multi-component LOFAR sources with multi-modal deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-sensitivity radio telescopes are discovering an increased number of resolved sources with intricate radio structures and fainter radio emissions. These sources often present a challenge because source detectors might identify them as separate radio sources rather than components belonging to the same physically connected radio source. Currently, there are no reliable automatic methods to determine which radio components are single radio sources or part of multi-component sources. We propose a deep learning classifier to identify those sources that are part of a multi-component system and require component association on data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). We combine different types of input data using multi-modal deep learning to extract spatial and local information about the radio source components: a convolutional neural network component that processes radio images is combined with a neural network component that uses parameters measured from the radio sources and their nearest neighbours. Our model retrieves 94 per cent of the sources with multiple components on a balanced test set with 2,683 sources and achieves almost 97 per cent accuracy in the real imbalanced data (323,103 sources). The approach holds potential for integration into pipelines for automatic radio component association and cross-identification. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can be used to integrate different types of data and create an effective solution for managing modern radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>
