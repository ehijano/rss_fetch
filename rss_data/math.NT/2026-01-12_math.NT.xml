      <title>New perspectives on $p$-adic regulator formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the proof of the $p$-adic regulator formula for Asai--Flach classes to the finite slope case, without using finite polynomial cohomology. Moreover, we simplify the analogous computation for diagonal classes, relying on a pullback construction inspired by recent work of Sangiovanni-Vincentelli--Skinner.</description>

      <title>Local information of ADC quadratic lattices over algebraic number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we mainly determine the structures, counting formulas, and density sets of representations for binary and ternary ADC quadratic lattices over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields.
  In the binary case, we show that under certain conditions, there are finitely many primitive positive definite ADC lattices and infinitely many non-primitive ones. We also provide concise formulas for local densities and masses using invariants from BONGs theory, and show that these invariants completely determine the local densities over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Moreover, we compute the corresponding local quantities for ADC lattices over algebraic number fields.
  In the ternary case, we characterize the codeterminant set of spinor exceptions and integral spinor norm groups for ADC lattices over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Based on these results, we further establish some sufficient conditions on indefinite ADC lattices over algebraic number fields.</description>

      <title>Unlikely intersections with CM abelian varieties in a family and explicit bounds for canonical heights under endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and let $\mathcal{A} \to S$ be an abelian scheme with a curve $C \subset \mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In 2020, Barroero and Capuano proved that if $C$ is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme, then the intersection of $C$ with the union of the flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ of codimension at least 2 is finite. In this article, we continue to study this problem by considering the intersections with the algebraic subgroups of the CM fibers, generalizing a previous result of Barroero for fibered powers of elliptic schemes. A key ingredient of the proof is an explicit control of canonical heights under endomorphisms: for an abelian variety $A/\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, an ample symmetric divisor $D$, and $f \in \mathrm{End}(A)$, we bound explicitly $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(f(P))$ in terms of $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(P)$ by determining the values of $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ for which the divisors $\lambda D - f^* D$ and $f^* D - \lambda D$ are ample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of work on combinatorial inequalities related to hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions. In this short note, we give a proof using generating functions for a result proved by Singh and Barman (2026) using combinatorial methods. In addition, we give an alternate proof of another result of Singh \&amp; Barman (2024) which yields as a corollary a previously unobserved connection of hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions with certain distinct parts partitions.</description>

      <title>The low degree cohomology of compactifications of $A_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the low degree $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of symplectic local systems on the Satake compactification of the moduli space $A_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. We prove that only a small finite list of irreducible Galois representations can appear in the low degree cohomology of any nonsingular toroidal compactification of $A_g$ or $X_{g,s}$, the $s$-fold fiber product of the universal abelian variety. We give several applications, including to spaces of holomorphic forms on toroidal compactifications and to the cohomology of the interior. In particular, we give a complete characterization of when the cohomology of $X_{g,s}$, or one of its toroidal compactifications, is of Tate type. The result is independent of the choice of toroidal compactification.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov spectrum for Schneider map on $p\mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic formalism associated with the Schneider map on the p-adic integers $p\mathbb{Z}_p$ . By introducing a geometric potential that captures the expansion of cylinder sets generated by the map, we define a Lyapunov exponent adapted to this non-Archimedean setting. We investigate the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum and show that it is real analytic on its natural domain. Moreover, we obtain an explicit closed formula for the spectrum. As a consequence, we recover and refine known results on the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by a prescribed asymptotic arithmetic mean of the continued fraction digits. Finally, we relate the Lyapunov exponent to the exponential rate of convergence of rational approximations arising from truncations of the Schneider continued fraction expansion. This provides a $p$-adic analogue of classical results from Diophantine approximation and yielding precise dimension formulas for the associated level sets.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces in Hesse form and explicit isogeny formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method for the computation of $(3,3)$-isogenies between principally polarized abelian surfaces. The idea is to work with models in $\mathbb{P}^8$ induced by a symmetric level-$3$ theta structure. In this setting, the action of three-torsion points is linear, and the isogeny formulas can be described in a simple way as the composition of easy-to-evaluate maps. In the description of these formulas, the relation with the Burkhardt quartic threefold plays an important role. Furthermore, we discuss generalizations of the idea to higher dimensions as well as different isogeny degrees.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of parity bias in integer partitions has been studied by several authors. We continue this study here, but for non-unitary partitions (namely, partitions with parts greater than $1$). We prove analogous results for these restricted partitions to those that have been obtained by Kim, Kim, and Lovejoy (2020) and Kim and Kim (2021). We also look at inequalities between two classes of partitions studied by Andrews (2019), where the parts are separated by parity (either all odd parts are smaller than all even parts or vice versa).</description>

Abstract: We study deformation theory of mod $p$ Galois representations of $p$-adic fields with values in generalised reductive group schemes, such as $L$-groups and $C$-groups. We show that the corresponding deformation rings are complete intersections of expected dimension. We determine their irreducible components in many cases and show that they and their special fibres are normal and complete intersection.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we derive better results concerning powered numbers in short intervals, both unconditionally and conditionally on the $abc$-conjecture. We make use of sieve method, a polynomial identity, and a recent breakthrough result on density of sets with no $k$-term arithmetic progression. In the process, we study integers over short intervals that have with a big smooth divisor.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Ramanujan's Classic $\pi$ Formula</title>

Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan presented a collection of 17 elegant and rapidly converging formulae for $\pi$. Among these, one of the most celebrated is the following series: \[\frac{1}{\pi}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{26390n+1103}{\left(n!\right)^4} \frac{\left(4n\right)!}{396^{4n}}\] In this paper, we give a full proof of this classic formula using hypergeometric series and a special type of lattice sums due to Zucker and Robertson. We will also use some results by Dirichlet and Edwards in algebraic number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ ring homomorphisms into an algebraic closure from an \'etale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugall\'e and the second-named author, building on work of Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory.</description>

Abstract: The sequence $$ \mathbb{P}^{(c)}=(\lfloor p^c \rfloor)_{p\in \mathbb{P}}\quad (c&gt;0,c\notin \mathbb{N}), $$ is an important subsequence of the well-known Piatetski-Shapiro sequence, where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function. We prove that for all $c \in (0, 13/15)$, any large enough integer $N$ can be represented as
  $$
  N=\lfloor p^c\rfloor+q,
  $$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. We also prove the result holds for almost all fixed positive $c \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, we investigate shifted primes in this sequence, obtaining an asymptotic formula for all $c \in (0, 13/15)$ and an almost-all result for fixed positive $c \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that deformation rings $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$ of $G$-pseudocharacters of a profinite group $\Gamma$ are noetherian, when $\Gamma$ satisfies Mazur's finiteness condition. The proof proceeds by reduction to the case when $\Gamma$ is finitely generated, where the result was previously established by the second author. This enables us to extend our work on moduli spaces of $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$-condensed representations of a finitely generated profinite group $\Gamma$, to the groups satisfying Mazur's finiteness condition. We also show that the functor from rigid analytic spaces over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to sets, which associates to a rigid space $Y$ the set of continuous $\mathcal{O}(Y)$-valued $G$-pseudocharacters of $\Gamma$ is representable by a quasi-Stein rigid analytic space, and we study its general properties. We expect these results to be useful, when studying global Galois representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor numeration systems via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor numeration systems. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of MacMahon Series via Cyclotomic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</description>

      <title>Two algebraic proofs of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ based on formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Using formal power series, we then give two algebraic semiformal proofs of this result. The first proof is a specialization of the proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem given by Beukers, B\'ezivin and Robba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. We explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, it avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [7].</description>

      <title>The Voronoi Spherical CDF for Lattices and Linear Codes: New Bounds for Quantization and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</description>
