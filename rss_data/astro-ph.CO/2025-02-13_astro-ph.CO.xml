      <title>A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1$\%$ level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of $\Delta\mu$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys) mag (9$\%$ in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Measuring the redshift-space distortions by cross-correlating the density fields before and after reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical model for the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density field before and after standard baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction. Using this model, we extract the redshift-space distortion (RSD) parameter from the cross-power spectrum. The model is validated against a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Field-level inference of $H_0$ from simulated type Ia supernovae in a local Universe analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two particular challenges face type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) as probes of the expansion rate of the Universe. One is that they may not be fair tracers of the matter velocity field, and the second is that their peculiar velocities distort the Hubble expansion. Although the latter has been estimated at $\lesssim1.5\%$ for $z&gt;0.023$, this is based either on constrained linear or unconstrained non-linear velocity modelling. In this paper, we address both challenges by incorporating a physical model for the locations of supernovae, and develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that accounts for non-linear peculiar velocities in our local Universe, inferred from a Bayesian analysis of the 2M++ spectroscopic galaxy catalogue. With simulated data, the model recovers the ground truth value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the presence of peculiar velocities including their correlated uncertainties arising from the Bayesian inference, opening up the potential of including lower redshift SNeIa to measure $H_0$. Ignoring peculiar velocities, the inferred $H_0$ increases minimally by $\sim 0.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the range $0.023&lt;z&lt;0.046$. We conclude it is unlikely that the $H_0$ tension originates in unaccounted-for non-linear velocity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the weak lensing mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters in the LSST DESC DC2 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster scaling relations are key ingredients in cluster abundance-based cosmological studies. In optical cluster cosmology, weak gravitational lensing has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the cluster mass-richness relation. This work is conducted as part of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), which aims to analyze the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of Vera C. Rubin Observatory, starting in 2026. Weak lensing-inferred cluster properties, such as mass, suffer from several sources of bias. In this paper, we aim to test the impact of modeling choices and observational systematics in cluster lensing on the inference of the mass-richness relation. We constrain the mass-richness relation of 3,600 clusters detected by the redMaPPer algorithm in the cosmoDC2 extra-galactic mock catalog (covering $440$ deg$^2$) of the LSST DESC DC2 simulation, using number count measurements and stacked weak lensing profiles in several intervals of richness ($20 \leq \lambda \leq 200$) and redshift ($0.2 \leq z \leq 1$). By modeling the mean of the scaling relation as $\langle \ln \lambda|M_{\rm 200c}, z\rangle = \ln\lambda_0 + \mu_z\log[(1+z)/(1+0.5)] + \mu_m[\log_{10}(M_{\rm 200c}) - 14.3]$, our baseline constraints are $\ln\lambda_0 = 3.37\pm 0.03$, $\mu_z = 0.08\pm 0.07$ and $\mu_m = 2.18 \pm 0.07$. We have found that, for a LSST-like source galaxy density, our constraints are robust to a change in concentration-mass relation and dark matter density profile modeling choices, when source redshifts and shapes are perfectly known. We have found that photometric redshift uncertainties can introduce bias at the $1\sigma$ level, which can be mitigated by an overall correcting factor, fitted jointly with scaling parameters. We find that including positive shear-richness covariance in the fit shifts the results by up to 0.5$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as cosmological proxies: estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in cosmology is the Hubble tension, a discrepancy in the predicted expansion rate of the Universe. We leverage the sensitivity of the Dispersion Measure (DM) from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Hubble factor to investigate the Hubble tension. We build a catalog of 98 localized FRBs and an independent mock catalog and employ 3 methods to calculate the best value of the $H_0$: i) the mean of $H_0$ values obtained through direct calculation, ii) the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and iii) the reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history $H(z)$ using two DM-$z$ relations. When the confirmed FRBs is employed, our predictions are compatible with reports from the Planck+2018, with $H_0=65.13\pm2.52\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $57.67\pm11.99\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for MLE and the arithmetic mean, respectively. If we assume a linear and a power-law function for the DM-$z$ relation, our predictions for $H_0$ are $51.27^{+3.80}_{-3.31}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $77.09^{+8.89}_{-7.64}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively. Using 100 mock catalogs of simulated FRBs, we obtain larger values for $H_0$ with all methods considered: $H_{0;\text{ Like}}=67.30\pm0.91\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Mean}}=66.21\pm3.46\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Median}}=66.10\pm1.89\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{Linear}}=54.34\pm1.57\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_{0;\text{Power-law}}=91.84\pm1.82\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for the MLE, the arithmetic mean, and linear and power-law $\text{DM}-z$ relations, respectively. Our results for mock FRB catalogs increase the statistical precision, ranging from 1.4\% to 5.2\% for the MLE and arithmetic mean. Our result with the MLE applied to synthetic FRBs is at the same level of precision as reports from SH0ES. The increase in the number of confirmed FRBs will provide us, in combination with other observations, a robust prediction of the value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Testing the growth of cosmic structures during the Dark Ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping offers the unique opportunity to access the Dark Ages and trace the formation and evolution of the large scale structure of the Universe prior to star and galaxy formation. In this work we investigate the potential of future Earth- and Moon-based 21-cm surveys to constrain the growth of structures during the currently unexplored redshift range $30 &lt; z &lt; 200$. On the one hand we show how foregrounds limit the capabilities of Earth-based instruments in achieving precision below $10\%$ level. On the other hand, observations from the far side of the Moon, not affected by foregrounds generated by Earth's atmosphere, will reach percent or even sub-percent precision in terms of reconstructing the growth of cosmic structures. Such remarkable precision will improve by orders of magnitude parameter constraints on models that induce deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, not only during the Dark Ages, but also during recombination or that manifests mostly in the low-redshift Universe, like Early Dark Energy and nDGP models. Thus, because of their insensitivity to non-linearities or astrophysical processes, line intensity mapping surveys will provide a formidable consistency check to potential claims of discoveries of new physics that affect the growth of structures.</description>

      <title>Gauge hierarchy and metastability from Higgs-driven crunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on a dynamical vacuum selection mechanism in a landscape which scans the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>

      <title>$f(T)$ Gravity: Background Dependence and Propagating Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, rooted in General Relativity (GR), has achieved remarkable success, yet it still faces unresolved issues like the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. These challenges might imply the need for alternative gravitational theories. Teleparallel gravity offers a compelling framework by reformulating the gravitational interaction using torsion, rather than curvature, as its fundamental geometrical property. This paper delves into $f(T)$ gravity, an extension of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which introduces non-linear modifications of the torsion scalar $T$. We focus on the role of spacetime-dependent Lorentz transformations in the vierbein formalism, examining their impact on both background solutions and perturbation dynamics. Special attention is given to the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime, as well as the anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime. Furthermore, the analysis of the propagating degrees of freedom on these spacetimes is performed. While it is well established that TEGR reproduces the same results as GR, the propagating degrees of freedom in its non-linear extension, $f(T)$ gravity, is still debated in the literature. In this work, we find that only two fields propagate in the gravity sector, independently of the background spacetime considered, either FLRW or Bianchi I. Although not definitive, this paper provides fresh insights into the issue of the propagating degrees of freedom in $f(T)$ gravity, opening the door to intriguing new directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>The stellar mass composition of galaxy clusters and dependencies on dark matter halo properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 700 clusters from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation ($M_{200}\geq5\times10^{13} \,M_{\odot}$ at (z=0)) to examine the radial stellar mass distribution of their central objects, consisting of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intracluster light (ICL). The BCG+ICL mass fraction weakly anticorrelates with $M_{200}$, but strongly correlates with the concentration, $c_{200}$, the assembly redshift, $z_{50}$, and the mass gap between the most massive and the fourth more massive member, $\Delta M_{\rm \ast, 4th}$. We explore different aperture radii to nominally separate the ICL from the BCG and calculate ICL fractions. For $r_{\rm{ap}}=2r_{\rm half}$, where $r_{\rm half}$ is the radius containing half the BCG+ICL mass, the ICL fraction is nearly independent of $M_{200}$, $c_{200}$, and $z_{50}$ with values $M_{\ast,\rm ICL}/(M_{\ast,\rm ICL}+M_{\ast,\rm BCG})= 0.33\pm0.03$. Including the stellar mass of the satellites, the fraction $M_{\ast,\rm ICL}/(M_{\ast,\rm ICL}+M_{\ast,\rm BCG}+M_{\rm \ast,sat})$ weakly anticorrelates with $M_{200}$ and strongly correlates with $c_{200}$, $z_{50}$, and $\Delta M_{\rm \ast, 4th}$, suggesting that in more concentrated/earlier assembled/more relaxed clusters more stellar mass is lost from the satellites (by tidal stripping, and mergers) in favour of the ICL and BCG. Indeed, we find that ex-situ stars dominate both in the BCG and ICL masses, with mergers contributing more to the BCG, while tidal stripping contributes more to the ICL. We find that the difference between the projected and 3D ICL fractions are only a few per cent and suggest using $2r_{\rm half}$ to separate the ICL from the BCG in observed clusters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures Induced by Dark Fluid Accretion in Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark fluid accretion on gravitational waveforms emitted by a compact binary system consisting of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass black hole. Using a Lagrangian framework with 1~PN and 2.5~PN corrections, we analyze the effects of the spherically symmetric accretion of a fluid with steady-state flow, including those characterized by an equation of state parameter resembling dark energy, on the binary's dynamics.
  We validate our approach by comparing it with previous studies in the common region of validity and extend the analysis to include both local effects, such as dynamical friction, and global gravitational interactions with the stellar-mass black hole, focusing on their dependence on the fluid's properties. Our analysis reveals that these interactions induce de-phasing in gravitational waveforms, with the phase shift influenced by the fluid's equation of state and energy density. We also extend the study to sudden cosmological singularities, finding that, although they can deform the binary's orbit from initially circular to elliptical, their effect on de-phasing is negligible for cosmologically relevant energy densities. By incorporating both the local and global gravitational interactions of a fluid on a two-body system into the equations of motion, this preliminary study provides a framework for understanding the interplay between fluid dynamics and gravitational wave emissions in astrophysical systems.
  It further reinforces the potential for probing the properties of astrophysically relevant fluids through gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We explore likelihood-free (aka simulation-based) Bayesian model selection to quantify model comparison analyses of reionisation scenarios. We iteratively train the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on four toy EoR models based on 21cmFAST simulations with contrasting morphology to obtain summaries of the 21 cm lightcone. Within the pyDelfi framework, we replaced the Emcee sampler with MultiNest to integrate learnt posteriors and produce the Bayesian Evidence. We comfortably distinguish the model used to produce the mock data set in all cases. However, we struggle to produce accurate posterior distributions for outside-in reionisation models. After a variety of cross-checks and alternate analyses we discuss the flexibility of summarising models that differ from precisely the intended network training conditions as this should be more widely scrutinised before CNN can reliably analyse observed data.</description>

      <title>Probing modified gravitational-wave propagation with extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), namely binary systems composed of a massive black hole and a compact stellar-mass object, are anticipated to be among the gravitational wave (GW) sources detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Similarly to compact binary mergers detected by current GW detectors, EMRIs can be used as cosmic rulers to probe the expansion of the Universe. Motivated by tensions in current cosmological observations as well as by alternative models of dark energy, modified gravity theories can affect the propagation of GWs across cosmological distances, with modifications commonly parametrised in terms of two phenomenological parameters, $\Xi_0$ and $n$. In this work we adopt a Bayesian approach to constrain for the first time parametrised deviations from General Relativity using the loudest simulated EMRIs detected by LISA as dark sirens with a simulated galaxy catalog. Assuming all the cosmological parameters except $\Xi_0$ are already tightly constrained, our forecasts show that $\Xi_0$ can be constrained to a few percent level (90% C.I.) with 4 years of LISA observations, unless EMRI detection rates turn out to be closer to current pessimistic expectations. These results quickly degrade if additional cosmological parameters are inferred simultaneously, but become more robust with an extended LISA observation period of 10 years. Overall, we find that EMRIs with LISA are better at constraining modified GW propagation than current second-generation ground-based GW detectors, but they will only be comparable to third-generation detectors in the most optimistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Radiation Scattering Enhances CMB Phase Shift through Dark Matter-loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of CMB spectra is a characteristic signature for the presence of non-photon radiation propagating differently from photons, even when the radiation couples to SM particles solely gravitationally. It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\theta_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance. An increased $\theta_s$ and a suppressed matter power spectrum is therefore a generic feature of models containing dark matter scattering with abundant dark radiation.</description>

      <title>Joint Modelling of Astrophysical Systematics for Cosmology with LSST Cosmic Shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for jointly modelling the weak lensing source galaxy redshift distribution and the intrinsic alignment of galaxies via a shared luminosity function (LF). Considering this framework within the context of a Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Year 1 and Year 10 cosmic shear analysis, we first demonstrate the substantial impact of the LF on both source galaxy redshift distributions and the intrinsic alignment contamination. We establish how the individual parameters of a Schechter LF model impact the redshift distribution of a magnitude-limited sample, and we demonstrate the effect of marginalising over the LF parameters as incorporated in the intrinsic alignment modelling of a standard cosmic shear analysis set-up. We forecast the impact of our joint modelling framework on cosmological parameter constraints. Our preliminary results are promising, indicating that this framework can yield cosmological constraints consistent with those expected from standard analyses, enhanced by the flexibility of not fixing LF parameters. We plan to further validate these findings with comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to robustly quantify bias avoidance and underscore the framework's efficacy. Taking advantage of our forecasting results and the parameter degeneracies, we identify the specific impact of the shape of the LF of source galaxies on the cosmic shear data vector. We also discuss the potential of this method in providing a way to model generic selection functions in redshift distribution estimation, as well as its possibilities for extension to a 3x2pt analysis, particularly with respect to incorporating galaxy bias in this luminosity-function-based framework. Although we consider the context of LSST cosmic shear in this work, the proposed joint modelling framework is generically applicable to weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from an oscillating axion-like field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for isotropic cosmic birefringence with an axion-like field that rapidly oscillates during the recombination epoch. In conventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads to a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the EB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By introducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes incomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also results in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB observations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field responsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>An Analytically Tractable Marked Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing precision of cosmology data in the modern era is calling for methods to allow the extraction of non-Gaussian information using tools beyond two-point statistics. The marked power spectrum has the potential to extract beyond two-point information in a computationally efficient way while using much of the infrastructure already available for the power-spectrum. In this work we explore the marked power spectrum from an analytical perspective. In particular, we explore a low-order polynomial for the mark that allows us to better control the theoretical uncertainties and we show that with minimal new degrees of freedom the analytical results match measurements from N-body simulations for both the matter field and biased tracers in redshift space. Finally, we show that even within the limited forms of mark that we consider, there are degeneracies that can be broken by inclusion of the marked auto-spectrum or the cross-spectrum with the unmarked field. We discuss future theoretical developments that would enable us to apply this approach to survey data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints using Minkowski functionals from the first year data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Minkowski functionals to analyse weak lensing convergence maps from the first-year data release of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC-Y1) survey. Minkowski functionals provide a description of the morphological properties of a field, capturing the non-Gaussian features of the Universe matter-density distribution. Using simulated catalogs that reproduce survey conditions and encode cosmological information, we emulate Minkowski functionals predictions across a range of cosmological parameters to derive the best-fit from the data. By applying multiple scales cuts, we rigorously mitigate systematic effects, including baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. From the analysis, combining constraints of the angular power spectrum and Minkowski functionals, we obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{{\rm m}}/0.3} = {0.808}_{-0.046}^{+0.033}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = {0.293}_{-0.043}^{+0.157}$. These results represent a $40\%$ improvement on the $S_8$ constraints compared to using power spectrum only. \newtext{Minkowski functionals results are consistent with other two-point, and higher order statistics constraints using the same data, being in agreement with CMB results from the Planck $S_8$ measurements. Our study demonstrates the power of Minkowski functionals beyond two-point statistics to constrain and break the degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle is a cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology and shapes how we view the Universe and our place within it. It is imperative, then, to devise multiple observational tests which can identify and quantify possible violations of this foundational principle. One possible method of probing large-scale anisotropies involves the use of weak gravitational lensing. We revisit this approach in order to analyse the imprint of late-time anisotropic expansion on cosmic shear. We show that the cross-correlation of shear $E$- and $B$-modes on large scales can be used to constrain the magnitude (and possibly direction) of anisotropic expansion. We estimate the signal to noise for multipoles $10\lesssim \ell\lesssim 100$ that is achievable by a Euclid-like survey. Our findings suggest that such a survey could detect the $E$-$B$ signal for reasonable values of the late-time anisotropy parameter.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN $2023$aeax) at $z=2.15$ with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN $2023$aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-$z$ cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame $B-V\sim-0.3$) but with a normal decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)\sim1.25$), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN $2023$aeax luminosity distance is in $\sim0.1\sigma$ agreement with $\Lambda$CDM. SN $2023$aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at $z&gt;2$ (the other is SN $2023$adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN $2023$adsy ($B-V\sim0.8)$, SN $2023$aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN $2023$aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-$z$ SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;2$ SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a $\sim1\sigma$ distance slope relative to $\Lambda$CDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

Abstract: The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at $D \sim 40$ Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at $R \sim 40$ Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, $-0.03\pm0.02$ (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of $H_0$ = 73.3 $\pm$ 1.4 (stat) $\pm$ 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Dark Glueball Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New gauge forces can play an important role in the evolution of the early universe. In this work we investigate the cosmological implications of a pure Yang-Mills dark sector that is dominantly populated after primordial inflation. Such a dark sector takes the form of a bath of dark gluons at high temperatures, but confines at lower temperatures to produce a spectrum of dark glueballs. These glueballs then undergo a freezeout process such that the remnant population is nearly completely dominated by the lightest state. To reproduce the observed cosmology, this lightest glueball species must decay to the Standard Model to repopulate and reheat it. At leading order, this can occur through a connector operator of dimension-6. In contrast, other glueballs can be parametrically long-lived or stable, and remain as contributors to dark matter or modify the observed cosmology through their later decays. In this work we study the evolution of such dark sectors in detail. We demonstrate that stable remnant glueballs can produce the measured dark matter abundance. We also derive broad constraints on non-Abelian dark sectors from overproduction of remnant glueballs when they are stable or from their destructive impact when they are able to decay.</description>

      <title>TeV Scale Resonant Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. An imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from $N_{2}$ and triplet fermion decay through resonant leptogenesis scenario. The Yukawa coupling of triplet plays significant role both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The Muon $(g-2)$ and dark matter both favor the same parameter space for mass of the dark matter and the triplet fermion.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified 2791 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, at &gt;3$\sigma$ level, including 62 that are new $\gamma$-ray detections. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of 525 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources to study the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be robustly measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale power spectrum with gravitational-wave diffractive lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel way to probe subgalactic-scale matter distribution with diffractive lensing on gravitational waves. Five-year observations from Einstein Telescope and DECIGO are expected to probe $k= 10^5\sim 10^8 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ down to $P(k) = 10^{-16} \sim 10^{-14} \,{\rm Mpc}^3$ level. These results can be interpreted in terms of primordial black holes in the range $M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ down to $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-6}$ level, or QCD axion minihalos in the range $m_a = 10^{-3} \sim 10^{-12} \,{\rm eV}$. A key result of the paper is the approximate relation between the scale $k$ and the gravitational wave frequency $f$, derived in an ensemble of `multi-lensing' events. This relation enables direct measurement of the power spectrum at specific scales, with sensitivities characterized by model-independent kernels $\delta P(k)$. Additionally, we delineate the statistical properties of `multi-lensing' based on the `Fresnel number' $N_F$. When $N_F \gtrsim {\cal O}(1)$, the statistical significance can be approximately calculated by Variance of lensing effects, which is directly related to the power spectrum among other moments of matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>
