      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics can effectively identify misinformation sharing users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is costly and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Multiplex mobility network and metapopulation epidemic simulations of Italy based on Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03639v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The patterns of human mobility play a key role in the spreading of infectious diseases and thus represent a key ingredient of epidemic modeling and forecasting. Unfortunately, as the Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted, for the vast majority of countries there is no availability of granular mobility data. This hinders the possibility of developing computational frameworks to monitor the evolution of the disease and to adopt timely and adequate prevention policies. Here we show how this problem can be addressed in the case study of Italy. We build a multiplex mobility network based solely on open data, and implement a SIR metapopulation model that allows scenario analysis through data-driven stochastic simulations. The mobility flows that we estimate are in agreement with real-time proprietary data from smartphones. Our modeling approach can thus be useful in contexts where high-resolution mobility data is not available.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Prompt Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</description>

      <title>Explainable Hierarchical Urban Representation Learning for Commuting Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commuting flow prediction is an essential task for municipal operations in the real world. Previous studies have revealed that it is feasible to estimate the commuting origin-destination (OD) demand within a city using multiple auxiliary data. However, most existing methods are not suitable to deal with a similar task at a large scale, namely within a prefecture or the whole nation, owing to the increased number of geographical units that need to be maintained. In addition, region representation learning is a universal approach for gaining urban knowledge for diverse metropolitan downstream tasks. Although many researchers have developed comprehensive frameworks to describe urban units from multi-source data, they have not clarified the relationship between the selected geographical elements. Furthermore, metropolitan areas naturally preserve ranked structures, like cities and their inclusive districts, which makes elucidating relations between cross-level urban units necessary. Therefore, we develop a heterogeneous graph-based model to generate meaningful region embeddings at multiple spatial resolutions for predicting different types of inter-level OD flows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using real-world aggregated mobile phone datasets collected from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The results indicate that our proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of a uniform urban structure. We extend the understanding of predicted results using reasonable explanations to enhance the credibility of the model.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow-based modularity maximization for community detection in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two methods for the unsupervised detection of communities in undirected multiplex networks. These networks consist of multiple layers that record different relationships between the same entities or incorporate data from different sources. Both methods are formulated as gradient flows of suitable energy functionals: the first (MPBTV) builds on the minimization of a balanced total variation functional, which we show to be equivalent to multiplex modularity maximization, while the second (DGFM3) directly maximizes multiplex modularity. The resulting non-linear matrix-valued ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved efficiently by a graph Merriman--Bence--Osher (MBO) scheme. Key to the efficiency is the approximate integration of the discrete linear differential operators by truncated eigendecompositions in the matrix exponential function. Numerical experiments on several real-world multiplex networks show that our methods are competitive with the state of the art with respect to various metrics. Their major benefit is a significant reduction of computational complexity leading to runtimes that are orders of magnitude faster for large multiplex networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring publication relatedness using controlled vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications has important applications in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness because they address issues that arise when using citation or textual similarity to measure relatedness. While several controlled-vocabulary-based relatedness measures have been developed, there exists no comprehensive and direct test of their accuracy and suitability for different types of research questions. This paper reviews existing measures, develops a new measure, and benchmarks the measures using TREC Genomics data as a ground truth of topics. The benchmark test show that the new measure and the measure proposed by Ahlgren et al. (2020) have differing strengths and weaknesses. These results inform a discussion of which method to choose when studying interdisciplinarity, information retrieval, clustering of science, and researcher topic switching.</description>

      <title>The networks of ingredient combination in cuisines around the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating how different ingredients are combined in popular dishes is crucial to reveal the fundamental principles behind the formation of food preferences. Here, we use data from food repositories and network analysis to characterize worldwide cuisines. In our framework, each cuisine is represented as a network, where nodes correspond to ingredient types and weighted links describe how frequently pairs of ingredient types appear together in recipes. The networks of ingredient combinations reveal cuisine-specific patterns, highlighting similarities and differences in gastronomic preferences across different world regions. We find that popular ingredients, recurrent combinations, and the way they are organized within the backbone of the network provide a unique fingerprint for each cuisine. Hence, we demonstrate that networks of ingredient combinations are able to cluster global cuisines into meaningful geo-cultural groups, and can also be used to train models to uniquely identify a cuisine from a subset of its recipes. Our study advances our understanding of food combinations and helps uncover the geography of taste, paving the way for the creation of new and innovative recipes.</description>

      <title>Graph GOSPA metric: a metric to measure the discrepancy between graphs of different sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a metric to measure the dissimilarity between graphs that may have a different number of nodes. The proposed metric extends the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric, which is a metric for sets, to graphs. The proposed graph GOSPA metric includes costs associated with node attribute errors for properly assigned nodes, missed and false nodes and edge mismatches between graphs. The computation of this metric is based on finding the optimal assignments between nodes in the two graphs, with the possibility of leaving some of the nodes unassigned. We also propose a lower bound for the metric, which is also a metric for graphs and is computable in polynomial time using linear programming. The metric is first derived for undirected unweighted graphs and it is then extended to directed and weighted graphs. The properties of the metric are demonstrated via simulated and empirical datasets.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted advertising, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Docent: Instruction Tuning with Multimodal Large Language Model to Support Art Appreciation Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Art appreciation is vital in nurturing critical thinking and emotional intelligence among learners. However, traditional art appreciation education has often been hindered by limited access to art resources, especially for disadvantaged students, and an imbalanced emphasis on STEM subjects in mainstream education. In response to these challenges, recent technological advancements have paved the way for innovative solutions. This study explores the application of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in art appreciation education, focusing on developing LLaVA-Docent, a model that leverages these advancements. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature review and consultations with experts in the field, leading to developing a robust data framework. Utilizing this framework, we generated a virtual dialogue dataset that was leveraged by GPT-4. This dataset was instrumental in training the MLLM, named LLaVA-Docent. Six researchers conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations of LLaVA-Docent to assess its effectiveness, benchmarking it against the GPT-4 model in a few-shot setting. The evaluation process revealed distinct strengths and weaknesses of the LLaVA-Docent model. Our findings highlight the efficacy of LLaVA-Docent in enhancing the accessibility and engagement of art appreciation education. By harnessing the potential of MLLMs, this study makes a significant contribution to the field of art education, proposing a novel methodology that reimagines the way art appreciation is taught and experienced.</description>

      <title>"Sharing, Not Showing Off": How BeReal Approaches Authentic Self-Presentation on Social Media Through Its Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the pressures created by social media, such as heightened self-consciousness and the need for extensive self-presentation. In this study, we investigate how BeReal, a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical data, we propose design guidelines for platforms that support authentic self-presentation while fostering reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous photo-sharing. These guidelines aim to enable users to portray themselves more comprehensively and accurately, ultimately supporting teens' developmental needs, particularly in building authentic relationships.</description>
