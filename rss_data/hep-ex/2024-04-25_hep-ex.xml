      <title>First measurement of Gallium Arsenide as a low-temperature calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first measurement of a Gallium Arsenide crystal working as low-temperature calorimeter for direct Dark Matter (DM) searches within the DAREDEVIL (DARk-mattEr DEVIces for Low energy detection) project. In the quest for direct dark matter detection, innovative approaches to lower the detection thershold and explore the sub-GeV mass DM range, have gained high relevance in the last decade. This study presents the pioneering use of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as a low-temperature calorimeter for probing the dark matter-electron interaction channel. Our experimental setup features a GaAs crystal at ultralow temperature of 15 mK, coupled with a Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) thermal sensor for precise energy estimation. This configuration is the first step towards the detection of single electrons scattered by dark matter particles within the GaAs crystal, to significantly improve the sensitivity to low-mass dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter models involving an $s$-channel mediator with the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports a summary of searches for a fermionic dark matter candidate in the context of theoretical models characterised by a mediator particle exchange in the $s$-channel. The data sample considered consists of $pp$ collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider during its Run 2 at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding to up to 140 $fb^{-1}$. The interpretations of the results are based on simplified models where the new mediator particles can be spin-0, with scalar or pseudo-scalar couplings to fermions, or spin-1, with vector or axial-vector couplings to fermions. Exclusion limits are obtained from various searches characterised by final states with resonant production of Standard Model particles, or production of Standard Model particles in association with large missing transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Benchmark of deep-inelastic-scattering structure functions at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codes APFEL++ and HOPPET within the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Probing Hidden Leptonic Scalar Portals using the NA64 Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the NA64 experiment at CERN SPS to search for New Physics processes involving $e\rightarrow\mu$ transitions after the collision of 100 GeV electrons with target nuclei. A new Dark Sector leptonic portal in which a scalar boson $\varphi$ could be produced in the lepton-flavor-changing bremsstrahlung-like reaction, $eN\rightarrow \mu N\varphi$, is used as benchmark process. In this work, we develop a realistic Monte Carlo simulation of the NA64 experimental setup implementing the differential and total production cross-section computed at exact tree-level and applying the Weisz\"{a}cker-Williams phase space approximation. Using this framework, we investigate the main background sources and calculate the expected sensitivity of the experiment. The results indicate that with minor setup optimization, NA64 can probe a large fraction of the available parameter space compatible with the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the Dark Matter relic predictions in the context of a new Dark Sector leptonic portal with $10^{11}$ EOT. This result paves the way to the exploration of lepton-flavour-changing transitions in NA64.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings via $\boldsymbol{Z\gamma\,(\ell^+\ell^-\gamma)}$ Production at $\boldsymbol{e^+e^-}$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are absent in the Standard Model (SM) and at the dimension-6 level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), arising first from dimension-8 operators. As such, they provide a unique window for probing new physics beyond the SM. These dimension-8 operators can be mapped to nTGC form factors whose structure is consistent with the spontaneously-broken electroweak gauge symmetry of the SM. In this work, we study the probes of nTGCs in the reaction $e^+e^-\to Z\gamma$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-\,(\ell =e,\mu)$ at an $e^+e^-$ collider. We perform a detector-level simulation and analysis of this reaction at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with collision energy $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV and an integrated luminosity of 5 ab$^{-1}$. We present the sensitivity limits on probing the new physics scales of dimension-8 nTGC operators via measurements of the corresponding nTGC form factors.</description>

      <title>Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory: Rivet version 4 release note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rivet toolkit is the primary mechanism for phenomenological preservation of collider-physics measurements, containing both a computational core and API for analysis implementation, and a large collection of more than a thousand preserved analyses. In this note we summarise the main changes in the new Rivet 4 major release series. These include a major generalisation and more semantically coherent model for histograms and related data objects, a thorough clean-up of inelegant and legacy observable-computation tools, and new systems for extended analysis-data, incorporation of preserved machine-learning models, and serialization for high-performance computing applications. Where these changes introduce backward-incompatible interface changes, existing analyses have been updated and indications are given on how to update new analysis routines and workflows.</description>

      <title>CP conservation in the strong interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss matters related to the point that topological quantization in the strong interaction is a consequence of an infinite spacetime volume. Because of the ensuing order of limits, i.e. infinite volume prior to summing over topological sectors, CP is conserved. Here, we show that this reasoning is consistent with the construction of the path integral from steepest-descent contours. We reply to some objections that aim to support the case for CP violation in the strong interactions that are based on the role of the CP-odd theta-parameter in three-form effective theories, the correct sampling of all configurations in the dilute instanton gas approximation and the volume dependence of the partition function. We also show that the chiral effective field theory derived from taking the volume to infinity first is in no contradiction with analyses based on partially conserved axial currents.</description>

      <title>Experimental Limits on Solar Reflected Dark Matter with a New Approach on Accelerated-Dark-Matter-Electron Analysis in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a dark matter-electron (DM-electron) paradigm has drawn much attention. Models beyond the standard halo model describing DM accelerated by high energy celestial bodies are under intense examination as well. In this Letter, a velocity components analysis (VCA) method dedicated to swift analysis of accelerated DM-electron interactions via semiconductor detectors is proposed and the first HPGe detector-based accelerated DM-electron analysis is realized. Utilizing the method, the first germanium based constraint on sub-GeV solar reflected DM-electron interaction is presented with the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day dataset from the CDEX-10 experiment. In the heavy mediator scenario, our result excels in the mass range of 5$-$15 keV/$c^2$, achieving a 3 orders of magnitude improvement comparing with previous semiconductor experiments. In the light mediator scenario, the strongest laboratory constraint for DM lighter than 0.1 MeV/$c^2$ is presented. The result proves the feasibility and demonstrates the vast potential of the VCA technique in future accelerated DM-electron analyses with semiconductor detectors.</description>

      <title>Fast Inclusive Flavour Tagging at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of identifying B meson flavor at the primary interaction point in the LHCb detector is crucial for measurements of mixing and time-dependent CP violation. Flavour tagging is usually done with a small number of expert systems that find important tracks to infer the B meson flavour from. Recent advances show that replacing all of those expert systems with one ML algorithm that considers all tracks in an event yields an increase in tagging power. However, training the current classifier takes a long time and is not suitable for use in real-time triggers. In this work we present a new classifier, based on the DeepSet architecture. With the right inductive bias of permutation invariance, we achieve great speedups in training (multiple hours vs 10 minutes), a factor of 4-5 speed-up in inference for use in real time environments like the trigger and less tagging asymmetry. For the first time we investigate and compare performances of these Inclusive Flavor Taggers on simulation of the upgraded LHCb detector for the third run of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on U(1)' Models: from Non-Standard Interactions to Long-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of gauge bosons from a weakly coupled lepton flavor dependent $U(1)'$ interaction on the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos in the global analysis of oscillation data. The analysis is performed for interaction lengths ranging from the Sun-Earth distance to effective contact neutrino interactions. We survey $\sim 10000$ set of models characterized by the six relevant fermion $U(1)'$ charges and find that in all cases, constraints on the coupling and mass of the $Z'$ can be derived. We also find that about 5% of the $U(1)'$ model charges lead to a viable LMA-D solution but this is only possible in the contact interaction limit. We explicitly quantify the constraints for a variety of models including $U(1)_{B-3L_e}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{B-\frac{3}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{L_e-\frac{1}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$. We compare the constraints imposed by our oscillation analysis with the strongest bounds from fifth force searches, violation of equivalence principle as well as bounds from scattering experiments and white dwarf cooling. Our results show that generically, the oscillation analysis improves over the existing bounds from gravity tests for $Z'$ lighter than $\sim 10^{-8} \to 10^{-11}$ eV depending on the specific couplings. In the contact interaction limit, we find that for most models listed above there are values of $g'$ and $M_{Z'}$ for which the oscillation analysis provides constraints beyond those imposed by laboratory experiments. Finally we illustrate the range of $Z'$ and couplings leading to a viable LMA-D solution for two sets of models.</description>

      <title>SMEFiT: a flexible toolbox for global interpretations of particle physics data with effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a robust framework to interpret experimental measurements in the context of new physics scenarios while minimising assumptions on the nature of the underlying UV-complete theory. We present the Python open source SMEFiT framework, designed to carry out parameter inference in the SMEFT within a global analysis of particle physics data. SMEFiT is suitable for inference problems involving a large number of EFT degrees of freedom, without restrictions on their functional dependence in the fitted observables, can include UV-inspired restrictions in the parameter space, and implements arbitrary rotations between operator bases. Posterior distributions are determined from two complementary approaches, Nested Sampling and Monte Carlo optimisation. SMEFiT is released together with documentation, tutorials, and post-analysis reporting tools, and can be used to carry out state-of-the-art EFT fits of Higgs, top quark, and electroweak production data. To illustrate its functionalities, we reproduce the results of the recent ATLAS EFT interpretation of Higgs and electroweak data from Run II and demonstrate how equivalent results are obtained in two different operator bases.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP Violation beyond the Standard Model and the PQ Quality with Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), one of the leading low energy consequences of the model appears in the form of the chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) of the gluons and light quarks. We examine if these CEDMs can be distinguished from the QCD $\theta$-term through the experimentally measurable nucleon and atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in both cases with and without the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism solving the strong CP problem. We find that the nucleon EDMs can show a distinctive pattern when the EDMs are dominantly induced by light quark CEDMs without the PQ mechanism. In the presence of the PQ mechanism, the nucleon EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have a similar pattern as those due to the QCD $\theta$-parameter, regardless of the origin of the axion vacuum value which determines the $\theta$-parameter. In contrast, diamagnetic atomic EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have characteristic patterns distinguishable from the pattern due to the $\theta$-parameter which is induced dominantly by UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly, for instance by quantum gravity effects. Our results suggest that EDMs may provide information not only on CP violation beyond the SM, but also on the existence of the PQ mechanism and the quality of the PQ symmetry characterized by the strength of UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly.</description>

      <title>Predictions from scoto-seesaw with $A_4$ modular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper's novelty lies in introducing a hybrid scoto-seesaw model rooted in $A_4$ discrete modular symmetry leading to several interesting phenomenological implications. The scoto-seesaw framework leads to generation of one mass square difference $( \Delta m^2_{\rm atm}$) using the type-I seesaw mechanism at the tree level. Additionally, the scotogenic contribution is vital in obtaining the other mass square difference ($\Delta m^2 _{\rm sol}$) at the loop level, thus providing a clear interpretation of the two different mass square differences. The non-trivial transformation of Yukawa couplings under the $A_4$ modular symmetry helps to explore neutrino phenomenology with a specific flavor structure of the mass matrix. In addition to predictions for neutrino mass ordering, mixing angles and CP phases, this setup leads to precise predictions for $\sum m_i$ as well as $|m_{ee}|$. In particular, the model predicts $\sum m_i \in (0.073,0.097)$ eV and $\left| m_{ee}\right| \in (3.15,6.66)\times 10^{-3} $ eV range; within reach of upcoming experiments. Furthermore, our model is also promising for addressing lepton flavor violations, i.e., $\ell_\alpha \to \ell_\beta \gamma$, $\ell_\alpha \to 3\ell_\beta$ and $\mu - e $ conversion rates while staying within the realm of current experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Mass suppression effect in QCD radiation and hadron angular distribution in jet</title>

Abstract: The finite mass of the heavy quark suppresses the collimated radiations, which is generally referred to as the dead cone effect. In this paper, we study the distribution of hadron multiplicity over the hadron opening angle with respect to the jet axis in various flavors of jets. The corresponding measurement can be the most straightforward and simplest to explore the dynamical evolution of the radiations in the corresponding jet, which can expose the mass effect. We also propose the transverse energy-weighted angular distribution which sheds light on the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects in the radiation. With Monte-Carlo simulations, our calculation shows that the dead cone effect can be clearly seen by taking the ratio between the b jet and the light-quark (inclusive) jet, promising to be measured at the LHC in the future.</description>

      <title>High-volume tunable resonator for axion searches above 7 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from the first experimental demonstration of a tunable thin-shell axion haloscope. This novel geometry decouples the overall volume of the cavity-based resonator from its resonant frequency, thereby evading the steep sensitivity degradation at high-frequencies. An aluminum $2.6$ L ($41$ $\lambda^3$) prototype which tunes from $7.1$ to $8.0$ GHz was fabricated and characterized at room temperature. An axion-sensitive, straightforwardly tunable $\mathrm{TM}$$_{010}$ mode is clearly identified with a room temperature quality factor, $Q$, of $\sim$$5,000$. The on-resonance $E$-field distribution is mapped and found to agree with numerical calculations. Anticipating future cryogenic operation, we develop an alignment protocol relying only on rf measurements of the cavity, maintaining a form factor of $0.57$ across the full tuning range. These measurements demonstrate the feasibility of cavity-based haloscopes with operating volume $V\gg\lambda^3$. We discuss plans for future development and the parameters required for a thin-shell haloscope exploring the post-inflationary axion parameter space ($\sim$$4$ to $\sim$$30$ GHz) at DFSZ sensitivity.</description>
