      <title>Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture during extreme weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still several challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a future settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task, providing not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian weather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications require a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid response, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the feasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications during extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a ground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet. Long-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the southern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the feasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact in terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is based on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of the Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and undesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different environmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows for the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as global dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the recently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme conditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the proposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity during these events.</description>

      <title>Ground to Dust: Collisional Cascades and the Fate of Kardashev II Megaswarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraterrestrial intelligences are speculated to surround stars with structures to collect their energy or to signal distant observers. If they exist, these most likely are megaswarms, vast constellations of satellites (elements) in orbit around the hosts. Although long-lived megaswarms are extremely powerful technosignatures, they are liable to be subject to collisional cascades once guidance systems start failing. The collisional time is roughly an orbital period divided by the covering fraction of the swarm. Structuring the swarm orbits does not prolong the initial collisional time as long as there is enough randomness to ensure collisions, although it can reduce collision velocities. I further show that once the collisional cascade begins, it can develop extremely rapidly for hypervelocity collisions. Companion stars or planets in the stellar system induce perturbations through the Lidov-Kozai effect among others, which can result in orbits crossing within some millions of years. Radiative perturbations, including the Yarkovsky effect, also can destabilize swarms. Most megaswarms are thus likely to be short-lived on cosmic timescales without active upkeep. I discuss possible mitigation strategies and implications for megastructure searches.</description>

      <title>Biases from Missing a Small Planet in High Multiplicity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder the extent to which "missing" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our interpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a simple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove planets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture change. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then repeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying hyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as faithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the failure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced planets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially unaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is that the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the observation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection bias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the observed planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of the Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the interpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular spacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary architectures that reproduces these observed patterns.</description>

      <title>The Challenges of Detecting Gases in Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune K2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when the considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative models without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits to the observations. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific gas.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing and Duration Variations for the Discovery and Characterization of Exoplanets in the TESS era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.09849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transiting exoplanets in multi-planet systems have non-Keplerian orbits which can cause the times and durations of transits to vary. The theory and observations of transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) are reviewed. The Kepler spacecraft has detected several hundred perturbed planets, many of which are still undergoing further study, and now TESS is adding to this sample. In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own Solar System. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. Constraints on model parameters from timing are elucidated, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements in multi-transiting planetary systems, from which bulk compositions may be inferred. The progress being made in studying transit timing with TRAPPIST-1 and TESS multi-planet systems is reviewed, as well as what the future may hold.</description>

      <title>Dust Growth in ALMA Rings: II. Dusty Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annular substructures serve as ideal venues for planetesimal formation. In this series, we investigate the linear stage of dust growth within rings. The first paper examines the global streaming instability, while this study focuses on the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). We perform a linear analysis of the two-fluid equations on a background pressure bump, representing annular substructures. The spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} is used to solve the linear eigenvalue problem. We identify two distinct DRWI modes: Type I, which originates from dust-modified gas RWI, and Type II, which results from dust-gas coupling. These modes never coexist for a given azimuthal wavenumber $\ky$, but transition between each other as $\ky$ varies. Type I modes are driven by the advection of background vorticity, whereas Type II modes involve two primary waves: Rossby waves, driven by advection, and thin waves, driven by dust-gas drag. Finally, we assess the relevance of DRWI in ALMA rings using DSHARP sources. Our findings suggest that Type I modes could explain the absence of azimuthal asymmetries in many ALMA disks, whereas Type II modes are entirely absent in all eight observed rings, implying that unresolved narrow rings or alternative mechanisms may play a role in dust growth within annular substructures.</description>

      <title>Keplerian motion of a compact source orbiting the inner disc of PDS 70: a third protoplanet in resonance with b and c?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disc around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ~13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b &amp; c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disc emission at 0.95--1.65$\mu$m, which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\mu$m could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disc contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disc feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.</description>

      <title>General Analytic Solutions for Circumplanetary Disks during the Late Stages of Giant Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forming giant planets are accompanied by circumplanetary disks, as indicated by considerations of angular momentum conservation, observations of candidate protoplanets, and the satellite systems of planets in our Solar System. This paper derives surface density distributions for circumplanetary disks during the final stage of evolution when most of the mass is accreted. This approach generalizes previous treatments to include the angular momentum bias for the infalling material, more accurate solutions for the incoming trajectories, corrections to the outer boundary condition of the circumplanetary disk, and the adjustment of newly added material as it becomes incorporated into the Keplerian flow of the pre-existing disk. These generalizations lead to smaller centrifugal radii, higher column density for the surrounding envelopes, and higher disk accretion efficiency. In addition, we explore the consequences of different angular distributions for the incoming material at the outer boundary, with the concentration of the incoming flow varying from polar to isotropic to equatorial. These geometric variations modestly affect the disk surface density, but also lead to substantial modification to the location in the disk where the mass accretion rate changes sign. This paper finds analytic solutions for the orbits, source functions, surface density distributions, and the corresponding disk temperature profiles over the expanded parameter space outlined above.</description>

      <title>ExoALMA XIII. gas masses from N2H+ and C18O: a comparison of protoplanetary gas disk mass measurement techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.</description>
