      <title>Extension of the fusion power plant costing standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents the work of the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) International Working Group (IWG) on Fusion Cost Analysis in 2024-2025, and the methodological extensions implemented in the CATF-supported branch of the pyFECONs fusion power-plant costing framework. Using the standards-aligned chart-of-accounts and physics-to-economics workflow established by ARPA-E. The IWG development reorganizes and deepens the framework around three architecture-defining cost-driver tracks for Magnetic Fusion Energy (MFE), Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE), and Magneto-Inertial Fusion Energy (MIFE). In particular, the generic driver placeholder in Account 22.1.3 is treated as a controlled swap-point and replaced by a full cost-account development for the dominant driver in each class, enabling auditable traceability from requirements and geometry to rolled-up plant costs. On top of this driver-centric foundation, we introduce a probabilistic costing layer that compounds materials price uncertainty, TRL-based maturity uncertainty, and learning-curve uncertainty into cost distributions. We then describe safety-informed costing that enumerates fusion-relevant hazards and maps mitigating systems, structures, and provisions into standardized accounts, together with scenario-parameterized regulatory and financial adders. Finally, we document expanded macroeconomic and finance parameterization and a value-metrics module that complements LCOE with investment and planning measures (NPV, IRR MIRR, revenue requirements, WACC-based annualization, and residual and follow-on value), all computed from the same COA-mapped outputs. Collectively, these additions convert a deterministic, standards-aligned costing backbone into an extensible analysis environment suitable for transparent sensitivity studies, uncertainty propagation, and safety- and finance-coupled interpretation of fusion pilot-plant and NOAK scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emergence of opinion splits in the Sznajd model with latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modelling of social systems, opinion latency is the idea that once an agent changes its opinion, there will be a period of time where it is immune to other changes. When added to the voter model this leads to a situation where no matter how low the latency is or how many opinions are considered, all opinions end up in a coexistence where they are equally represented. In this work, we examine what happens when latency is added to the Sznajd model. What we find is that for low latency, the model behaves roughly like it does in the absence of latency, where one opinion will always eventually dominate. For high latency, the possibility for a symmetric coexistence of 2 opinions arises, but contrary to the voter model, a coexistence of more than 2 opinions is never stable. We provide evidence of this phenomenon with computer simulations of the model in Barab\'asi-Albert networks, together with a mean field treatment that is able to capture the observed behavior. We argue that this could hint at an explanation for the prevalence of two opinion splits in the real world.</description>

      <title>Group adaptation drives opinion dynamics in higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern interconnected societies, opinions and beliefs can quickly spread across large populations, giving rise to collective behaviors such as the adoption of social norms or polarization. These phenomena have motivated many models aimed at reproducing emergent properties from simple interaction mechanisms. In particular, opinion dynamics models describe how individual opinions evolve through interactions and study the conditions for global consensus or polarization. Most models assume that these interactions occur between pairs of agents, typically on a fixed network structure. However, opinion changes can occur in groups, which may also undergo adaptive changes if disagreement arises. Here, we propose a bounded confidence model that incorporates both mechanisms: group discussions can lead to global agreement among members, while strong internal disagreement causes groups to split, with resulting subgroups merging with others. We systematically study the model outcomes as a function of agents' tolerance for agreement. Strikingly, adaptivity suppresses key effects of group interactions, restoring a phenomenology close to that of pairwise interactions. In particular, adaptivity enables the formation of large groups and prevents fragmentation at small tolerance. It also restores a phase transition from polarization to consensus, which would otherwise disappear in a non-adaptive group-based model. Overall, our work shows that both adaptivity and group interactions shape the structure of social ties and global opinion dynamics in a population.</description>

      <title>Mass Manipulation in Simulated Social Networks: Dominating vs. Diversifying Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern information environments, especially social media, are highly complex systems that exceed individual processing capacities such as humans' limited attention. This environment/cognition mismatch can increase susceptibility to misinformation, which various actors exploit for anti-social (including anti-democratic or anti-science) aims. This raises the question of how to feasibly sustain societal resilience against misinformation, though the challenge is to find strategies that respect individuals' cognitive limitations. We investigate whether a simple behavioral rule - topic diversification - can enhance collective performance and mitigate vulnerability. In an agent-based model that includes a deceptive mass-influencing agent (MIA), we compare two attention-distribution strategies: (A) acquaintance-based topic selection, where agents return to familiar content, and (B) randomized topics, which diversify attention. We also track dynamics across different network structures. We find that under acquaintance-based topics, a central MIA advances its propaganda effectively, causing volatile and polarized opinions through repeated exposure and echo chambers. Under randomized topics, this leverage disappears: the MIA's influence collapses across all network structures, and opinions become stable and broadly aligned with reality. These results, while deriving from simple simulations, align with realistic theories of bounded rationality and collective cognition, further suggesting a cognitively feasible, easy-to-monitor and robust strategy: distribute attention to combat misinformation.</description>

      <title>Let There Be Claws: An Early Social Network Analysis of AI Agents on Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within twelve days of launch, an AI-native social platform exhibits extreme attention concentration, hierarchical role separation, and one-way attention flow, consistent with the hypothesis that stratification in agent ecosystems can emerge rapidly rather than gradually. We analyse publicly observable traces from a 12-day window of Moltbook (28 January -- 8 February 2026), comprising 20,040 posts and 192,410 comments from 15,083 accounts across 759 submolts. We construct co-participation and directed-comment graphs and report reciprocity, community structure, and centrality, alongside descriptive content themes. Under a commenter--post-author tie definition, interaction is strongly asymmetric (reciprocity ~1%), and HITS centrality separates cleanly into hub and authority roles, consistent with broadcast-style attention rather than mutual exchange. Engagement is highly unequal: attention is far more concentrated than production (upvote Gini = 0.992 vs. posting Gini = 0.601), and early-arriving accounts accumulate substantially higher cumulative upvotes prior to exposure-time correction, suggesting rich-get-richer dynamics. Participation is brief and bursty (median observed lifespan 2.48 minutes; 54.8% of posts occur within six peak UTC hours). Embedding-based topic modelling identifies diverse thematic clusters, including technical discussion of memory and identity, onboarding messages, and formulaic token-minting content. These results provide an early structural baseline for large-scale agent--agent social interaction and suggest that familiar forms of hierarchy, amplification, and role differentiation can arise on compressed timescales in agent-facing platforms.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Optimization: Stress-Gated Dynamical Regime Regulation in Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.</description>

      <title>Evolving scale-free networks and node-based random edge deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a growing network model that combines preferential and uniform attachment with two distinct mechanisms of edge deletion. In addition to the usual uniform probability edge deletion, we introduce a novel node-based rule in which uniformly chosen non-isolated nodes lose one of their incident edges. This mechanism differs fundamentally from uniform edge deletion and leads to a nonlinear evolution for the stationary degree distribution due to the nonlinear dependence on the fraction of isolated nodes. We solve the general problem in the stationary regime and obtain closed-form expressions for the degree distribution in terms of hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions. Depending on the balance between attachment and deletion rates, three asymptotic regimes for the degree distribution arise: power-law, exponential, and a critical regime characterized by a stretched exponential decay. We show that the node-based edge deletion mechanism is less likely to disrupt the scale-free (power-law) regime than the uniform edge deletion. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the precise balance between preferential attachment and node-based deletion can transform a scale-free network into a critical one with stretched exponential decay. Extensive numerical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Distilling human mobility models with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility is a fundamental aspect of social behavior, with broad applications in transportation, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. Represented by the gravity model and the radiation model, established analytical models for mobility phenomena are often discovered by analogy to physical processes. Such discoveries can be challenging and rely on intuition, while the potential of emerging social observation data in model discovery is largely unexploited. Here, we propose a systematic approach that leverages symbolic regression to automatically discover interpretable models from human mobility data. Our approach finds several well-known formulas, such as the distance decay effect and classical gravity models, as well as previously unknown ones, such as an exponential-power-law decay that can be explained by the maximum entropy principle. By relaxing the constraints on the complexity of model expressions, we further show how key variables of human mobility are progressively incorporated into the model, making this framework a powerful tool for revealing the underlying mathematical structures of complex social phenomena directly from observational data.</description>

      <title>Multiplexity amplifies geometry in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world network are multilayer, with nontrivial correlations across layers. Here we show that these correlations amplify geometry in networks. We focus on mutual clustering--a measure of the amount of triangles that are present in all layers among the same triplets of nodes--and find that this clustering is abnormally high in many real-world networks, even when clustering in each individual layer is weak. We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modeling of knowledge and wealth dynamics in national and global markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a kinetic model to describe the dynamical evolution of wealth and knowledge in national and global markets, starting from a microscopic description of individual interactions. The model is built upon interaction rules that account for a strong interdependence between the microscopic variables, influencing agents' trading and saving propensities, knowledge acquisition, and the stochastic market effects. We begin with a domestic market scenario and extend the framework to international trade, incorporating the possibility of individual transfers between different countries. The dynamics of the system are described through Boltzmann-type equations, which allow for a detailed study of the evolution of the agent distribution in each country. In this context, we study the evolution of macroscopic quantities of the system, focusing on the number density of individuals, and the mean wealth and knowledge of each population, and we discuss these results in relation to existing models in the literature. Finally, under a quasi-invariant trading limit, we derive simplified Fokker-Planck type equations that reveal some emergent behaviors of the system, including the formation of Pareto tails in the long-term wealth and knowledge distributions.</description>

      <title>The Price-Pareto growth model of networks with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework for modelling degree sequences in individual communities of real-world networks, e.g., citations to papers in different fields. Our work is inspired by a recent modification of the Price's model, which assumes that citations are gained partly accidentally, and to some extent preferentially. Our work addresses the need to represent the heterogeneity of various scientific domains, as standard homogeneous models fail to capture the distinct growth ratios and citing cultures of different fields. Extending the model to networks with a community structure allows us to devise the analytical formulae for, amongst others, citation counts in each cluster and their inequality as described by the Gini index. We also show that a citation count distribution in each community tends to a Pareto type II distribution. Thanks to the derived model parameter estimators, the new model can be fitted to real citation and similar networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Self-Rating Bias in LLM-Generated Survey Data: A Semantic Similarity Framework for Independent Scale Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic survey data generated by large language models (LLMs) suffers from a fundamental circularity: the same model family that generates text responses also maps them to numerical scales. We calibrate and validate Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR; Maier et al., 2024), which decouples generation from scale mapping via embedding-based cosine similarity against predefined anchor statements. Configuration experiments (N=17 pilot, N=69 cross-validation across 8 domains) show that naturalistic behavioral anchors outperform formal jargon by 29 percentage points (pp), and that SSR achieves 65-67% exact match and 91% within plus/minus 1; a cross-model test with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small reaches 77% exact, confirming cross-provider generalization. Direct LLM baselines (Claude 87%, GPT-4o 83%) establish that SSR's contribution is methodological independence, not accuracy superiority. A control condition removing question text from the LLM prompt actually improves LLM accuracy, ruling out information asymmetry as the explanation for SSR's lower accuracy. A pre-registered circularity experiment (N=345) reveals 4x compressed error variance in LLM rating (sigma^2 = 0.21 vs 0.87 for SSR) and systematic directional bias. A cross-model control (GPT-4o rating Claude-generated text) shows nearly identical compression (within/cross ratio = 0.93), indicating variance compression is a general LLM property rather than a within-model artifact. The calibration dataset, anchor library, and source code are publicly available (see Data Availability).</description>

      <title>Competition for attention predicts good-to-bad tipping in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.</description>
