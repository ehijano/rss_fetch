      <title>On the Range of a class of Complex Monge-Amp\`ere operators on compact Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold of complex dimension $n$. Let $\beta$ be a smooth real closed $(1,1)$ form such that there exists a function $\rho \in \mbox{PSH}(X,\beta)\cap L^{\infty}(X)$. We study the range of the complex non-pluripolar Monge-Amp\`ere operator $\langle(\beta+dd^c\cdot)^n\rangle$ on weighted Monge-Amp\`ere energy classes on $X$. In particular, when $\rho$ is assumed to be continuous, we give a complete characterization of the range of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator on the class $\mathcal E(X,\beta)$, which is the class of all $\varphi \in \mbox{PSH}(X,\beta)$ with full Monge-Amp\`ere mass, i.e. $\int_X\langle (\beta+dd^c\varphi)^n\rangle=\int_X\beta^n$.</description>

      <title>On monogenic functions and the Dirac complex of two vector variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monogenic function of two vector variables is a function annihilated by the operator consisting of two Dirac operators, which are associated to two variables, respectively. We give the explicit form of differential operators in the Dirac complex resolving this operator and prove its ellipticity directly. This open the door to apply the method of several complex variables to investigate this kind of monogenic functions. We prove the Poincar\'e lemma for this complex, i.e. the non-homogeneous equations are solvable under the compatibility condition by solving the associated Hodge Laplacian equations of fourth order. As corollaries, we establish the Bochner--Martinelli integral representation formula for this differential operator and the Hartogs' extension phenomenon for monogenic functions. We also apply abstract duality theorem to the Dirac complex to obtain the generalization of Malgrange's vanishing theorem and establish the Hartogs--Bochner extension phenomenon for monogenic functions under the moment condition.</description>

      <title>Resolving Gilbert's Conjecture: Dimensional Dependencies in Hardy Spaces Valued in Clifford Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a thorough investigation into Gilbert's Conjecture, pertaining to Hardy spaces in the upper half-space valued in Clifford modules. We explore the conjecture proposed by Gilbert in 1991, which seeks to extend the classical principle of representing real $L^p$ functions on the real line as boundary values of Hardy holomorphic functions to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces valued in any Clifford module. We present a complete resolution to this conjecture, demonstrating that its validity is contingent upon the dimension $n$, specifically holding true when \(n \not\equiv 6, 7 \mod 8\) and failing otherwise. The pivotal discovery that Gilbert's conjecture can be reformulated as a set of algebraic conditions is underscored in this work. To navigate these conditions, we employ a novel strategy that leverages the octonions, revealing their instrumental role in addressing issues related to Clifford modules and spinors. This innovative approach not only provides explicit realization through the generalization of the Hilbert transform to the Riesz transform but also establishes a significant advancement in the understanding of Hardy spaces within higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Witt basis over the tensor product of Clifford algebras and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate how the Witt basis serves as a link between real and complex variables in higher-dimensional spaces. Our focus is on the detailed construction of the Witt basis within the tensor product space combining Clifford algebra and multiple octonionic spaces. This construction effectively introduces complex coordinates. The technique is based on a specific subgroup of octonionic automorphisms, distinguished by binary codes. This method allows us to perform a Hermitian analysis of the complex structures within the tensor product space.</description>

      <title>On algebras of Dirichlet series invariant under permutations of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr O_u$ be the algebra of holomorphic functions on ${\bf C}_+:=\{s\in{\bf C}:\text{Re }s&gt;0\}$ that are limits of Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, $s\in \bf{C}_+$, that converge uniformly on proper half-planes of $\bf{C}_+$. We study algebraic-topological properties of subalgebras of $\mathscr O_u$: the Banach algebras $\mathscr W, \mathscr A, \mathscr H^\infty$ and the Frechet algebra $\mathscr O_b$. Here $\mathscr W$ consists of functions in $\mathscr O_u$ of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series on the closure of $\bf{C}_+$, $\mathscr A$ is the uniform closure of $\mathscr W$, $\mathscr H^\infty$ is the algebra of all bounded functions in $\mathscr O_u$, and $\mathscr O_b$ is set of all $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$ in $\mathscr O_u$ so that $f_r\in \mathscr H^\infty$, $r\in (0,1)$, where $f_r(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n r^{\Omega(n)} n^{-s}$ and $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$. Let $S_\bf{N}$ be the group of permutations of $\bf{N}$. Each $\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ determines a permutation $\hat\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ (i.e., such that $\hat\sigma(mn)=\hat\sigma(n)\hat\sigma(m)$ for all $m,n\in \bf{N}$) via the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For a Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, and $\sigma \in S_\bf{N}$, $S_\sigma(D)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\hat{\sigma}^{-1}(n)} n^{-s}$ determines an action of $S_\bf{N}$ on the set of all Dirichlet series. It is shown that each of the algebras above is invariant with respect to this action. Given a subgroup $G$ of $S_\bf{N}$, the set of $G$-invariant subalgebras of these algebras are studied, and their maximal ideal spaces are described, and used to characterise groups of units and of invertible elements having logarithms, find the stable rank, show projective freeness, and describe when the special linear group is generated by elementary matrices, with bounds on the number of factors.</description>

      <title>Completeness of systems of inner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{Q}$ denote the class of inner functions $\vartheta$ such that the measure $\sum_{w\in\vartheta^{-1}(z)} (1-|w|)\delta_w$ is a Carleson measure for all $z$ in the complement of a set of logarithmic capacity zero. For $\vartheta,\varphi\in\mathcal{Q}$, we give a simple sufficient condition for the system $\vartheta^m,\; \varphi^n$, $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$, to be complete in the weak-$^*$ topology of $L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$. To be precise, we show that this system is complete whenever there is an arc $I$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ such that $\vartheta$ is univalent on $I$ and $\varphi$ is univalent on $\mathbb{T}\setminus I$. As an application of this result, we describe a class of analytic curves $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, \mathcal{X})$ is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the lattice cross $\{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2:\, mn=0\}$. Our main result extends a theorem of Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez for atomic inner functions with one singularity.</description>

      <title>Oka-1 manifolds: New examples and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Oka-1 manifolds and Oka-1 maps, a class of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps recently introduced by Alarc\'on and Forstneri\v{c}. Oka-1 manifolds are characterised by the property that holomorphic maps from any open Riemann surface to the manifold satisfy the Runge approximation and Weierstrass interpolation conditions, while Oka-1 maps enjoy similar properties for liftings of maps from open Riemann surfaces in the absence of topological obstructions. We also formulate and study the algebraic version of the Oka-1 condition, called aOka-1. We show that it is a birational invariant for projective manifolds and holds for all uniformly rational projective manifolds. This gives a Runge approximation theorem for maps from compact Riemann surfaces to uniformly rational projective manifolds. Finally, we study a class of complex manifolds with an approximation property for holomorphic sprays of discs. This class lies between the smaller class of Oka manifolds and the bigger class of Oka-1 manifolds and has interesting functorial properties.</description>

      <title>The Beurling-Wintner problem for characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns a long-standing problem raised by Beurling and Wintner on completeness of the dilation system $\{\varphi(kx):k=1,2,\cdots\}$ generated by the odd periodic extension on $\mathbb{R}$ of any $\varphi\in L^2[0,1]$. Up to now there has been no explicit description of solutions of the Beurling-Wintner problem even for characteristic functions. We focus on characteristic function $\mathbf{1}_V$ of an open subset $V$ of $(0,1)$ where $V$ is the union of finitely many intervals with rational endpoints. Using substantially techniques from analytic number theory, we fully solved the Beurling-Wintner problem in most interesting situations and exhibit the explicit form of such $V$. As a consequence, it yields a complete solution for the rational version of Kozlov's problem. Moreover, we find that the Beurling-Wintner problem is closely related to the Twin Prime Conjecture and the Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Real chaos and complex time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real vector fields $\dot{z} = f(z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ extend to $\mathbb{C}^N$, for complex entire $f$. One known consequence are exponentially small upper bounds \begin{equation*} \label{*} C_\eta \exp(-\eta/\varepsilon) \tag{*} \end{equation*} on homoclinic splittings under discretizations of step size $\varepsilon&gt;0$, or under rapid forcings of that period. Here the complex time extension of $\Gamma(t)$ is assumed to be analytic in the complex horizontal strip $|\mathrm{Im}\, t|\leq \eta$. The phenomenon relates to adiabatic elimination, infinite order averaging, invisible chaos, and backward error analysis.
  However, what if $\Gamma(t)$ itself were complex entire? Then $\eta$ could be chosen arbitrarily large. We consider connecting orbits $\Gamma(t)$ between limiting hyperbolic equilibria $f(v_\pm)=0$, for real $t\rightarrow\pm\infty$. For the linearizations $f'(v_\pm)$, we assume real eigenvalues which are nonresonant, separately at $v_\pm$. We then show the existence of singularities of $\Gamma(t)$ in complex time $t$. In that sense, real connecting orbits are accompanied by finite time blow-up, in imaginary time. Moreover, the singularities bound admissible $\eta$ in exponential estimates \eqref{*}.
  The cases of complex or resonant eigenvalues are completely open. We therefore offer a 1,000 Euro reward to any mathematician, up to and including non-permanent PostDoc level, who first comes up with a complex entire homoclinic orbit $\Gamma(t)$, in the above setting. Such an example would exhibit ultra-exponentially small separatrix splittings, and ultra-invisible chaos, under discretization.
  We also provide a time-reversible example of an entire periodic orbit with ultra-sharp Arnold tongues, alias ultra-invisible phaselocking, under discretization.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical asymptotics for Bergman projections with Gevrey weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the direct approach to the semiclassical asymptotics for Bergman projections, developed by Deleporte--Hitrik--Sj\"ostrand for real analytic exponential weights and Hitrik--Stone for smooth exponential weights, to the case of Gevrey weights. We prove that the amplitude of the asymptotic Bergman projection forms a Gevrey symbol whose asymptotic coefficients obey certain Gevrey-type growth rate, and it is constructed by an asymptotic inversion of an explicit Fourier integral operator up to a Gevrey-type small remainder.</description>
