      <title>Modeling information acquisition via f-divergence and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new cost function over experiments, f-information, based on the theory of multivariate statistical divergences, that generalizes Sims's classic model of rational inattention as well as the class of posterior-separable cost functions. We characterize its behavioral predictions by deriving optimality conditions that extend those of Matejka and McKay (2015) and Caplin, Dean, and Leahy (2019) beyond mutual information. Using these tools, we study the implications of f-information in a number of canonical decision problems. A strength of the framework is that it can be analyzed using familiar methods of microeconomics: convex duality and the Arrow-Pratt approach to expected utility.</description>

      <title>An analysis of government subsidy policies in vaccine supply chain: Innovation, Production, or Consumption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccines play a crucial role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. However, the vaccine supply chain faces numerous challenges that hinder its efficiency. To address these challenges and enhance public health outcomes, many governments provide subsidies to support the vaccine supply chain. This study analyzes a government-subsidized, three-tier vaccine supply chain within a continuous-time differential game framework. The model incorporates dynamic system equations that account for both vaccine quality and manufacturer goodwill. The research explores the effectiveness and characteristics of different government subsidy strategies, considering factors such as price sensitivity, and provides actionable managerial insights. Key findings from the analysis and numerical simulations include the following: First, from a long-term perspective, proportional subsidies for technological investments emerge as a more strategic approach, in contrast to the short-term focus of volume-based subsidies. Second, when the public is highly sensitive to vaccine prices and individual vaccination benefits closely align with government objectives, a volume-based subsidy policy becomes preferable. Finally, the integration of blockchain technology positively impacts the vaccine supply chain, particularly by improving vaccine quality and enhancing the profitability of manufacturers in the later stages of production.</description>

      <title>Traffic jams and driver behavior archetypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion represents a complex urban phenomenon that has been the subject of extensive research employing various modeling techniques grounded in the principles of physics and molecular theory. Although factors such as road design, accidents, weather conditions, and construction activities contribute to traffic congestion, driver behavior and decision-making are primary determinants of traffic flow efficiency. This study introduces a driver behavior archetype model that quantifies the relationship between individual driver behavior and system-level traffic outcomes through game-theoretic modeling and simulation (N = 500,000) of a three-lane roadway. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed statistically significant differences across all utility measures (p &lt; .001, d &gt; 2.0). In homogeneous populations, responsible drivers achieved substantially higher expected utility (M = -0.090) than irresponsible drivers (M = -1.470). However, in mixed environments (50/50), irresponsible drivers paradoxically outperformed responsible drivers (M = 0.128 vs. M = -0.127), illustrating a social dilemma wherein defection exploits cooperation. Pairwise comparisons across the six driver archetypes indicated that all irresponsible types achieved equivalent utilities while consistently surpassing responsible drivers. Lane-specific analyses revealed differential capacity patterns, with lane 1 exhibiting a more pronounced cumulative utility decline. These findings offer a robust framework for traffic management interventions, congestion prediction, and policy design that aligns individual incentives with collective efficiency. Directions for future research were also proposed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Softmax: A New Perspective on Gradient Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between a class of discrete choice models and the theory of online learning and multi-armed bandits. Our contributions are: (i) sublinear regret bounds for a broad algorithmic family, encompassing Exp3 as a special case; (ii) a new class of adversarial bandit algorithms derived from generalized nested logit models \citep{wen:2001}; and (iii) \textcolor{black}{we introduce a novel class of generalized gradient bandit algorithms that extends beyond the widely used softmax formulation. By relaxing the restrictive independence assumptions inherent in softmax, our framework accommodates correlated learning dynamics across actions, thereby broadening the applicability of gradient bandit methods.} Overall, the proposed algorithms combine flexible model specification with computational efficiency via closed-form sampling probabilities. Numerical experiments in stochastic bandit settings demonstrate their practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Repeated Matching: A Maximin Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making model where a set of items is repeatedly matched to the same set of agents over multiple rounds. The objective is to determine a sequence of matchings that either maximizes the utility of the least advantaged agent at the end of all rounds (optimal) or at the end of every individual round (anytime optimal). We investigate the computational challenges associated with finding (anytime) optimal outcomes and demonstrate that these problems are generally computationally intractable. However, we provide approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and identify several special cases whereby the problem(s) can be solved efficiently. Along the way, we also establish characterizations of Pareto-optimal/maximum matchings, which may be of independent interest to works in matching theory and house allocation.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Origin of the Probability Weighting Function in Human Representation of Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the representation of probability in the human mind has been of great interest to understanding human decision making. Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.</description>

      <title>Random Utility with Unobservable Alternatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random utility model, a cornerstone in economics, is axiomatized by Falmagne (1978) and McFadden and Richter (1990) with the assumption that if a menu is observable, the choice frequencies of all alternatives are also observable. However, in practice, it is common for choice frequencies of some alternatives to remain unobserved. To address this discrepancy, we obtain the testable implications of the random utility model when the choice frequencies of some alternatives are unobservable, which consist of nonredundant inequality constraints on observed choice frequencies. Our findings indicate that the widespread empirical practice of aggregating unobserved alternatives into a single "outside option" fails to capture significant implications of random utility models.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Cycle: A "Dynamic" Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel equilibrium concept, called the equilibrium cycle, which seeks to capture the outcome of oscillatory game dynamics. Unlike the (pure) Nash equilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, an equilibrium cycle is a set-valued solution concept that can be demonstrated even in games where best responses do not exist (for example, in discontinuous games). The equilibrium cycle identifies a Cartesian product set of action profiles that satisfies three important properties: stability against external deviations, instability against internal deviations, and minimality. This set-valued equilibrium concept generalizes the classical notion of the minimal curb set to discontinuous games. In finite games, the equilibrium cycle is related to strongly connected sink components of the best response graph.</description>

      <title>Random Utility with Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize when discrete-choice datasets that involve aggregation, such as category-level items or an outside option, are consistent with a random utility model (RUM). The underlying alternatives that an aggregated category represents may differ across individuals and remain unobserved by the analyst. We characterize the observable implications of RUMs with unknown composition of aggregated categories and show that they are surprisingly weak, implying only limited monotonicity of choice frequencies and standard RUM consistency on unaggregated menus. These restrictions are insufficient to justify the aggregated random utility model (ARUM) commonly assumed in empirical work. We identify two sufficient conditions that restore the implication of ARUM: non-overlapping preferences and menu-independent aggregation. Simulations show that violations of these conditions generate estimation bias, highlighting the practical importance of how data are aggregated.</description>

      <title>Public Persuasion with Endogenous Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study public persuasion when a sender communicates with a large audience that can fact-check at heterogeneous costs. The sender commits to a public information policy before the state is realized, but any verifiable claim she makes after observing the state must be truthful (an ex-post implementability constraint). Receivers observe the public message and then decide whether to verify; this selective verification feeds back into the sender's objective and turns the design problem into a constrained version of Bayesian persuasion. Our main result is a reverse comparative static: when fact-checking becomes cheaper in the population, the sender optimally supplies a strictly less informative public signal. Intuitively, cheaper verification makes bold claims invite scrutiny, so the sender coarsens information to dampen the incentive to verify. We also endogenize two ex-post instruments - continuous falsification and fixed-cost repression - and characterize threshold substitutions from persuasion to manipulation and, ultimately, to repression as monitoring improves. The framework provides testable predictions for how transparency, manipulation, and repression co-move with changes in verification technology.</description>

      <title>Strategic Pricing and Ranking in Recommendation Systems with Seller Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a recommendation system where sellers compete for visibility by strategically offering commissions to a platform that optimally curates a ranked menu of items and their respective prices for each customer. Customers interact sequentially with the menu following a cascade click model, and their purchase decisions are influenced by price sensitivity and positions of various items in the menu. We model the seller-platform interaction as a Stackelberg game with sellers as leaders and consider two different games depending on whether the prices are set by the platform or prefixed by the sellers. It is complicated to find the optimal policy of the platform in complete generality; hence, we solve the problem in an important asymptotic regime.
  The core contribution of this paper lies in characterizing the equilibrium structure of the limit game. We show that when sellers are of different strengths, the standard Nash equilibrium does not exist due to discontinuities in utilities. We instead establish the existence of a novel equilibrium solution, namely `$\mu$-connected equilibrium cycle' ($\mu$-EC), which captures oscillatory strategic responses at the equilibrium. Unlike the (pure) Nash equilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, this is a set-valued solution concept of connected components. This novel equilibrium concept identifies a Cartesian product set of connected action profiles in the continuous action space that satisfies four important properties: stability against external deviations, no external chains, instability against internal deviations, and minimality. We extend a recently introduced solution concept equilibrium cycle to include stability against measure-zero violations and, by avoiding topological difficulties to propose $\mu$-EC.</description>

      <title>Modelling Asset Price Dynamics with Investor Inertia: Diffusion with Advection and Fourth-Order Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard models of asset price dynamics, such as geometric Brownian motion (see, for example, Osborne, 1959, Samuelson, 2016), do not formally incorporate investor inertia. This paper presents a two-stage framework for modelling this behaviour. First, we establish a microfoundation for the classic diffusion-with-advection model by representing the asset's log price as a three-state random walk (up, down or neutral). While this derivation offers a clear behavioural origin for drift and volatility, it is ultimately limited by its Gaussian nature and fails to capture the heavy tails (leptokurtosis) observed in financial markets. To address this issue, we introduce and apply a fourth-order extension inspired by diffusion-with-retention models (Bevilacqua, 2011), where a more complex representation of inertia generates non-Gaussian dynamics. Through an empirical application using Brazilian PETR4.SA data, we demonstrate that this extended model significantly outperforms the original in fitting the real distribution of returns. Our findings suggest that investor inertia is a dual concept capable of explaining both standard market trends and extreme events.</description>
