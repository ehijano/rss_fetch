      <title>Singular-degenerate parabolic systems with the conormal boundary condition on the upper half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the well-posedness and regularity of solutions in mixed-norm weighted Sobolev spaces for a class of second-order parabolic and elliptic systems in divergence form in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d_+ = \{x_d &gt; 0\}$ subject to the conormal boundary condition. Our work extends results previously available for scalar equations to the case of systems of equations. The leading coefficients are the product of $x_d^{\alpha}$ and bounded non-degenerate matrices, where $\alpha \in (-1,\infty)$. The leading coefficients are assumed to be merely measurable in the $x_d$ variable, and to have small mean oscillations in small cylinders with respect to the other variables. Our results hold for systems with lower-order terms that may blow-up near the boundary.</description>

      <title>Fractional Morrey-Sobolev type embeddings and nonlocal subelliptic problems with oscillating nonlinearities on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the fractional Morrey-Sobolev type embeddings on stratified Lie groups. This extends and complements the Sobolev type embeddings derived in \cite{GKR}. As an application of the results, we study the following nonlocal subelliptic problem, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} (-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s u= \lambda \beta(x) g(u) &amp; \text{in} \quad \Omega, \\ u=0\quad &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ with $ps\geq Q$, $Q$ is the homogeneous dimension of the stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$, $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s$ is the fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian on $\mathbb{G},$ $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{G}$, $ \lambda$ is a positive real parameter, $\beta \in L^\infty(\Omega, \R_{&gt;0})$ and $g \in C(\mathbb{R}, \R) $ oscillates near the origin or at infinity. By using the variational principle of Ricceri, we prove the existence and asymptotic behaviors of infinitely many solutions to the problem under consideration. We emphasize that the results obtained here are also novel for $\mathbb{G}$ being the Heisenberg group and $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary norm growth in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of smooth initial data for the Navier-Stokes equations, bounded in $BMO^{-1}(\mathbb T^3)$, that gives rise to arbitrarily large global solutions. As a consequence, we rule out various hypothetical a priori estimates for strong solutions in terms of a critical norm of the initial data. To our knowledge, this is the first example of unbounded norm growth in the well-posed setting. The solutions exhibit an inverse cascade across an unbounded number of modes, with growth resulting from repeated squaring by the quadratic nonlinearity. This mechanism relies on largeness of the data in $B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$ and is fundamentally distinct from instantaneous norm inflation and ill-posedness phenomena.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Electron MHD with random diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) equations in the absence of resistivity, a regime that is generally ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the system's quasilinear structure. Motivated by the recent work of one of the authors on the inviscid primitive equations (R.~Hu, Q.~Lin, and R.~Liu, \emph{Journal of Nonlinear Science}, 35:84, 2025), we introduce a random diffusion term and demonstrate that it restores local well-posedness almost surely in appropriate Gevrey classes. Furthermore, under slightly stronger diffusion and small initial data, we establish global well-posedness with high probability. These results extend the scope of stochastic regularization techniques to a broader class of quasilinear magnetic systems relevant to plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Global Existence of Solutions for A Class of Nonlocal Reaction-Diffusion Systems and Their Diffusive Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the global existence of solutions for a class of semilinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems with $m$ components on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. The initial data is assumed to be component-wise nonnegative and bounded, and the reaction vector field associated with the system is assumed to be quasi-positive and satisfy a generalized mass control condition. We obtain global existence and uniqueness of component-wise nonnegative solutions. With the additional assumption that the reaction vector field satisfies a linear intermediate sums condition, we employ an $L^p$ energy type functional to establish the uniform boundedness of solutions in $L^p(\Omega)$ for all $2 \le p&lt;\infty$ independent of the nonlocal diffusion operator for our system in $L^p$ space for $2 \le p &lt; \infty$. This allows us to generalize a recent diffusive limit result of Laurencot and Walker \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal}. We, also analyze a class of $m$ component reaction-diffusion systems in which some of the components diffuse nonlocally and the other components diffuse locally, where the latter components satisfy homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under various assumptions, we establish global existence and uniqueness of componentwise nonnegative solutions by using duality arguments. Finally, we numerically verify our diffusive limit result. We also numerically solve the reaction-diffusion systems with a mixture of nonlocal and local diffusion and show the visual difference of its solutions with the system in which all components diffuse nonlocally.</description>

      <title>Global bounded solutions of the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via Couette flow and logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well-known, the solutions to the Patlak-Keller-Segel system in 3D may blow up in finite time regardless of any initial cell mass. In this paper, we investigate the existence of global bounded solutions of the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with a large initial cell mass via Couette flow or logistic source in a finite channel. On the one hand, it is proved that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial velocity is small, the bounded solutions of the system are global in time without any limitation on the initial mass $M$ if the logistic source term exists. On the other hand, if the logistic source term vanishes, it is proved that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial velocity is small, the solutions with a finite initial mass $M$, whose lower bound is $ \left(\frac{8\pi}{9}\right)^-$, are global in time.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded domains. Part II: Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study well-posedness of degenerate mixed-type parabolic-hyperbolic equations $$ \partial_tu+\textrm{div}\big(f(u)\big)=\mathcal{L}[b(u)] $$ on bounded domains with general Dirichlet boundary/exterior conditions. The nonlocal diffusion operator $\mathcal{L}$ is a symmetric L{\'e}vy operator (e.g. fractional Laplacians) and $b$ is nondecreasing and allowed to have degenerate regions ($b'=0$). In [N. Alibaud, J. Endal, E. R. Jakobsen, and O. M{\ae}hlen. Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded domains. \emph{Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Anal. Non Lineaire}, 2025. Published online first, DOI 10.4171/AIHPC/153], we introduced an entropy solution formulation for the problem and showed uniqueness of bounded entropy solutions under general assumptions. In this paper we complete the program by proving existence of such solutions. Starting from known results for scalar conservations laws, existence is proved first for bounded/zero order operators $\mathcal{L}$ by a fixed point argument, and then extended in steps to more general operators via approximations of $\mathcal{L}$. Lack of strong compactness of approximate solutions $u_n$ is overcome through nonlinear weak-$\star$ compactness and entropy-process solutions. Key ingredients are stability results for our formulation and \textit{strong} compactness of the term $b(u)$, both with respect to variations in $\mathcal{L}$. Strong compactness follows from energy estimates and novel arguments for transferring weak regularity from $\partial_t u_n$ to $\partial_t b(u_n)$. Our work can be seen as both extending nonlocal theories from the whole space to domains and local theories on domains to the nonlocal case. Unlike local theories our formulation does not assume energy estimates. They are now a consequence of the formulation, but as opposed to previous nonlocal theories, they play an essential role in our arguments. Several results of independent interest are established, including a characterization of the L{\'e}vy operators $\mathcal{L}$ for which the corresponding energy/Sobolev-space compactly embeds into $L^2$.</description>

      <title>Least Energy Solutions for Cooperative and Competitive Schr\"odinger Systems with Neumann Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following gradient elliptic system with Neumann boundary conditions \begin{equation*} -\Delta u + \lambda_1 u = u^3 + \beta uv^2, \ -\Delta v + \lambda_2 v = v^3 + \beta u^2 v \ \text{in } \Omega,\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} = 0 \ \text{on } \partial \Omega, \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $ is a bounded $ C^2$ domain with $ N \leq 4 $, and $ \nu $ denotes the outward unit normal on the boundary. We investigate the existence of non-constant least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta &gt; 0 $) and the competitive ($ \beta &lt; 0 $) regimes, considering both the definite and the indefinite case, namely $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb R$. We emphasize that our analysis includes both the subcritical case $ N \leq 3 $ and the critical case $ N = 4 $.
  Depending on the values of $\beta,\lambda_1,\lambda_2$, the least energy solution is obtained either via a linking theorem, by minimizing over a suitable Nehari manifold, or by direct minimization on the set of all non-trivial weak solutions. Our results and techniques can be also adapted to cover some previously untreated cases for Dirichlet conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of blow-up solution of time-fractional heat equations is of significant and wide-ranging interest for its multitude of applications. These types of equations are used to model several real problems in science and engineering. This article is concerned with the blow-up solutions of a time fractional heat equation subject to nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions of power type. Firstly, the local global exitance of positive solutions and blows up in finite time are studied, under some restricted conditions . Secondly, the blow-up set is investgated showing that the blow up can only occur at a boundary point.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration and Model Assessment of Cell Migration Dynamics with Surrogate Model Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>A Hyperbolic Inverse Problem for lower order terms on a closed manifold with disjoint data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the unique recovery of time-independent lower order terms appearing in the symmetric first order perturbation of the Riemannian wave equation by sending and measuring waves in disjoint open sets of \textit{a priori} known closed Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that if the set where we capture the waves satisfies a geometric control condition as well as a certain local symmetry condition for the distance functions, then the aforementioned measurement is sufficient to recover the lower order terms up to the natural gauge. For instance, our result holds if the complement of the receiver set is contained in a simple Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to the Quantum Navier-Stokes system in the whole space with a confining external potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dissipative quantum fluid on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 1$) confined by an external harmonic potential. The dynamics of the quantum fluid is described by the Quantum Navier-Stokes (QNS) system which is a particular case of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg systems. The goal of this paper is to prove the existence of global weak solutions to the QNS system. To this end, we write the evolution equations with respect to a Gaussian reference measure and follow the general strategy of previous works. Nevertheless, several substantial modifications have to be done due to our choice of the reference measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19015v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the stability and large-time behavior for 3D magneto-micropolar equations with horizontal dissipation. The global well-posedness of the aforementioned system is established, with the initial data and its vertical derivatives required to be sufficiently small in $L^2$ space. Moreover, we obtain the optimal decay rates for the $H^1$-norm of the solution. The proofs of our main results rely on the special structure of the equations and anisotropic Sobolev-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Well posedness for multidimensional scalar conservation laws with discontinuous non-degenerate flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for scalar conservation laws with discontinuous, non-degenerate fluxes. Locally, the fluxes are piecewise smooth across interfaces described by a Heaviside-type discontinuity, with left and right states depending smoothly on both space and the solution variable. The interface is given by a smooth function, and the fluxes vanish at the boundary values of the admissible interval for the solution.
  In addition, we consider the more general case of heterogeneous flux functions with bounded variation in the spatial variable and smooth dependence on the solution variable, again vanishing at the prescribed boundary states. For this setting, we construct a stable semigroup of solutions, thereby establishing a well-posed solution framework.</description>

      <title>Elliptic systems generating a positive semigroup are decoupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the semigroup associated to a second-order elliptic system is positive if and only if the differential equations are essentially decoupled and the coefficients are real-valued. This means the system can be replaced by an equivalent decoupled system (which defines the same semigroup). Instead of matrix coefficients we more generally consider operator-valued coefficients, which leads to interesting additional difficulties with respect to Banach space valued integration.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (I): The De Giorgi conjecture for the local problem in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 &gt; 0 &gt; \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Singular jump processes as generalized gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the generalized gradient-flow framework of Peletier, Rossi, Savar\'e, and Tse to singular jump processes on abstract metric spaces, moving beyond the translation-invariant kernels considered in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$ in previous contributions. To address the analytical challenges posed by singularities, we introduce reflecting solutions, a new solution concept inspired by reflected Dirichlet forms, which ensures the validity of a chain rule and restores uniqueness. We establish existence, stability, and compactness results for these solutions by approximating singular kernels with regularized ones, and we show their robustness under such approximations. The framework encompasses dissipative and balanced solutions, clarifies their relations, and highlights the role of density properties of Lipschitz functions in upgrading weak formulations to reflecting solutions. As an application, we demonstrate the versatility of our theory to nonlocal stochastic evolutions on configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Least-energy solutions of the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem in the non-coercive case in dimension $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 3$ and $\lambda \ge 0$. We consider the celebrated Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem: \begin{equation}\label{eq:critlambda:abs} \tag{*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  -\Delta u -\lambda u &amp; =\left|u\right|^{2^*-2}u &amp;\hbox{ in } \Omega,
  u &amp; = 0 \quad \text{ in } \partial \Omega,
  \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation} where $2^* = \frac{2n}{n-2}$. When $n=3$ we investigate the existence of \emph{least-energy solutions} for this problem, that we define as having the lowest $L^{2^*}(\Omega)$ norm among all non-zero solutions. We prove that least-energy solutions of the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem exist when $\lambda$ belongs to a left neighbourhood of any eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ that we explicitly characterise by a positive mass assumption. We obtain in particular the first \emph{existence} result for the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on a general smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ when $n=3$ and $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$. In order to do this we introduce, for any $\lambda \ge 0$, a new variational problem inspired from spectral-theoretic considerations which is as follows: for any $u \in L^{2^*}(\Omega), u&gt;0$ a.e., we consider the principal eigenvalue of $- \Delta-\lambda$ on the weighted space $L^2(\Omega, u^{2^*-2} dx)$, whose value we then minimise over the set of normalised weights $\Vert u \Vert_{2^*} = 1$. When $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$ this defines a new, non-smooth variational problem for which we develop a variational theory. We prove that its minimisers exist under the aforementioned positive mass assumption and that they yield \emph{least-energy} solutions. We also obtain new results in the higher-dimensional case $n \ge 4$, where we show that the energy function of the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem is discontinuous exactly at the eigenvalues of $- \Delta$.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Sobolev and Rellich inequalities via iterated Talenti's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities on non-compact Riemannian manifolds supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We highlight two notable settings: manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and having Euclidean volume growth (supporting Brendle's isoperimetric inequality) and manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature (satisfying the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture or supporting Croke's isoperimetric inequality). Our proofs rely on various symmetrization techniques, the key ingredient is an iterated Talenti's comparison principle. The non-iterated version is analogous to the main result of Chen and Li [J. Geom. Anal., 2023].</description>

      <title>Spectral instability in the smooth Ponomarenko dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the kinematic dynamo equations for a passive vector in $\mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$ describing the evolution of a magnetic field with resistivity $\varepsilon&gt;0$, that is transported by a given velocity field. For a broad class of $C^3$ velocity fields with helical geometry, we establish the existence of solutions that exhibit exponential growth over time. We construct an unstable eigenmode via detailed resolvent estimates of the corresponding linear operator, which we carry out by introducing suitable Green's functions that accurately approximate the local behaviour of the true system. This approach yields an explicit asymptotic expression for the growing mode, providing a sharp description of the instability mechanism. We first derive the results with $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^2$ for a large class of velocity fields that includes finite energy examples. We then consider the case of domains with boundary, where $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{T}$ denotes a periodic cylinder, annular cylinder, or the exterior of a cylinder, with the boundary conditions of perfectly conducting walls. Our results offer a rigorous and sharp mathematical justification for the physically conjectured process by which helical flows can sustain magnetic field generation in the Ponomarenko dynamo, with growth rate of order $\varepsilon^{1/3}$.</description>

      <title>A mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed formulation of the classical Poisson problem introduces the flux as an additional variable, leading to a system of coupled equations. Using fractional calculus identities, in this work we explore a mixed formulation of the fractional Poisson problem and establish its well-posedness. Since a direct discretization of this problem appears to be out of reach, we adapt a stabilized approach by Hughes and Masud, which yields a coercive and well-posed formulation. The coercivity ensures the stability of any conforming finite element discretization. We further prove the convergence of this discretization, derive convergence rates, and discuss implementation aspects. Finally, we present numerical experiments that highlight both the importance of stabilization and the accuracy of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Minimal surface doublings and electrostatics for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twenty years ago, N. Kapouleas introduced a singular perturbation construction known as "doubling", which produces sequences of high-genus minimal surfaces converging to a given minimal surface with multiplicity two. Doubling constructions have since been implemented successfully in several settings, with deep work of Kapouleas-McGrath reducing their existence theory to the problem of finding suitable families of ansatz data on the initial minimal surface.
  In this paper, we introduce a variational approach to the existence of minimal doublings, relating the Kapouleas-McGrath construction to the study of nondegenerate critical points for a Coulomb-type interaction energy. By analyzing the minimizers of this energy, we prove that, in a generic closed 3-manifold, every two-sided, embedded minimal surface of index one admits a sequence of minimal doublings. As a corollary, we find that a generic 3-manifold contains an infinite sequence of embedded minimal surfaces with bounded area and arbitrarily large genus, whose geometry can be described with some precision.</description>

Abstract: Lieb has shown a lower bound on the smallest Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace operator in terms of a generalized inradius. We derive similar bounds for Robin eigenvalues, for eigenvalues of the polyharmonic operator and the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. We propose a method based on Hardy inequalities that is different from Lieb's approach.</description>

      <title>On existence of weak solutions to a Baer-Nunziato type system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a dissipative version of a compressible one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for a mixture of two compressible heat conducting gases is considered. The complete existence proof for weak solutions to this system was addressed as an open problem in [6, Section 5]. The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the "Navier-Stokes-Fourier" structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl--Lions approach for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. Eventually, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer--Nunziato system using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish precise lower bounds for the eigenvalues and critical values associated with the fractional $A-$Laplacian operator, where $A$ is a Young function. The obtained bounds are expressed in terms of the domain geometry and the growth properties of the function $A$. We emphasize that we do not assume that $A$ or its complementary function satisfies the $\Delta_2$ condition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.</description>

Abstract: Using the minimax technique from the critical point theory, which consists in constructing or transforming a suitable class of applications such that a critical value $c$ of a functional $f$ can be characterized as a minimax value over this class, we establish a new natural infinite-dimensional linking theorem for strongly indefinite functionals by using the $\tau-$topology of Kryszewski and Szulkin. Our result is a generalization of the classical linking theorem \cite[Theorem 2.21]{Wi}. As an application, we obtain the existence of a nontrivial solution to a system of coupled Poisson equations.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the evolution of two incompressible, immiscible fluids in two dimensions governed by the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations. We prove global-in-time well-posedness, establishing the preservation of the natural $C^{1+\gamma}$ H\"older regularity of the free boundary, for $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. This is the first result that allows for nonnegative density driven by a low-regularity initial velocity, while also remaining valid in the presence of a small viscosity jump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside arbitrary convex sets. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex set is larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, and we characterize the equality cases. This provides a complete solution to the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces outside convex sets at arbitrary contact angles, generalizing the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e inequality, which corresponds to the case $\theta=\frac\pi2$.</description>

Abstract: We study boundary regularity of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear degenerate or singular parabolic equations. The gradient-dependent degeneracy or singularity, along with the time derivative, introduces significant challenges beyond the elliptic case. By combining compactness methods, barrier constructions, regularization techniques, and the boundary regularity of small perturbation solutions, we establish boundary H\"older gradient estimates that unify and extend previous results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.</description>

      <title>Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.</description>

      <title>Half Space Property in RCD(K,N) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for RCD(0,N) spaces, namely that if (X,d,m) is a parabolic RCD(0,N) space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices.
  The same result is proved for RCD(K,N) spaces, for any $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in (1,\infty)$, under the stronger assumption that $C$ is the boundary of a \emph{globally} perimeter minimizing set.
  As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary), satisfying a Ricci curvature lower bound. On the way of proving the Half Space Property, we also extend to the RCD setting some classical results on Green's functions and parabolic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Initial data sets with vanishing mass are contained in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modeling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szeg\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ in $L^2$ norm for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, $s&gt;1$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales, thanks to the remarkable fact that the computational cost of the method is independent of the final time. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>
