      <title>Well-quasi-orders on embedded planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central theorem of topological graph theory states that the graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on graphs. It has far-reaching consequences, in particular in the study of graph structures and the design of (parameterized) algorithms. In this article, we study two embedded versions of classical minor relations from structural graph theory and prove that they are also well-quasi-orders on general or restricted classes of embedded planar graphs. These embedded minor relations appear naturally for intrinsically embedded objects, such as knot diagrams and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  Handling the extra topological constraints of the embeddings requires careful analysis and extensions of classical methods for the more constrained embedded minor relations. We prove that the embedded version of immersion induces a well-quasi-order on bounded carving-width plane graphs by exhibiting particularly well-structured tree-decompositions and leveraging a classical argument on well-quasi-orders on forests. We deduce that the embedded graph minor relation defines a well-quasi-order on plane graphs via their directed medial graphs, when their branch-width is bounded. We conclude that the embedded graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on all plane graphs, using classical grids theorems in the unbounded branch-width case.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Ordered Covering Problem in Distance Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ordered Covering Problem (OCP) arises in the context of the Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (DMDGP), where the ordering of pruning edges significantly impacts the performance of the SBBU algorithm for protein structure determination. In recent work, Souza et al. (2023) formalized OCP as a hypergraph covering problem with ordered, exponential costs, and proposed a greedy heuristic that outperforms the original SBBU ordering by orders of magnitude. However, the computational complexity of finding optimal solutions remained open. In this paper, we prove that OCP is NP-complete through a polynomial-time reduction from the strongly NP-complete 3-Partition problem. Our reduction constructs a tight budget that forces optimal solutions to correspond exactly to valid 3-partitions. This result establishes a computational barrier for optimal edge ordering and provides theoretical justification for the heuristic approaches currently used in practice.</description>

      <title>Robust Algorithms for Path and Cycle Problems in Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of robust subexponential algorithms for classical connectivity problems on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $\lambda$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\log^2 k)}\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $\lambda$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017]. This structural result may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Filtration-Based Representation Learning for Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a filtration on temporal graphs based on $\delta$-temporal motifs (recurrent subgraphs), yielding a multi-scale representation of temporal structure. Our temporal filtration allows tools developed for filtered static graphs, including persistent homology and recent graph filtration kernels, to be applied directly to temporal graph analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on temporal graph classification tasks.</description>
