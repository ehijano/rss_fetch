      <title>Symmetry groups and invariant solutions of plane Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium, traveling-wave, and periodic-orbit solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations provide a promising avenue for investigating the structure, dynamics, and statistics of transitional flows. Many such invariant solutions have been computed for wall-bounded shear flows, including plane Couette, plane Poiseuille, and pipe flow. However, the organization of invariant solutions is not well understood. In this paper we focus on the role of symmetries in the organization and computation of invariant solutions of plane Poiseuille flow. We show that enforcing symmetries while computing invariant solutions increases the efficiency of the numerical methods, and that redundancies between search spaces can be eliminated by consideration of equivalence relations between symmetry subgroups. We determine all symmetry subgroups of plane Poiseuille flow in a doubly-periodic domain up to translations by half the periodic lengths and classify the subgroups into equivalence classes, each of which represents a physically distinct set of symmetries and an associated set of physically distinct invariant solutions. We calculate fifteen new traveling waves of plane Poiseuille flow in seven distinct symmetry groups and discuss their relevance to the dynamics of transitional turbulence. We present a few examples of subgroups with fractional shifts other than half the periodic lengths and one traveling wave solution whose symmetry involves shifts by one-third of the periodic lengths. We conclude with a discussion and some open questions about the role of symmetry in the behavior of shear flows.</description>

      <title>Long-distance Liquid Transport Along Fibers Arising From Plateau-Rayleigh Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid mobility on fibers is critical to the effectiveness of fiber matrices in face masks, water harvesting and aerosol filtration, but is typically affected by Plateau-Rayleigh instability. However, the spontaneous flow within precursor films arising from this instability has been largely overlooked, particularly regarding its fundamental flow pattern and the potential for liquid mobilization. This study reveals the pivotal role of spontaneous flow on ribbon-like fibers in enhancing liquid transport. The non-axisymmetric curvature of these fibers induces long-wave instabilities, generating a sustained flow that enables film-wise transport over centimeter-scale distances at velocities of several millimeters per second. Using particle-image velocimetry, we uncover intricate hydrodynamics, including opposing flows within the film and organized vortices in the shear layer, driven by capillary effects at the liquid-vapor interfaces. Building on these insights, we demonstrate a network structure capable of achieving planar liquid transport over a 10 cm2 area. The ribbon-like fibers investigated exhibit the longest transport distances relative to biomimetic structures and aerodynamic propulsion. The unique transport dynamics and planar configuration of the fiber matrix offer substantial potential for advanced fiber-based liquid transport systems, with enhanced mass/heat transfer, laminar mixing and aerodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>A new complex fluid flow phenomenon: Bubbles-on-a-String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A liquid jet plunging into a quiescent bath of the same liquid is a fundamental fluid mechanical problem underpinning a range of processes in industry and the natural world. Significant attention has been given to the study of plunging laminar Newtonian jets and the associated air entrainment that can occur. However, there have been very few (if any) studies devoted to the equivalent case for non-Newtonian viscoelastic liquids. Here we consider the laminar plunging and associated air entrainment of a shear thinning viscoelastic jet into a still bath of the same liquid. We describe a previously unreported phenomenon, that we call ``bubbles-on-a-string'' (BUoaS), consisting of multiple stable toroidal bubbles rising co-axially around the submerged jet. In a qualitative sense, this new observation is akin to an inverse version of the well-known rheological phenomenon ``beads-on-a-string''. The BUoaS phenomenon is stable and repeatable and can be reproduced to a lesser extent in Newtonian surfactant solutions, indicating that low surface tension is key, but non-Newtonian rheology seems likely to provide the most favourable conditions for the onset of the phenomenon. A full characterisation and detailed study of this behaviour with accompanying numerical simulation is to follow in an upcoming publication.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse cascades scaling in real shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell models provide a simplified mathematical framework that captures essential features of incompressible fluid turbulence, such as the energy cascade and scaling of the fluid observables. We perform a precision analysis of the direct and inverse cascades in shell models of turbulence, where the velocity field is a real-valued function. We calculate the leading hundred anomalous scaling exponents, the marginal probability distribution functions of the velocity field at different shells, as well as the correlations between different shells. We find that the structure functions in both cascades exhibit a linear Kolomogorov scaling in the inertial range. We argue that the underlying reason for having no intermittency, is the strong correlations between the velocity fields at different shells. We analyze the tails of velocity distribution functions, which offer new insights to the structure of fluid turbulence.</description>

      <title>Additive-feature-attribution methods: a review on explainable artificial intelligence for fluid dynamics and heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of data-driven methods in fluid mechanics has surged dramatically in recent years due to their capacity to adapt to the complex and multi-scale nature of turbulent flows, as well as to detect patterns in large-scale simulations or experimental tests. In order to interpret the relationships generated in the models during the training process, numerical attributions need to be assigned to the input features. One important example are the additive-feature-attribution methods. These explainability methods link the input features with the model prediction, providing an interpretation based on a linear formulation of the models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP values) are formulated as the only possible interpretation that offers a unique solution for understanding the model. In this manuscript, the additive-feature-attribution methods are presented, showing four common implementations in the literature: kernel SHAP, tree SHAP, gradient SHAP, and deep SHAP. Then, the main applications of the additive-feature-attribution methods are introduced, dividing them into three main groups: turbulence modeling, fluid-mechanics fundamentals, and applied problems in fluid dynamics and heat transfer. This review shows thatexplainability techniques, and in particular additive-feature-attribution methods, are crucial for implementing interpretable and physics-compliant deep-learning models in the fluid-mechanics field.</description>

      <title>Clustering and chaotic motion of heavy inertial particles in an isolated non-axisymmetric vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of heavy inertial particles in a flow field due to an isolated, non-axisymmetric vortex. For our study, we consider a canonical elliptical vortex - the Kirchhoff vortex and its strained variant, the Kida vortex. Contrary to the anticipated centrifugal dispersion of inertial particles, which is typical in open vortical flows, we observe the clustering of particles around co-rotating attractors near the Kirchhoff vortex due to its non-axisymmetric nature. We analyze the inertia-modified stability characteristics of the fixed points, highlighting how some of the fixed points migrate in physical space, collide and then annihilate with increasing particle inertia. The introduction of external straining, the Kida vortex being an example, introduces chaotic tracer transport. Using a Melnikov analysis, we show that particle inertia and external straining can compete, where chaotic transport can be suppressed beyond a critical value of particle inertia.</description>

      <title>Theory of accelerated flows in a long wave approximation: High-order Shallow Water Equations (HSWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of coastal flows are characterized by turbulence, rendering the application of shallow water equations an inadequate approach for their accurate description. This paper presents a theory for characterizing accelerated coastal flows, offering an enhanced representation of turbulent flows in the long-wave approximation. The fundamental premise of the theory is as follows: Fluctuating velocities present in the water flow are found to correlate and generate additional motion (or fluctuating motion), which is associated with a velocity of the same order and regularity as the mean flow velocity. The resulting high-order long-wave model is both stable and efficient, comprising classical shallow water equations and additional equations that describe the transport of kinetic energy due to turbulence. The model's detailed eigenstructure and Rankine-Hugoniot relations, steady state solutions are presented in this paper. The proposed theory shows promise for addressing a variety of engineering problems, including roll waves, hydraulic jumps, dam breaks, and flooding. The derived model can accurately address the problem of the mixing layer interaction with a free surface and its transition into a turbulent surface jet. Recent application to sediment transport gives interesting results and good numerical convergences.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Non-Newtonian Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing a compelling derivation of Kolmogorov turbulence is a fascinating open challenge in field theory. Here, we pose a more modest question: if we had a field-theoretic description of Kolmogorov turbulence, could we use it to describe deviations caused, for example, by adding a polymer additive or by relativistic corrections? To investigate this issue, we assume a description of developed, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulence along the lines of Martin, Siggia, and Rose, and we work out the first corrections to the equal-time, two-point spectrum caused by adding non-Newtonian terms to the fluid stress tensor. While the results are not conclusive, they show a promising resemblance to turbulent spectra found in both experiments and large-scale numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulation of Particle Clustering and Turbulence Modulation: An Eulerian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new Eulerian framework for the computation of turbulent compressible multiphase channel flows, specifically to assess turbulence modulation by dispersed particulate matter. By combining a modified low-dissipation numerical scheme for the carrier flow and a quadrature moment-based method for the particle phase, the turbulent statistics of the carrier flow and the fluctuations of the particle phase may be obtained as both are resolved as coupled fields. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate how this method resolves the turbulent statistics, kinetic energy, and drag modulation for moderate Reynolds numbers channel flows for the first time. Validation of our approach to the turbulent clean flow proves the applicability of the carrier flow low dissipation scheme for relatively low Mach number compressible flows. This study also rationalizes the computed drag modulation results using a simplified analytical approach, revealing how the particle migration towards the wall can affect the drag between the two phases at different Stokes numbers and particle loadings. Using our Eulerian approach, we also show the complex interplay between the particles and flow turbulence fluctuations by capturing the preferential clustering of particles in the turbulence streaks. This interplay leads to turbulent flow modulations similar to recent observations reported in prior computational works using Lagrangian simulations. Our study extends the applicability of Eulerian approaches to accurately study particle-fluid interactions in compressible turbulent flows by explicitly calculating the energy equations for both the particle phase and the carrier fluid motion.</description>
