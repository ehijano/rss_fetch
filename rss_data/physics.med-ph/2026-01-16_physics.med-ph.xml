      <title>Radiation Shielding Performance of Different Concrete Materials: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Concrete is one of the most-used material today in nuclear, medical, and industrial applications for radiation shielding due to its economic advantages and availability together with its structural performance. However, differences in the use of aggregates, density, and other additives affect radiation attenuation efficiency. It is therefore necessary to understand and compare shielding properties of various concrete formulations for the optimization of safety and performance in radiation-prone environments. Methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search was performed across PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. 17 peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2025 were analysed systematically. Data was extracted based on material composition, density, radiation type, energy range, attenuation coefficients, and shielding efficiency. The obtained results were compared to find the trend in performance and optimization of the considered materials. Conclusion: Radiation shielding efficiency of concrete is dependent on its density, microstructural characteristics and type of aggregate. For superior performance in a mixed radiation field, Heavy and boron-rich additives can be added. Newly developed UHPCs and nano-engineered concretes are lightweight, durable, and environmentally friendly options for shielding materials compared to traditional ones. Further studies are needed to focus on the standardization of test methods, validation of long-term stability, and coupling computational modelling with experimental data in order to guide material design for applications featuring enhanced radiation shielding.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning of 3D Convolutional Foundation Models for ADHD Classification with Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children plays a crucial role in improving outcomes in education and mental health. Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.</description>
