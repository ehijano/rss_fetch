      <title>New Limits on Coherent Neutrino Nucleus Elastic Scattering Cross Section at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino nucleus elastic scattering ({\nu}Ael) with reactor neutrinos is an interaction under full quantum-mechanical coherence. It has not yet been experimentally observed. We present new results on the studies of {\nu}Ael cross section with an electro-cooled p-type point-contact germanium detector at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino laboratory. A total of (242)357 kg-days of Reactor ON(OFF) data at a detector threshold of 200 eVee in electron equivalent unit are analyzed. The Lindhard model parametrized by a single variable k which characterizes the quenching function was used. Limits at 90% confidence level are derived on the ratio {\rho} relative to standard model (SM) cross section of {\rho}&lt;4.7 at the predicted value of k=0.162, while k&lt;0.285 at the SM-value of {\rho}=1. Prospects on future positive measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards a new generation of solid total-energy detectors for neutron-capture time-of-flight experiments with intense neutron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Challenging neutron-capture cross-section measurements of small cross sections and samples with a very limited number of atoms require high-flux time-of-flight facilities. In turn, such facilities need innovative detection setups that are fast, have low sensitivity to neutrons, can quickly recover from the so-called $\gamma$-flash, and offer the highest possible detection sensitivity. In this paper, we present several steps toward such advanced systems. Specifically, we describe the performance of a high-sensitivity experimental setup at CERN n\_TOF EAR2. It consists of nine sTED detector modules in a compact cylindrical configuration, two conventional used large-volume C$_{6}$D$_{6}$ detectors, and one LaCl$_{3}$(Ce) detector. The performance of these detection systems is compared using $^{93}$Nb($n$,$\gamma$) data. We also developed a detailed \textsc{Geant4} Monte Carlo model of the experimental EAR2 setup, which allows for a better understanding of the detector features, including their efficiency determination. This Monte Carlo model has been used for further optimization, thus leading to a new conceptual design of a $\gamma$ detector array, STAR, based on a deuterated-stilbene crystal array. Finally, the suitability of deuterated-stilbene crystals for the future STAR array is investigaged experimentally utilizing a small stilbene-d12 prototype. The results suggest a similar or superior performance of STAR with respect to other setups based on liquid-scintillators, and allow for additional features such as neutron-gamma discrimination and a higher level of customization capability.</description>

      <title>Nuclear and Particle Physics through Quantum Sensing Using Cold Atoms and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As techniques for manipulating single atoms and molecules developed, quantum technologies witnessed drastic advancements. These technologies are now so mature that they can be applied to various fields. One of such fields is nuclear and particle physics, which were conventionally investigated with high energy accelerators. In general, quantum sensing enables high-precision measurements, opening ways to investigate high-energy phenomena that slightly modify energy levels of low-energy systems by higher-order perturbations. In other cases, such high-precision measurements are sensitive to faint low-energy interactions between the low-energy system and exotic fields. These measurements open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., variations of fundamental constants, dark matter, fifth force, parity violation, CP-violation, supersymmetric theories, and other physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, such measurements can serve as confirmations for existing results from completely different systems, or surpass existing results using smaller-scale experiments. The field of atomic and molecular physics oriented to nuclear and particle physics motivations evolved significantly. This paper provides an overview of the field of nuclear and particle physics through high-precision quantum measurements using atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of $\beta$-decay half-life predictions on Ge, As, Zr and Mo nuclei within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a parameter sensitivity analysis of the mapped interacting boson model (IBM) and boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM) description of $\beta$-decay properties of the neutron-rich even-even $^{96-110}$Zr and $^{98-110}$Mo nuclei, and neutron-deficient odd-odd $^{68,70}$As and even-even $^{78}$Ge nuclei. Based on the self-consistent mean-field calculations with a given energy density functional and a pairing interaction, strength parameters for the interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing even-even nuclei, single-particle energies and occupation probabilities for odd particles, which are needed to build the Gamow-Teller and Fermi transition operators as well as the IBFFM Hamiltonian, are completely determined. It is found that the calculated $\log{}_{10}ft$ values for the $\beta^+$ decay of $^{68}$As are particularly sensitive to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength for the even-even boson core of the odd-odd nucleus, $^{68}$As, as in the case of the neutron-rich Zr isotopes studied previously. We further incorporate higher-order terms in the one-nucleon transfer operators in the boson system, and find that while their effects are non-negligible, they do not significantly alter qualitative features of $\beta$-decay properties. We report a novel application of the mapped IBM framework to compute $\beta$-decay half-lives, and show that the observed trend along isotopic chains are reasonably reproduced.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative three-nucleon simulation using chiral lattice EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-nucleon system at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathrm{N^3LO}$) in the framework of chiral effective field theory (EFT) on the lattice. Our calculations do not rely on a perturbative treatment of subleading contributions to the nuclear forces. For the two-nucleon potential, we apply the previously developed $\mathrm{N^3LO}$ lattice interaction. For the leading contribution to the three-nucleon force, we determine the two low-energy constants (LECs) in the contact interactions by adjusting the ground state energy and half-life of triton, where the latter employs the nuclear axial current at $\mathrm{N^2LO}$ in chiral EFT. Additionally, the ground state energy of helion and the charge radii of the two considered nuclei are computed. No effect of the smearing regularization in the three-nucleon contact interaction is observed here. We compare our results with recent lattice-EFT calculations that are based on a potential tuned to light and medium-mass nuclei using the wave-function-matching technique to circumvent the Monte-Carlo sign problem.</description>

      <title>Observation of $t\bar{t}$ production in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels in $p$+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=8.16$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05078</link>

Abstract: This paper reports the observation of top-quark pair production in proton-lead collisions in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is performed using 165 nb$^{-1}$ of $p$+Pb data collected at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=8.16$ TeV in 2016. Events are categorised in two analysis channels, consisting of either events with exactly one lepton (electron or muon) and at least four jets, or events with two opposite-charge leptons and at least two jets. In both channels at least one $b$-tagged jet is also required. Top-quark pair production is observed with a significance over five standard deviations in each channel. The top-quark pair production cross-section is measured to be $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}= 58.1\pm 2.0\;\mathrm{(stat.)\;^{+4.8}_{-4.4} \;\mathrm{(syst.)}}\;\mathrm{nb}$, with a total uncertainty of 9%. In addition, the nuclear modification factor is measured to be $R_{p\mathrm{A}} = 1.090\pm0.039\;(\mathrm{stat.})\;^{+0.094}_{-0.087}\;(\mathrm{syst.})$. The measurements are found to be in good agreement with theory predictions involving nuclear parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Kaon production in the HADES experiment in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.4$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model by including the kaon reaction channels, we study the kaon prodution in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) at SIS (Darmstadt Schwerionen Synchrotron, GSI) energies. Based on simulations of a centrality of 0-40% Au + Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV, a typical reaction that has been carried out by the HADES Collaboration, we confirm that the medium modification of kaon masses plays a vital role in studying the kaon productions in HICs, and is also unavoidable for the successful interpretation of the HADES data on kaon rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra. Moreover, it is shown that the directed flows of kaons are affected significantly by the kaon potential and slightly affected by the medium modification of kaon masses. Also, the rapidity-dependent inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ of the kaon transverse mass spectra is shown to be affected considerably by both the kaon potential and medium modification of kaon masses. However, through checking the simulations of related reactions in FOPI and/or KaoS experiments, some of these regular effects do not seem to be obvious and appear to be the reaction system and/or beam energy dependent. Nevertheless, it can be confirmed that the medium modification of kaon masses is favored by observations from the inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ and transverse mass spectra of kaons in both HADES Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV and FOPI Ni + Ni collisions at 1.93\textit{A} GeV. Therefore, measurements of the inverse slope parameter $T_{B}$ of kaon transverse mass spectra and the kaon directed flows in HADES Au + Au collisions would be great benefit to detection of the kaon potential and the corresponding medium effects on kaon masses.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow fluctuation as a possible signature of clustered nuclear geometry in O-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclei having $4n$ number of nucleons are theorized to possess clusters of $\alpha$ particles ($^4$He nucleus). The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly magic nucleus, where the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure grants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic flow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear geometry with respect to a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD models. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular flow ($v_{3}$), as a function of multiplicity class. Anisotropic flow fluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are also studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_3$ for the low-multiplicity events. Consequently, a rise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the 0--10\% multiplicity class. Further, for $\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for the highest multiplicity events, which decrease as the final-state multiplicity decreases. In contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an opposite behavior with decreasing multiplicity. When confronted with experimental data, this study may reveal the importance of the nuclear density profile on the discussed observables and provide physics validation for the hybrid model discussed in this work.</description>
