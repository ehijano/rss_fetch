      <title>LAAG-RV: LLM Assisted Assertion Generation for RTL Design Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) is an important but complex step in verifying Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs. Conventionally, experts need to understand the design specifications and write the SVA assertions, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, with the recent advancement of transformer models, the Large Language Models (LLMs) assisted assertion generation for design verification is gaining interest in recent times. Motivated by this, we proposed a novel LLM-based framework, LAAG-RV, to generate SVA from the natural language specifications of the design. Our framework provides a one-time Verilog loop for signal synchronization in the generated SVA to improve the generated assertion quality. For our experiments, we created a custom LLM based on OpenAI GPT-4. Furthermore, we developed test cases to validate the LLM-generated assertions. Initial observations show that some generated assertions contain issues and did not pass all the test cases. However, by iteratively prompting the LLMs using carefully crafted manual prompts derived from test case failures in a simulator, the framework can generate correct SVAs. Our results on OpenTitan designs demonstrate that LLMs significantly simplify the process of generating assertions, making it efficient and less error-prone.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Differentiable Lithography Imaging Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the electronics industry, driven by Moore's law and the proliferation of integrated circuits, has led to significant advancements in modern society, including the Internet, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this progress is optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing that accounts for approximately 30\% to 40\% of production costs. As semiconductor nodes shrink and transistor numbers increase, optical lithography becomes increasingly vital in current integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology. This paper introduces an open-source differentiable lithography imaging framework that leverages the principles of differentiable programming and the computational power of GPUs to enhance the precision of lithography modeling and simplify the optimization of resolution enhancement techniques (RETs). The framework models the core components of lithography as differentiable segments, allowing for the implementation of standard scalar imaging models, including the Abbe and Hopkins models, as well as their approximation models. The paper introduces a computational lithography framework that optimizes semiconductor manufacturing processes using advanced computational techniques and differentiable programming. It compares imaging models and provides tools for enhancing resolution, demonstrating improved semiconductor patterning performance. The open-sourced framework represents a significant advancement in lithography technology, facilitating collaboration in the field.

      <title>MedCodER: A Generative AI Assistant for Medical Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical coding is essential for standardizing clinical data and communication but is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods struggle with automating coding due to the large label space, lengthy text inputs, and the absence of supporting evidence annotations that justify code selection. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges. In this work, we introduce MedCodER, a Generative AI framework for automatic medical coding that leverages extraction, retrieval, and re-ranking techniques as core components. MedCodER achieves a micro-F1 score of 0.60 on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code prediction, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present a new dataset containing medical records annotated with disease diagnoses, ICD codes, and supporting evidence texts (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13308316). Ablation tests confirm that MedCodER's performance depends on the integration of each of its aforementioned components, as performance declines when these components are evaluated in isolation.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Internet of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, their capability to generate content is seeing significant enhancement, leading to widespread applications in the field of data generation and forecasting. Furthermore, GenAI has strong capabilities in data modeling and analysis, which enhances Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) applications in various aspects. In this paper, we investigate and survey applications of GenAI in the IoEV. Specifically, we categorize GenAI for IoEV into four different layers namely, EV's battery layer, individual electric vehicle (EV) layer, smart grid with EV layer, and security layer. We first introduce various GenAI techniques used in each layer of IoEV applications. Subsequently, public datasets available for training the GenAI models are summarized. Finally, we provide recommendations for future directions. This survey not only categorizes the applications of GenAI in IoEV across different layers but also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by highlighting the design and implementation challenges within each layer. Furthermore, it provides a roadmap for future research directions, enabling the development of more robust and efficient IoEV systems through the integration of advanced GenAI techniques.</description>
