      <title>Anticipatory Gains and Event-Driven Losses in Blockchain-Based Fan Tokens: Evidence from the FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National football teams increasingly issue tradeable blockchain-based fan tokens to strategically enhance fan engagement. This study investigates the impact of 2022 World Cup matches on the dynamic performance of each team's fan token. The event study uncovers fan token returns surged six months before the World Cup, driven by positive anticipation effects. However, intraday analysis reveals a reversal of fan token returns consistently declining and trading volumes rising as matches unfold. To explain findings, we uncover asymmetries whereby defeats in high-stake matches caused a plunge in fan token returns, compared to low-stake matches, intensifying in magnitude for knockout matches. Contrarily, victories enhance trading volumes, reflecting increased market activity without a corresponding positive effect on returns. We align findings with the classic market adage "buy the rumor, sell the news," unveiling cognitive biases and nuances in investor sentiment, cautioning the dichotomy of pre-event optimism and subsequent performance declines.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Measure of Name Concentration Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning approach for the quantification of name concentration risk in loan portfolios. Our approach is tailored for small portfolios and allows for both an actuarial as well as a mark-to-market definition of loss. The training of our neural network relies on Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling which we explicitly formulate for the CreditRisk${+}$ and the ratings-based CreditMetrics model. Numerical results based on simulated as well as real data demonstrate the accuracy of our new approach and its superior performance compared to existing analytical methods for assessing name concentration risk in small and concentrated portfolios.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Economics and the Second-Order Economic Theory. What is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The economic and financial variables of economic agents determine macroeconomic variables. Current models consider agents' variables that are determined by the sums of values and volumes of agents' trades during some time interval {\Delta}. We call them first-order economic variables. We describe how the volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes determine price volatility. We argue that such a link requests consideration of agents' economic variables of the second order that are composed of sums of squares of agents' transactions during {\Delta}. Almost any variable of the first order should be complemented by its second-order pair. Respectively, the sums of agents' second-order variables introduce macroeconomic variables of the second order. The description of the first- and second-order macroeconomic variables establishes the subject of second-order economic theory. We highlight that the complexity of second-order economic theory essentially restricts any hopes for precise predictions of price probability and, at best, could provide estimates of price volatility. That limits the predictions of price probability to Gauss's approximations only.</description>
