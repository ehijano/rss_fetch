      <title>Towards Reverse-Engineering the Brain: Brain-Derived Neuromorphic Computing Approach with Photonic, Electronic, and Ionic Dynamicity in 3D integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain has immense learning capabilities at extreme energy efficiencies and scale that no artificial system has been able to match. For decades, reverse engineering the brain has been one of the top priorities of science and technology research. Despite numerous efforts, conventional electronics-based methods have failed to match the scalability, energy efficiency, and self-supervised learning capabilities of the human brain. On the other hand, very recent progress in the development of new generations of photonic and electronic memristive materials, device technologies, and 3D electronic-photonic integrated circuits (3D EPIC ) promise to realize new brain-derived neuromorphic systems with comparable connectivity, density, energy-efficiency, and scalability. When combined with bio-realistic learning algorithms and architectures, it may be possible to realize an 'artificial brain' prototype with general self-learning capabilities. This paper argues the possibility of reverse-engineering the brain through architecting a prototype of a brain-derived neuromorphic computing system consisting of artificial electronic, ionic, photonic materials, devices, and circuits with dynamicity resembling the bio-plausible molecular, neuro/synaptic, neuro-circuit, and multi-structural hierarchical macro-circuits of the brain based on well-tested computational models. We further argue the importance of bio-plausible local learning algorithms applicable to the neuromorphic computing system that capture the flexible and adaptive unsupervised and self-supervised learning mechanisms central to human intelligence. Most importantly, we emphasize that the unique capabilities in brain-derived neuromorphic computing prototype systems will enable us to understand links between specific neuronal and network-level properties with system-level functioning and behavior.</description>

      <title>Prospects for non-linear memristors as so-far missing core hardware element for transferless data computing and storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We like and need Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) for data processing. This is measureable in the exponential growth of data processed by ICT, e.g. ICT for cryptocurrency mining and search engines. So far, the energy demand for computing technology has increased by a factor of 1.38 every ten years due to the exponentially increasing use of ICT systems as computing devices. The energy consumption of ICT systems is expected to rise from 1500 TWh (8% of global electricity consumption) in 2010 to 5700 TWh (14% of global electricity consumption) in 2030. A large part of this energy is required for the continuous data transfer between the separated memory and processor units which constitute the main components of ICT computing devices in von-Neumann architecture. This at the same time massively slows down the computing power of ICT systems in the von-Neumann architecture. In addition, due to the increasing complexity of AI compute algorithms, since 2010 the AI training compute time demand for computing technology increases tenfold every year, for example in the period from 2010 to 2020 from 1x10^{-6} to 1x10^{+4} Petaflops/Day. It has been theoretically predicted that ICT systems in the neuromorphic computer architecture will circumvent all of this through the use of merged memory and processor units. However, the core hardware element for this has not yet been realized so far. In this work we discuss the prespectives for non-linear resistive switches as the core hardware element for merged memory and processor units in neuromorphic computers.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Solvers in Production: how to succeed in the NISQ era?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10302v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum computing is considered the present and the future within the field of quantum computing. Far from being a passing fad, this trend cannot be considered just a stopgap to address the limitations of NISQ-era devices. The foundations linking both computing paradigms will remain robust over time. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we describe and categorize some of the most frequently used hybrid solvers, resorting to two different taxonomies recently published in the literature. Secondly, we put a special focus on two solvers that are currently deployed in real production and that have demonstrated to be near the real industry. These solvers are the LeapHybridBQMSampler contained in D-Wave's Hybrid Solver Service and Quantagonia's Hybrid Solver. We analyze the performance of both methods using as benchmarks four combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-hop Secure UWOC assisted Local Area Network for UIoT and Underwater Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>
