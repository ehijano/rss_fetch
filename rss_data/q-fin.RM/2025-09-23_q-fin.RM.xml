      <title>The randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a G-randomly distorted capacity and risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a capacity c on a measurable space ({\Omega},F), where the capacity c is distorted by a G-measurable random distortion function (with G a sub-{\sigma}-algebra of F). We establish some fundamental properties, including the comonotonic additivity of these integrals under suitable assumptions on the underlying capacity space. We provide a representation result for comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the first-order stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c) in terms of these randomly distorted Choquet integrals. We also present the case where the random distortion functions are concave. In this case, the G-randomly distorted Choquet integrals are characterised in terms of comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the stop-loss stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c). We provide examples, extending some well-known risk measures in finance and insurance, such as the Value at Risk and the Average Value at Risk.</description>

      <title>Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>
