      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

      <title>A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a &lt;50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear calcium King plot constrains new bosons and nuclear properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearities in King plots (KP) of isotope shifts (IS) can reveal the existence of beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) interactions that couple electrons and neutrons. However, it is crucial to distinguish higher-order Standard Model (SM) effects from BSM physics. We measure the IS of the transitions ${{}^{3}P_{0}~\rightarrow~{}^{3}P_{1}}$ in $\mathrm{Ca}^{14+}$ and ${{}^{2}S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^{2}D_{5/2}}$ in $\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$ with sub-Hz precision as well as the nuclear mass ratios with relative uncertainties below $4\times10^{-11}$ for the five stable, even isotopes of calcium (${}^{40,42,44,46,48}\mathrm{Ca}$). Combined, these measurements yield a calcium KP nonlinearity with a significance of $\sim 900 \sigma$. Precision calculations show that the nonlinearity cannot be fully accounted for by the expected largest higher-order SM effect, the second-order mass shift, and identify the little-studied nuclear polarization as the only remaining SM contribution that may be large enough to explain it. Despite the observed nonlinearity, we improve existing KP-based constraints on a hypothetical Yukawa interaction for most of the new boson masses between $10~\mathrm{eV/c^2}$ and $10^7~\mathrm{eV/c^2}$.</description>

      <title>Thermal atoms facilitate intensity clipping between vectorial dual-beam generated by a single metasurface chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating vector beams is pivotal in fields such as particle manipulation, image processing, and quantum communication. Flexibly adjusting the intensity distribution of these beams is crucial for effectively realizing these applications. This study introduces a vectorial dual-beam system utilizing thermal atoms as the medium for modulating the intensity profile of vector beams. A single metasurface is employed to generate both the control and signal vector beams, each with unique vectorial characteristics. The shaping of the signal beam profile is facilitated by the interaction with thermal atoms, which can be controlled by adjusting the control vector beam. This spatially selective absorption is a result of the thermal atoms' response to the varying polarizations within the vector beams. In this experiment, two distinct metasurface chips are fabricated to generate vector beams with doughnut-shaped and Gaussian-shaped intensity profiles. By adjusting the incident power and polarization state of the control light, the doughnut-shaped signal beams can be converted into a rotational dual-lobed pattern or the dimensions of the Gaussian-distributed signal beams can be modified. This study introduces a novel vector beam shaping technique by integrating metasurfaces with thermal atoms, offering significant promise for future applications requiring miniaturization, dynamic operation, and versatile control capabilities.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Tailoring sub-Doppler spectra of thermal atoms with a dielectric optical metasurface chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact and robust structures to precisely control and acquire atomic spectra are increasingly important for the pursuit of widespread applications. Sub-Doppler responses of thermal atoms are critical in constructing high-precision devices and systems. In this study, we designed a nanograting metasurface specifically for atomic rubidium vapor and integrated it into a miniature vapor cell. Using the metasurface with built-in multifunctional controls for light, we established pump-probe atomic spectroscopy and experimentally observed sub-Doppler responses at low incident power. Moreover, the sub-Doppler lineshape can be tailored by varying the incident polarization state. The spectrum transformation from absorption to transparency was observed. Using one of the sharp responses, laser stabilization with a stability of $3\times10^{-10}$ at 2 s can be achieved. Our work reveals the effective control of atomic spectra with optical metasurface chips, which may have great potential for future developments in fundamental optics and novel optical applications.</description>

      <title>Generation of massively entangled bright states of light during harmonic generation in resonant media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such non-trivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wavefunction, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near-resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.</description>

      <title>High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose a conceptual design for an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering, and we provide the requirements on the beam spectrum and reducible backgrounds such that a detection may be achieved. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>Scattering phase shifts from overlap relations in the $J$-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering problem can be implemented in a square-integrable basis via the so-called $J$-matrix method. While methods to compute the phase shift in the $J$-matrix approach are known, we introduce a novel formula in square-integrable bases analogous to existing integral relations or overlap integrals in a (continuous) position basis. We demonstrate the method in single-channel potential scattering. Such a result is the first step towards a more general approach to scattering and reactions in popular many-body methods such as the configuration-interaction shell model.</description>
