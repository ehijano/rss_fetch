      <title>The Optimal Growth Mode in the Relaxation to Statistical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems far from equilibrium approach stability slowly due to "anti-mixing" characterized by regions of the phase-space that remain disconnected after prolonged action of the flow. We introduce the Optimal Growth Mode (OGM) to capture this slow initial relaxation. The OGM is calculated from Markov matrices approximating the action of the Fokker-Planck operator onto the phase space. It is obtained as the mode having the largest growth in energy before decay. Important nuances between the OGM and the more traditional slowest decaying mode are detailed in the case of the Lorenz 63 model. The implications for understanding how complex systems respond to external forces, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often stated that the second law of thermodynamics follows from the condition that at some given time in the past the entropy was lower than it is now. Formally, this condition is the statement that $E[S(t)|S(t_0)]$, the expected entropy of the universe at the current time $t$ conditioned on its value $S(t_0)$ at a time $t_0$ in the past, is an increasing function of $t $. We point out that in general this is incorrect. The epistemic axioms underlying probability theory say that we should condition expectations on all that we know, and on nothing that we do not know. Arguably, we know the value of the universe's entropy at the present time $t$ at least as well as its value at a time in the past, $t_0$. However, as we show here, conditioning expected entropy on its value at two times rather than one radically changes its dynamics, resulting in a unexpected, very rich structure. For example, the expectation value conditioned on two times can have a maximum at an intermediate time between $t_0$ and $t$, i.e., in our past. Moreover, it can have a negative rather than positive time derivative at the present. In such "Boltzmann bridge" situations, the second law would not hold at the present time. We illustrate and investigate these phenomena for a random walk model and an idealized gas model, and briefly discuss the role of Boltzmann bridges in our universe.</description>

      <title>Efficiency bounds for bipartite information-driven thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to derive a lower bound for the entropy production rate of a subsystem by utilizing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It extends to establishing comprehensive upper and lower bounds for the efficiency of two subsystems. These bounds are applicable to a wide range of Markovian stochastic processes, which enhances the accuracy in depicting the range of energy conversion efficiency between subsystems. Empirical validation is conducted using a two-quantum-dot system model, which serves to confirm the effectiveness of our inequality in refining the boundaries of efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal patterns in the active cyclic Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three state Potts model is studied on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations and continuum theory. This model is relevant to chemical reactions on a catalytic surface and to molecular transport across a membrane. Several characteristic modes are formed depending on the flipping energies between successive states and the contact energies between neighboring sites. Under cyclic symmetry conditions, cycling homogeneous phases and spiral waves form at low and high flipping energies, respectively. In the intermediate flipping energy regime, these two modes coexist temporally in small systems and/or at low contact energies. Under asymmetric conditions, we observed small biphasic domains exhibiting amoeba-like locomotion and temporal coexistence of spiral waves and a dominant non-cyclic one-state phase. An increase in the flipping energy between two successive states, say state 0 and state 1, while keeping the other flipping energies constant, induces the formation of the third phase (state 2), owing to the suppression of the nucleation of state 0 domains. Under asymmetric conditions regarding the contact energies, two different modes can appear depending on the initial state, due to a hysteresis phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy tradeoff and its effect in the game of cricket: predictive modeling from statistical mechanics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed-accuracy tradeoffs are prevalent in a wide range of physical systems. In this paper, we demonstrate speed-accuracy tradeoffs in the game of cricket, where 'batters' score runs on the balls bowled by the 'bowlers'. It is shown that the run scoring rate by a batter and the probability of dismissal follow a power-law relation. Due to availability of extensive data, game of cricket is an excellent model for the study of the effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff on the overall performance of the system. It is shown that the exponent of the power-law governs the nature of the adaptability of the player in different conditions and can be used for their assessment. Further, it is demonstrated that the players with extreme values of the power-law exponent are better suited for different playing conditions as compared to the ones with moderate values. These findings can be utilized to identify the potential of the cricket players for different game formats and can further help team management in devising strategies for the best outcomes with a given set of players.</description>

      <title>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the asymptotic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

      <title>Modular properties of massive scalar partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact thermal partition functions of a massive scalar field on flat spacetime backgrounds of the form $\mathbb R^{d-q}\times \mathbb T^{q+1}$ and show that they possess an ${\rm SL}(q+1,\mathbb Z)$ symmetry. Non-trivial relations between equivalent expressions for the result are obtained by doing the computation using functional, canonical and worldline methods. For $q=1$, the results exhibit modular symmetry and may be expressed in terms of massive Maass-Jacobi forms. In the complex case with chemical potential for ${\rm U}(1)$ charge turned on, the usual discussion of relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation is modified by the presence of the small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Active Polar Ring Polymer in Shear Flow -- An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.</description>

      <title>Simulating anharmonic crystals: Lights and shadows of first-principles approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Two powerful methodologies have emerged as frontrunners in this exploration: the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) with its counterpart, Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked, and the absence of a formal derivation for the TDEP has led to significant missteps that hamper its predictive accuracy.
  Here, the theoretical foundations of both SCHA and TDEP are revised, unveiling their profound interconnection. This work introduces formal derivation for TDEP, dispelling misconceptions about how to improve its accuracy and refining best practices. The perturbative limit of these methods uncovers that both SCHA and TDEP fall short in reproducing the lowest-order perturbative free energy. While TDEP excels in providing an exact treatment of the static susceptibility, its dynamical extension violates the perturbative regime by overcounting anharmonicity. Conversely, SCHA delivers an approximate static susceptibility but maintains correct static and dynamic response functions within the perturbative limit.
  This work introduces a corrective strategy for TDEP's dynamical extension to address these shortcomings. All the claims provided here are benchmarked against the exact (numerical) solution on a simple one-dimensional anharmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Collective advantages in qubit reset: effect of coherent qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer principle sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of qubit reset, which is only attainable for the quasistatic process. In this Letter, we explore the collective advantage of qubit reset of coherent qubits in three aspects. First, for the quasistatic process, the thermodynamic cost of collective reset is remarkably lower than parallel reset because of the reduced Hilbert space dimension due to entanglement effects. Second, for the finite-time qubit reset, we prove that the error probability fades away and per-qubit heat production tends the Landauer bound for initially continuous protocols in the thermodynamic limit. Third, we show that qubit reset performance enhances with the increase in the number of qubits. Our results, illustrated by different protocols, provide a blueprint for future quantum device fabrication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum entanglement of a manybody is not well understood. Here we numerically study the amount of tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states that can be extracted from the state generated by random Clifford circuits with probabilistic single-qubit projective measurements. We find a GHZ-entangled phase where this amount is finite and a GHZ-trivial phase where no tripartite entanglement is available. The transition between them is either measurement-induced, at $p_c\approx 0.16$, or partition-induced when a party contains more than half of the qubits. We find that the GHZ entanglement can be enhanced by measurements in certain regimes, which could be understood from the perspective of quantum Internet. Effects of the measurements to the growth of GHZ entanglement are also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-guided Monte Carlo is an adaptive method to simulate classical interacting systems. It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising for instance both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $N$ fracton problem in classical mechanics, with fractons defined as point particles that conserve multipole moments up to a given order. We find that the nonlinear Machian dynamics of the fractons is characterized by late-time attractors in position-velocity space for all $N$, despite the absence of attractors in phase space dictated by Liouville's theorem. These attractors violate ergodicity and lead to non-equilibrium steady states, which always break translational symmetry, even in spatial dimensions where the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem for equilibrium systems forbids such breaking. While a full understanding of the many-body nonlinear problem is a formidable and incomplete task, we provide a conceptual understanding of our results using an adiabatic approximation for the late-time trajectories and an analogy with the idea of `order-by-disorder' borrowed from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Altogether, these fracton systems host a new paradigm for Hamiltonian dynamics and non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>How general is the Jensen--Varadhan large deviation functional for 1D conservation laws?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic particle model whose hydrodynamic limit under hyperbolic space-time scaling is a 1D conservation law, we derive the large deviation rate function encoding the probability to observe a density profile which is a non entropic shock, and compare this large deviation rate function with the classical Jensen-Varadhan functional, valid for the totally asymmetric exclusion process and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process in the strong asymmetry limit. We find that these two functionals have no reason to coincide, and in this sense Jensen-Varadhan functional is not universal. However, they do coincide in a small Mach number limit, suggesting that universality is restored in this regime. We then compute the leading order correction to the Jensen-Varadhan functional.</description>

Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information theoretic-based randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation functions in the Ising field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>A subpolynomial-time algorithm for the free energy of one-dimensional quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical algorithm to approximate the free energy of local, translation-invariant, one-dimensional quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain size. While the ground state problem (i.e., the free energy at temperature $T = 0$) for these systems is expected to be computationally hard even for quantum computers, our algorithm runs for any fixed temperature $T &gt; 0$ in subpolynomial time, i.e., in time $O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{c})$ for any constant $c &gt; 0$ where $\varepsilon$ is the additive approximation error. Previously, the best known algorithm had a runtime that is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$. Our algorithm is also particularly simple as it reduces to the computation of the spectral radius of a linear map. This linear map has an interpretation as a noncommutative transfer matrix and has been studied previously to prove results on the analyticity of the free energy and the decay of correlations. We also show that the corresponding eigenvector of this map gives an approximation of the marginal of the Gibbs state and thereby allows for the computation of various thermodynamic properties of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state approximations to quantum states of low energy variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently simulate pure quantum states in one dimensional systems that have both finite energy density and vanishingly small energy fluctuations. We do so by studying the performance of a tensor network algorithm that produces matrix product states whose energy variance decreases as the bond dimension increases. Our results imply that variances as small as $\propto 1/\log N$ can be achieved with polynomial bond dimension. With this, we prove that there exist states with a very narrow support in the bulk of the spectrum that still have moderate entanglement entropy, in contrast with typical eigenstates that display a volume law. Our main technical tool is the Berry-Esseen theorem for spin systems, a strengthening of the central limit theorem for the energy distribution of product states. We also give a simpler proof of that theorem, together with slight improvements in the error scaling, which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter critical quantum metrology with impurity probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature, the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.</description>

      <title>Kinetically constrained models constructed from dissipative quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of kinetically constrained models using the Markovian quantum dynamics under strong dissipation. Engineering the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation through classical noise, we show that strong dissipation leads to the emergent decoherence-free subspaces, within which constrained quantum many-body unitary dynamics can take place. We argue that the unitary dynamics constructed by the GKSL dynamics is more tightly constrained than that constructed by the strongly interacting Hamiltonian, where the interactions have the same form with the GKSL jump operators. As an example, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin system with two-site dissipation leads to the kinetically constrained "PXQ" model, which exhibits the free domain-wall motion with an additional frozen-block structure. Under a uniform magnetic field, the PXQ model shows the domain-wall localization, similar to the Wannier-Stark localization. We then couple two PXQ chains with the magnetic field by an inter-chain interaction. We discover that, while localization of the domain walls persists despite the interactions for typical parameter regimes, a non-trivial partial delocalization appears for a certain parameter line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we have studied collectives of active disks with an energy depot, moving in the two-dimensional plane and interacting via excluded volume. The energy depot accounts for the extraction of energy taking place at the level of each particle in order to perform self-propulsion, included in an underdampled Langevin dynamics. We show that this model undergoes a flocking transition, exhibiting some of the key features of the Vicsek model, namely, band formation and giant number fluctuations. Large density bands disappear as the activity is further increased, eventually reaching a homogeneous polar state. We unravel an effective alignment interaction at the level of two-particle collisions that can be controlled by activity and gives rise to flocking at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate thermodynamic and structural quantities of a fluid of hard spheres of diameter $\sigma$ in a quasi-one-dimensional pore with accessible pore width $W $ smaller than $\sigma$ by applying a perturbative method worked out earlier for a confined fluid in a slit pore [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{109}, 240601 (2012)]. In a first step, we prove that the thermodynamic and a certain class of structural quantities of the hard-sphere fluid in the pore can be obtained from a purely one-dimensional fluid of rods of length $ \sigma$ with a central hard core of size $\sigma_W =\sqrt{\sigma^2 - W^2}$ and a soft part at both ends of length $(\sigma-\sigma_W)/2$. These rods interact via effective $k$-body potentials $v^{(k)}_\text{eff}$ ($k \geq 2$) . The two- and the three-body potential will be calculated explicitly. In a second step, the free energy of this effective one-dimensional fluid is calculated up to leading order in $ (W/\sigma)^2$. Explicit results for, e.g. the perpendicular pressure, surface tension, and the density profile as a function of density, temperature, and pore width are presented presented and partly compared with results from Monte-Carlo simulations and standard virial expansions. Despite the perturbative character of our approach it encompasses the singularity of the thermodynamic quantities at the jamming transition point.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>
