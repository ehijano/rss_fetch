      <title>MolCluster: Integrating Graph Neural Network with Community Detection for Coarse-Grained Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling simplifies molecular systems by mapping groups of atoms into representative units. However, traditional CG approaches rely on fixed mapping rules, which limit their ability to handle diverse chemical systems and require extensive manual intervention. Thus, supervised learning-based CG methods have been proposed, enabling more automated and adaptable mapping. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from limited labeled datasets and the inability to control mapping resolution, which is essential for multiscale modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose MolCluster, an unsupervised model that integrates a graph neural network and a community detection algorithm to extract CG representations. Additionally, a predefined group pair loss ensures the preservation of target groups, and a bisection strategy enables precise, customizable resolution across different molecular systems. In the case of the downstream task, evaluations on the MARTINI2 dataset demonstrate that MolCluster, benefiting from its label-free pretraining strategy, outperforms both traditional clustering and supervised models. Overall, these results highlight the potential of MolCluster as a core model for customizable and chemically consistent CG mapping.</description>

      <title>A Reformulation of UVN-Flash for Multicomponent Two-Phase Systems with Application to CO2-rich Mixture Transport in Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Strain localization in reduced order asymptotic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reduced order asymptotic homogenization based multiscale technique which can capture damage and inelastic effects in composite materials is proposed. This technique is based on two scale homogenization procedure where eigen strain representation accounts for the inelastic response and the computational efforts are alleviated by reduction of order technique. Macroscale stress is derived by calculating the influence tensors from the analysis of representative volume element (RVE). At microscale, the damage in the material is modeled using continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based framework. To solve the problem of strain localization a method of the alteration of stress-strain relation of micro con- stituents based on the dissipated fracture energy in a crack band is implemented. The issue of spurious post failure artificial stiffness at macroscale is discussed and effect of increasing the order to alleviate this problem is checked. Verification studies demonstrated the proposed formulation predicts the macroscale response and also captures the damage and plasticity induced inelastic strains.</description>

      <title>E$^2$-TFA based multiscale analysis of failure in elasto-plastic composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a novel homogenization methodology for analyzing the failure of elastoplastic composite materials based on elastic and eigen influence tensors-driven transformation field analysis ($\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA). The proposed technique considers the microscopic eigenstrain field accounting for intra-phase damage and inelastic strains. This results in realistic computations by alleviating the post-damage stiffness response, which is a drawback of TFA-based methods. We attain computational efficiency by identifying the preprocessing data solely from the elastic and eigen transformation functions and adopting a reduced order modelling technique with a piecewise constant eigenstrain field throughout the subdomains. The performance of the model is assessed by simulating the response for (a) the representative volume element (RVE) as a homogenized continuum and (b) the various composites under complex load histories with intricate macroscale morphologies. Furthermore, the nonlinear shear stress-strain response of a glass fiber composite is calculated and compared to experimentally measured fracture initiation parameters, failure plane orientation, and strain histories. Finally, we show that $\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA can accurately and efficiently capture damage and inelastic deformations in order to estimate the mechanical response of composite materials in a better way.</description>

      <title>Characterizing failure morphologies in fiber-reinforced composites via k-means clustering based multiscale framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel homogenization methodology is proposed for analyzing the failure of fiber-reinforced composite materials, utilizing elastic and eigen influence tensors within a damage informed transformation field analysis (D-TFA) framework. This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.</description>

      <title>A relativistic coupled-cluster treatment of magnetic hyperfine structure of the $X^2\Pi$ and $A^2\Sigma^+$ states of OH isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Ab initio}$ calculations of the parallel component of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant have been carried out for hydroxyl radical isotopologues ($^{16,17}$OH(D)) over the internuclear distance range $R \in [0.6, 1.8]$ \r{A}. For the ground electronic state $X^2\Pi$, the HFS functions were evaluated for contributions induced by both oxygen and hydrogen nuclei. In addition, the hydrogen-induced HFS curve was calculated for the excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ state. The quantum-chemistry study employs a four-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations up to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes was studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative calculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions represent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date exhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced HFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational levels ($v\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged $\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within $1\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range over which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous studies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of higher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and non-adiabatic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Gaussian splatting holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-line holography offers high space-bandwidth product imaging with a simplified lens-free optical system. However, in-line holographic reconstruction is troubled by twin images arising from the Hermitian symmetry of complex fields. Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the ill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the unknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning or non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with twin-image disturbance. We propose the Gaussian splatting holography (GSH) for twin-image-suppressed holographic reconstruction. GSH uses Gaussian splatting for optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown parameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase retrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally, the Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with noisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying profile. Experiments show that GSH achieves constraint-free recovery for in-line holography with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio equal to 26 dB, and structure similarity equal to 0.8. Combined with total variation, GSH can be further improved, obtaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31 dB, and a high compression ability of up to 15 folds.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Nanophotonic Inverse Design using Volume Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic devices with minimal human intervention has gained substantial attention due to the complexity and precision required in modern optical technologies. While inverse design techniques typically rely on conventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization routines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of nanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation methods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the volume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to traditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method tailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization gradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy compatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our VIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and frequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we successfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective mode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter. Our results underscore the significant runtime advantages offered by the VIE-based framework, highlighting its promising role in accelerating inverse design workflows for next-generation nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Monte Carlo simulation of the Enskog equation for multiscale dense gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general synthetic iterative scheme is proposed to solve the Enskog equation within a Monte Carlo framework. The method demonstrates rapid convergence by reducing intermediate Monte Carlo evolution and preserves the asymptotic-preserving property, enabling spatial cell sizes much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flows. This is realized through mesoscopic-macroscopic two-way coupling: the mesoscopic Monte Carlo simulation provides high-order constitutive relations to close the moment (synthetic) equation, while the macroscopic synthetic equation, once solved toward steady state, directs the evolution of simulation particles in the Monte Carlo method. The accuracy of the proposed general synthetic iterative scheme is verified through one-dimensional normal shock wave and planar Fourier heat transfer problems, while its fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties are demonstrated in the force-driven Poiseuille flow and two-dimensional hypersonic cylinder flow and low-speed porous media flow, where the simulation time is reduced by several orders of magnitude in near-continuum flows. With the proposed method, a brief analysis is conducted on the role of the adsorption layer in porous media flow, mimicking shale gas extraction.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks for design optimisation of diamond particle detectors for charged particle fast-tracking at high luminosity hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.06719v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing algorithm for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We use a normalization procedure to encode the SPH operators and domain discretization in a quantum register. We then perform the SPH summation via an inner product of quantum registers. Using a one-dimensional function, we test the approach in a classical sense for the kernel sum and first and second derivatives of a one-dimensional function, using both the Gaussian and Wendland kernel functions, and compare various register sizes against analytical results. Error convergence is exponentially fast in the number of qubits. We extend the method to solve the one-dimensional advection and diffusion partial differential equations, which are commonly encountered in fluids simulations. This work provides a foundation for a more general SPH algorithm, eventually leading to highly efficient simulations of complex engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, aerospace engineering, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

      <title>Coercivity influence of nanostructure in SmCo-1:7 magnets: Machine learning of high-throughput micromagnetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a pinning-controlled permanent magnet, tailoring the cellular nanostructure of samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets remains crucial for improving magnetic performance. Jointing forward and inverse machine learning models with the high-throughput micromagnetic simulations (42,300 runs), we identify the nanostructural and magnetic features that are most effective for coercivity, combining both nucleation and pinning mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the 1:5-phase enhances coercivity by providing high anisotropy, and the Z-phase strengthens pinning through fluctuations in domain wall energy. Cu additions in the 1:5-phase significantly reduce coercivity, while Fe substitutions in the 2:17-phase modestly reduce coercivity but improve pinning locally and increase saturation magnetization. Among all examined features, magnetocrystalline misorientation emerges as the dominant factor. Finally, the framework enables the inverse design of nanostructures with prescribed coercivity, demonstrating a computationally cost-effective toolkit for guiding the performance tailoring of SmCo-1:7 magnets.</description>

Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>

Abstract: In this review, we present recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are due to specific atomic order effects without electron interactions. These states are always indicative of some form of confinement and have consequences on the electronic properties. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene (TBG) or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms). We have shown that their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In the case of TBG, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on two-dimensional nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>

Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Discovery Learning accelerates battery design evaluation</title>

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>
