      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs under the assumption that the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, by a modified Picard iteration method. Then, we derive the comparison principle by analyzing associated linear BSDEs and further establish regularity results for the solutions. Finally, by combining the regularity results with a localization argument, we extend the well-posedness result to the case where $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. As applications, we derive nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of partial differential equations with Young drivers (Young PDEs), and we also investigate BSDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficient functions as well as linear stochastic heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for stochastic nonlinear wave equation with pure-jump L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the random field solution to the stochastic nonlinear wave equation (SNLW) with constant initial conditions and multiplicative noise $\sigma(u)\dot{L}$, where the nonlinearity is encoded in a Lipschitz function $\sigma: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ and $\dot{L}$ denotes a pure-jump L\'evy white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}$ with finite variance. Combining tools from It\^o calculus and Malliavin calculus, we are able to establish the Malliavin differentiability of the solution with sharp moment bounds for the Malliavin derivatives. As an easy consequence, we obtain the spatial ergodicity of the solution to SNLW that leads to a law of large number result for the spatial integrals of the solution over $[-R, R]$ as $R\to\infty$. One of the main results of this paper is the obtention of the corresponding Gaussian fluctuation with rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance. To achieve this goal, we adapt the discrete Malliavin-Stein bound from Peccati, Sol\'e, Taqqu, and Utzet ({\it Ann. Probab.}, 2010), and further combine it with the aforementioned moment bounds of Malliavin derivatives and It\^o tools. Our work substantially improves our previous results (\textit{Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.}, 2024) on the linear equation that heavily relied on the explicit chaos expansion of the solution. In current work, we also establish a functional version, an almost sure version of the central limit theorems, and the (quantitative) asymptotic independence of spatial integrals from the solution. The asymptotic independence result is established based on an observation of L. Pimentel (\textit{Ann.~Probab.}, 2022) and a further adaptation of Tudor's generalization (\textit{Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.}, 2025) to the Poisson setting.</description>

      <title>Noncentral moderate deviations for time-changed multivariate L\'evy processes with linear combinations of inverse stable subordinators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term noncentral moderate deviations is used in the literature to mean a class of large deviation principles that, in some sense, fills the gap between the convergence in probability to a constant (governed by a reference large deviation principle) and a weak convergence to a non-Gaussian (and non-degenerating) distribution. Some noncentral moderate deviation results in the literature concern time-changed univariate L\'evy processes, where the time-changes are given by inverse stable subordinators. In this paper we present analogue results for multivariate L\'evy processes; in particular the random time-changes are suitable linear combinations of independent inverse stable subordinators.</description>

      <title>Discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete analogues of many classical operators in harmonic analysis have been widely studied for many years with interesting connections to other areas in mathematics, including ergodic theory and analytic number theory. This paper concerns the problem of identifying the $\ell^p$-norms of discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms. Using probabilistic techniques, a class of second-order discrete Riesz transforms $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ is constructed on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. It is shown that their $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ norms, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, are the same as the norms of the classical second-order Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ differ from the harmonic analysis analogues of the discrete Riesz transforms, $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$, by convolution with a function in $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. Applications are given to the discrete Beurling-Ahlfors operator. It is shown that the operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ arise by discretization of a class of Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals $T^{(jk)}$ which differ from the classical Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ by convolution with a function in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction $\varphi_U$ when the domain $U$ is a perturbation of a bounded inner uniform domain in a strictly local regular Dirichlet space. We prove that if $U$ is suitably contained in between two inner uniform domains, then $\varphi_U$ admits two-sided bounds in terms of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunctions of the two approximating domains. The main ingredients of our proof include domain monotonicity properties associated to Dirichlet boundary conditions, intrinsic ultracontractivity estimates, and parabolic Harnack inequality. As an application of our results, we give explicit expressions comparable to $\varphi_U$ for certain domains $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, as well as improved Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for such domains. We also prove that under a uniform exterior ball condition on $U$, a point achieving the maximum of $\varphi_U$ is separated away from the boundary, complementing a result of Rachh and Steinerberger arXiv:1608.06604. Our principal Dirichlet eigenfunction estimates are applicable to second-order uniformly elliptic operators in Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and Lie groups of polynomial volume growth.</description>

      <title>Entropic continuity bounds for conditional covariances with applications to Schr\" odinger and Sinkhorn bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents new entropic continuity bounds for conditional expectations and conditional covariance matrices.
  These bounds are expressed in terms of the relative entropy between different coupling distributions.
  Our approach combines Wasserstein coupling with quadratic transportation cost inequalities. We illustrate the impact of these results in the context of entropic optimal transport problems.
  The entropic continuity theorem presented in the article allows to estimate
  the conditional expectations and the conditional covariances of Schr\" odinger and Sinkhorn transitions in terms of the relative
  entropy between the corresponding bridges. These entropic continuity bounds turns out to be a very useful tool for obtaining remarkably simple proofs of the exponential decays of the gradient and the Hessian of Schr\"odinger and Sinkhorn bridge potentials.</description>

      <title>Strong Uniqueness by Kraichnan Transport Noise for the 2D Boussinesq Equations with Zero Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inviscid 2D Boussinesq equations driven by rough transport noise of Kraichnan type with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$. For all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of probabilistic strong solutions for all $L^p$ initial vorticity and $L^2$ initial temperature, under the parameter constraint $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 1-1/(p\wedge 2)$. The key ingredient is the anomalous regularity due to the noise proven by Coghi and Maurelli \cite{CogMau} who dealt with stochastic 2D Euler equations. Combining techniques from analysis and probability, we demonstrate how the additional regularity from noise compensates the singularity due to the nonlinear parts and coupled terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lam's reduced random walk in a hyperbolic triangle group, which we view as a random walk in the upper half-plane. We prove that this walk converges almost surely to a point on the extended real line. We devote special attention to the reduced random walk in $PGL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (i.e., the $(2,3,\infty)$ triangle group). In this case, we provide an explicit formula for the cumulative distribution function of the limit. This formula is written in terms of the interrobang function, a new function $!\hspace{-3.8pt}?\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ that shares several of the remarkable analytic and arithmetic properties of Minkowski's question-mark function.</description>

      <title>Limit distribution for sums of inhomogeneous Markovian Bernoulli variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{\eta_i\}_{i\ge 1}$ be a sequence of dependent Bernoulli random variables. While the Poisson approximation for the distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^n\eta_i$ has been extensively studied in the literature, this paper establishes novel convergence regimes characterized by non-Poisson limits. Specifically, when $\{\eta_i\}_{i\ge 1}$ exhibits a Markovian dependence structure, we show that $\sum_{i=1}^n\eta_i,$ under appropriate scaling, converges almost surely or in distribution as $n\to\infty$ to a random variable with geometric or gamma distribution. As concrete applications, we derive the distribution of the number of times the population size in certain branching processes attains a given level.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.</description>

As a special case we consider the Brownian excursion with the identity function as the payoff ($\alpha=3,n=1$). For the Brownian excursion we can give an explicit solution but in the general case we provide a complete solution via a power series expansion.</description>

      <title>The edge-averaging process on graphs with random initial opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several settings (e.g., sensor networks and social networks), nodes of a graph are equipped with initial opinions, and the goal is to estimate the average of these opinions using local operations. A natural algorithm to achieve this is the edge-averaging process, where edges are repeatedly selected at random (according to independent Poisson clocks) and the opinions on the nodes of each selected edge are replaced by their average. The effectiveness of this algorithm is determined by its convergence rate. It is known that on a finite graph of $n$ nodes, the opinions reach approximate consensus in polynomial time. We prove that the convergence is much faster when the initial opinions are disordered (independent identically distributed): the time to reach approximate consensus is $O (\log^2n)$, and this bound is sharp. For infinite graphs, we show that for every $p\geq 1$, if the initial opinions are in $L^p$, then the opinion at each vertex converges to the mean in $L^p$, and if $p&gt;4$, then almost sure convergence holds as well.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the temporal law in KPZ random growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal law of the KPZ fixed point. For the droplet geometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared to a previous formula of Johansson and the author. For the stationary geometry, we find the two-time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains and Ferrari-Spohn. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of corresponding multi-time formulas for geometric last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Allele trees for the mother-dependent neutral mutations model and their scaling limits in the rare mutations regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mother-dependent neutral mutations model describes the evolution of a population across discrete generations, where neutral mutations occur among a finite set of possible alleles. In this model, each mutant child acquires a type different from that of its mother, chosen uniformly at random. In this work, we define a multitype allele tree associated with this model and analyze its scaling limit through a Markov chain that tracks the sizes of allelic subfamilies and their mutant descendants. We show that this Markov chain converges to a continuous-state Markov process, whose transition probabilities depend on the sizes of the initial allelic populations and those of their mutant offspring in the first allelic generation. As a result, the allele tree converges to a multidimensional limiting object, which can be described in terms of the universal allele tree introduced by Bertoin (2010).</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing for Discrete Sources and Quantum Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modular debiasing technique for discrete random sources, addressing the fundamental challenge of extracting high-quality randomness from imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, critically, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise. Analytical bounds show an exponential rate of convergence, which is empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators, enabling efficient extraction of high-quality randomness from experimentally imperfect sources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Privacy-Utility Balance using Synthetic Data and Configurable Perturbation Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the strategic use of modern synthetic data generation and advanced data perturbation techniques to enhance security, maintain analytical utility, and improve operational efficiency when managing large datasets, with a particular focus on the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector. We contrast these advanced methods encompassing generative models like GANs, sophisticated context-aware PII transformation, configurable statistical perturbation, and differential privacy with traditional anonymization approaches.
  The goal is to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets that retain high utility for complex machine learning tasks and analytics, a critical need in the data-sensitive industries like BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, and Telecommunications. We discuss how these modern techniques potentially offer significant improvements in balancing privacy preservation while maintaining data utility compared to older methods. Furthermore, we examine the potential for operational gains, such as reduced overhead and accelerated analytics, by using these privacy-enhanced datasets. We also explore key use cases where these methods can mitigate regulatory risks and enable scalable, data-driven innovation without compromising sensitive customer information.</description>

      <title>A Unified MDL-based Binning and Tensor Factorization Framework for PDF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.</description>

      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Guarantees for Average-Reward Q-Learning with Adaptive Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A key feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which serve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates generated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the mean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm. Moreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function, also at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive stepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to the correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a form of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of asynchronous updates.
  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update depend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making the algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our approach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous Markovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of almost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain concentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the adaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are likely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with adaptive stepsizes.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Condition For Quantile Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is effective in modeling and inferring the conditional quantile given some predictors and has become popular in risk management due to wide applications of quantile-based risk measures. When forecasting risk for economic and financial variables, quantile regression has to account for heteroscedasticity, which raises the question of whether the identification condition on residuals in quantile regression is equivalent to one independent of heteroscedasticity. In this paper, we present some identification conditions under three probability models and use them to establish simplified conditions in quantile regression.</description>

      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

      <title>Test Set Sizing for the Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish except for m and the number of features, n. This is the first time that such a split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first two terms asymptotically, and it appears that practically there is no difference.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Method Through a Push-Out Leibniz Integration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) method through a novel push-out Leibniz integration approach. Extending the conventional push-out likelihood ratio (LR) method, our approach allows the sample space to be parameter-dependent after the change of variables. Specifically, leveraging the Leibniz integral rule enables differentiation of the parameter-dependent sample space, resulting in a surface integral in addition to the usual LR estimator, which may necessitate additional simulation. Furthermore, our approach extends to cases where the change of variables only locally exists. Notably, the derived estimator includes existing GLR estimators as special cases and is applicable to a broader class of discontinuous sample performances. Moreover, the derivation is streamlined and more straightforward, and the requisite regularity conditions are easier to understand and verify.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the unique existence and investigate the $L^{p}$-regularity of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces associated with pseudo-differential operators, driven by Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes that satisfy certain regularity conditions for the covariance kernels of the Gaussian processes. For our purposes, we develop an $L^{p}$-regularity framework for the solutions to the stochastic partial differential equations associated with pseudo-differential operators. As the main tools, we establish the $p$-th moment maximal inequality for stochastic integrals with respect to a Hilbert space-valued Gaussian process and a Littlewood-Paley type inequality for Banach space-valued functions. Additionally, during our study, we improved the sufficient conditions for Fourier multipliers and examined the covariance kernels for Gaussian processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold, $(L,h^L)$ be a positive line bundle, and $(E,h^E)$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$. We prove that the pullback by the Kodaira embedding associated to $L^p\otimes E$ of the $k$-th Chern class of the dual of the universal bundle over the Grassmannian converges as $p\to\infty$ to the $k$-th power of the Chern form $c_1(L,h^L)$, for $0\leq k\leq r$. If $c_1(L,h^L)=\omega$ we also determine the second term in the semiclassical expansion, which involves $c_1(E,h^E)$. As a consequence we show that the limit distribution of zeros of random sequences of holomorphic sections of high powers $L^p\otimes E$ is $c_1(L,h^L)^r$. Furthermore, we compute the expectation of the currents of integration along degeneracy sets of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <title>Simulating integrated Volterra square-root processes and Volterra Heston models via Inverse Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel simulation scheme, iVi (integrated Volterra implicit), for integrated Volterra square-root processes and Volterra Heston models based on the Inverse Gaussian distribution. The scheme is designed to handle $L^1$ kernels with singularities by relying solely on integrated kernel quantities, and it preserves the non-decreasing property of the integrated process. We establish weak convergence of the iVi scheme by reformulating it as a stochastic Volterra equation with a measure kernel and proving a stability result for this class of equations. Numerical results demonstrate that convergence is achieved with very few time steps. Remarkably, for the rough fractional kernel, unlike existing schemes, convergence seems to improve as the Hurst index $H$ decreases and approaches $-1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a planar Coulomb gas confined to a sufficiently smooth Jordan arc $\gamma$ in the complex plane, at inverse temperature $\beta &gt; 0$. Let \[\bar{Z}_{n}^\beta(\gamma) = Z_{n}^\beta(\gamma)/\left(2 \textrm{cap}(\gamma)\right)^{\beta n^2/2+(1-\beta/2)n}\] be the normalized partition function. We compute the free energy as the number of particles tends to infinity, including the constant term: \[ \lim_{n\to \infty}\log \frac{\bar{Z}_{n}^\beta(\gamma)}{\bar{Z}_{n}^\beta([-1,1])} = \frac{1}{24}J^A(\gamma) + \frac{1}{8} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{\beta}{2} } - \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\beta}} \right)^2 J^{F}(\gamma). \] Here $\bar{Z}_{n}^\beta([-1,1])$ is an explicit Selberg integral, $J^A(\gamma)$ is half the Loewner energy of a certain Jordan curve associated to $\gamma$ plus a covariance term, and $J^F(\gamma)$ is the Fekete energy, related to the zero temperature limit of the model.
  We also prove an asymptotic formula for the Laplace transform of linear statistics for sufficiently regular test functions. As a consequence, the centered empirical measure converges to a Gaussian field with explicit asymptotic mean, and asymptotic variance given by the Dirichlet energy of the bounded harmonic extension of the test function outside of the arc.
  A key tool in our analysis is the arc-Grunsky operator $B$ associated to $\gamma$, reminiscent to but different from the classical Grunsky operator. We derive several basic properties the arc-Grunsky operator, including an estimate analogous to the strengthened Grunsky inequality and the relation to the Dirichlet integral. In our proofs $J^A(\gamma)$ arises from the Fredholm determinant $\det(I+B)$ and a substantial part of the paper is devoted to relating this to the Loewner energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed description for the asymptotics of exponential functionals of random walks with light/heavy tails. We give the convergence rate based on the key observation that the asymptotics depends on the sample paths with either slowly decreasing local minimum or final value below a low level. Also, our thoughtful analysis of the interrelationship between the local minimum and the final value provides the exact expression for the limiting coefficients in terms of some transformations of the random walk.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves the convergence of the narrow wedge solutions of the KPZ equation to the Airy sheet and the directed landscape in the locally uniform topology. This is the first convergence result to the Airy sheet and the directed landscape established for a positive temperature model. We also give an independent proof for the convergence of the KPZ equation to the KPZ fixed point for general initial conditions in the locally uniform topology. Together with the directed landscape convergence, we show the joint convergence to the KPZ fixed point for multiple initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate possible large deviation principles (LDPs) for the $n$-vertex sampling from a given graphon with various speeds $s(n)$ and resolve all the cases except when the speed $s(n)$ is of order $n^2$.
  For quadratic speed $s=(c+o(1))n^2$, we establish an LDP for an arbitrary $k$-step graphon, which extends a result of Chatterjee and Varadhan [Europ. J. Combin., 32 (2011) 1000-1017] who did this for $k=1$ (that is, for the homogeneous binomial random graphs). This is done by reducing the problem to the LDP for stochastic $k$-block models established recently by Borgs, Chayes, Gaudio, Petti and Sen ["A large deviation principle for block models", arxiv:2007.14508, 2020]. Also, we improve some results by Borgs et al.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics of lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Langevin dynamics of various lattice formulations of the Yang--Mills--Higgs model, with an inverse Yang--Mills coupling $\beta$ and a Higgs parameter $\kappa$. The Higgs component is either a bounded field taking values in a compact target space, or an unbounded field taking values in a vector space in which case the model also has a Higgs mass parameter $m$. We study the regime where $(\beta,\kappa)$ are small in the first case or $(\beta,\kappa/m)$ are small in the second case. We prove the exponential ergodicity of the dynamics on the whole lattice via functional inequalities. We establish exponential decay of correlations for a broad class of observables, namely, the infinite volume measure exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Moreover, when the target space of the Higgs field is compact, appropriately rescaled observables exhibit factorized correlations in the large $N$ limit. These extend the earlier results \cite{SZZ22} on pure lattice Yang--Mills to the case with a coupled Higgs field.
  Unlike pure lattice Yang--Mills where the field is always bounded, in the case where the coupled Higgs component is unbounded, the control of its behavior is much harder and requires new techniques. Our approach involves a disintegration argument and a delicate analysis of correlations to effectively control the unbounded Higgs component.</description>

      <title>Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 2: the general time scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <title>Interface fluctuations for $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the interface fluctuation problem for the $1$D Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by a small space-time white noise. We show that if the initial data is a standing wave solution to the deterministic equation, then under proper long time scale, the solution is still close to the family of traveling wave solutions. Furthermore, the motion of the interface converges to an explicit stochastic differential equation. This extends the classical result in \cite{Fun95} to full small noise regime, and recovers the result in \cite{BBDMP98}.
  The proof builds on the analytic framework in \cite{Fun95}. Our main novelty is the construction of a series of functional correctors that are designed to recursively cancel potential divergences. Moreover, to show these correctors are well-behaved, we develop a systematic decomposition of Fr\'echet derivatives of the deterministic Allen-Cahn flow of all orders. This decomposition is of its own interest, and may be useful in other situations as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue distribution and resolvent of a Kronecker-product random matrix model $A \otimes I_{n \times n}+I_{n \times n} \otimes B+\Theta \otimes \Xi \in \mathbb{C}^{n^2 \times n^2}$, where $A,B$ are independent Wigner matrices and $\Theta,\Xi$ are deterministic and diagonal. For fixed spectral arguments, we establish a quantitative approximation for the Stieltjes transform by that of an approximating free operator, and a diagonal deterministic equivalent approximation for the resolvent. We further obtain sharp estimates in operator norm for the $n \times n$ resolvent blocks, and show that off-diagonal resolvent entries fall on two differing scales of $n^{-1/2}$ and $n^{-1}$ depending on their locations in the Kronecker structure.
  Our study is motivated by consideration of a matrix-valued least-squares optimization problem $\min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}} \frac{1}{2}\|XA+BX\|_F^2+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} \xi_i\theta_j x_{ij}^2$ subject to a linear constraint. For random instances of this problem defined by Wigner inputs $A,B$, our analyses imply an asymptotic characterization of the minimizer $X$ and its associated minimum objective value as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Mixing of metastable diffusion processes with Gibbs invariant distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the mixing properties of metastable diffusion processes which possess a Gibbs invariant distribution. For systems with multiple stable equilibria, so-called metastable transitions between these equilibria are required for mixing since the unique invariant distribution is concentrated on these equilibria. Consequently, these systems exhibit slower mixing compared to those with a unique stable equilibrium, as analyzed in Barrera and Jara (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30:1164--1208, 2020). Our proof is based on the theory of metastability, which is a primary tool for studying systems with multiple stable equilibria. Within this framework, we compute the total variation distance between the distribution of the diffusion process and its invariant distribution for any time scale larger than $\epsilon^{-1}$. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for the mixing time.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous elections in a polarized society make single-party sweeps more likely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a country with many elections, it may prove economically expedient to hold multiple elections simultaneously on a common polling date. We show that in a polarized society, in which each voter has a preferred party, an increase in the simultaneity of polling will increase the likelihood of a single-party sweep, namely, it will become more likely that a single party wins all the elections.
  In fact we show that the sweep probability goes up for \emph{every} party. Thus the phenomenon we describe is independent of the ``coattail'' or ``down-ballot'' effect of a popular leader. It is a \emph{systemic} and \emph{persistent} macroscopic political change, effected by a combination of political polarization and simultaneity of polling.
  Our result holds under fairly general conditions and is applicable to many common real-world electoral systems, including \emph{first-past-the-post} (most voters) and \emph{party list proportional representation} (most countries). In the course of our proof, we obtain a generalization of the well-known Harris correlation inequality.</description>

Abstract: We analyze asymptotic height function fluctuations in uniformly random domino tiling models on multiply connected Temperleyan domains. Starting from asymptotic formulas derived by Kenyon [arXiv:math-ph/9910002v1], we show that (1) the difference of the centered height function and a harmonic function with boundary values given by the (random) centered hole heights converges in the sense of moments to a Gaussian free field, which is independent of the hole heights, and (2) the hole heights themselves converge in distribution to a discrete Gaussian random vector. These results confirm general predictions about height fluctuations for tilings on multiply connected domains.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study higher-order derivatives of first-passage percolation with respect to the environment. One of our main results is a generalization of the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm-Talagrand variance bound, expressed in terms of the $L^2$-norms of these higher-order derivatives. We analyze the structure of these derivatives and compile a collection of related results. Several of these are sufficiently elementary to allow the use of algorithms and computer programs that automatically generate proofs of inequalities that would otherwise be intractable by manual methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variance in first-passage percolation can be bounded in terms of the $L^2$-norms of derivatives with respect to the environment. The study of higher-order derivatives in this context is still in its early stages, and only a few results are currently known. In this work, we prove that $-2$ is the optimal lower bound for the fourth-order derivative. To establish this result, we develop an algorithm and implement a computer program that constructs a rigorous mathematical proof of the inequality.</description>

      <title>Local central limit theorem for triangle counts in sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_H$ be the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ in $G(n,p)$. In 2016, Gilmer and Kopparty conjectured that a local central limit theorem should hold for $X_H$ as long as $H$ is connected, $p\gg n^{-1/m(H)}$ and $n^2(1-p)\gg 1$, where $m(H)$ denotes the $m$-density of $H$. Recently, Sah and Sawhney showed that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for constant $p$. In this paper, we show that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for triangle counts in the sparse range. More precisely, if $p \in (4n^{-1/2}, 1/2)$, then $$\sup_{x\in \mathcal{L}}\left| \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}-\sigma\cdot \mathbb{P}(X^* = x)\right|=n^{-1/2+o(1)}p^{1/2},$$ where $\sigma^2 = \mathbb{V}\text{ar}(X_{K_3})$, $X^{*}=(X_{K_3}-\mathbb{E}(X_{K_3}))/\sigma$ and $\mathcal{L}$ is the support of $X^*$. By combining our result with the results of R\"ollin--Ross and Gilmer--Kopparty, this establishes the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture for triangle counts for $n^{-1}\ll p &lt; c$, for any constant $c\in (0,1)$. Our quantitative result is enough to prove that the triangle counts converge to an associated normal distribution also in the $\ell_1$-distance. This is the first local central limit theorem for subgraph counts above the so-called $m_2$-density threshold.</description>

      <title>Sampling and estimation on manifolds using the Langevin diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error bounds are derived for sampling and estimation using a discretization of an intrinsically defined Langevin diffusion with invariant measure $\text{d}\mu_\phi \propto e^{-\phi} \mathrm{dvol}_g $ on a compact Riemannian manifold. Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Random Chowla's Conjecture for Rademacher Multiplicative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of partial sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions $(f(n))_n$ evaluated at polynomial arguments. We show that for a polynomial $P\in \mathbb Z[x]$ that is a product of at least two distinct linear factors or an irreducible quadratic satisfying a natural condition, there exists a constant $\kappa_P&gt;0$ such that
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa_P N}}\sum_{n\leq N}f(P(n))\xrightarrow{d}\mathcal{N}(0,1),
  \]
  as $N\rightarrow\infty$, where convergence is in distribution to a standard (real) Gaussian. This confirms a conjecture of Najnudel and addresses a question of Klurman-Shkredov-Xu.
  We also study large fluctuations of $\sum_{n\leq N}f(n^2+1)$ and show that there almost surely exist arbitrarily large values of $N$ such that \[ \Big|\sum_{n\leq N}f(n^2+1)\Big|\gg \sqrt{N \log\log N}. \] This matches the bound one expects from the law of iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>

      <title>Median Based Unit Weibull Distribution (MBUW): Does the Higher Order Probability Weighted Moments (PWM) Add More Information over the Lower Order PWM in Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, Probability weighted moments (PWMs) method for parameter estimation of the median based unit weibull (MBUW) distribution is discussed. The most widely used first order PWMs is compared with the higher order PWMs for parameter estimation of (MBUW) distribution. Asymptotic distribution of this PWM estimator is derived. This comparison is illustrated using real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantization for a condensation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>
