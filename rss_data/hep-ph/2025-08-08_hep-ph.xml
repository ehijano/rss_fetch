      <title>T versus CP effects in DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time reversal (T) symmetry violations in neutrino oscillations imply the presence of an $L$-odd component in the transition probability at fixed neutrino energy, with $L$ denoting the distance between neutrino source and detector. Within the standard three-flavour framework, we show that the combination of the transition probabilities determined at the DUNE and T2HK experiments can establish the presence of an $L$-odd component, and therefore provide sensitivity to T violation, up to $4\sigma$ significance. The optimal neutrino energy window is from 0.68 to 0.92 GeV, and therefore a crucial role is played by the low-energy part of the DUNE event spectrum covering the second oscillation maximum. We compare the sensitivity to T violation based on this energy range using neutrino data only with the more traditional search for charge-parity (CP) violation based on the comparison of neutrino versus anti-neutrino beam data. We show that for DUNE it is advantageous to run in neutrino mode only, i.e., searching for T violating effects, whereas T2HK is more sensitive to CP violation, comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino data. Hence, the two experiments offer complementary methods to determine the complex phase in the PMNS mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Inelastically Decoupling Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new dark matter candidate, the `inELastically DEcoupling Relic' (iELDER), which is a cold thermal relic whose abundance is determined by the freeze out of its inelastic scattering off of bath particles in the presence of $3\to2$ self-annihilations. The dark matter is predicted to be light, in the $O(\mathrm{MeV}-\mathrm{GeV})$ range, with significant self-annihilations and very weak inelastic couplings to ordinary matter. We demonstrate iELDER dark matter using a $Z_3$-symmetric toy model as well as QCD-like pion theories-the latter showing promising prospects for detection and providing a new benchmark for future searches.</description>

      <title>Detecting the $\pi$-axiverse through parametric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are a leading dark matter candidate. In this work, we study the detectability of a multi-axion-like model, dubbed the $\pi$-axiverse, that is distinguishable from the string axiverse. The dark matter candidates are $N^2-1$ pseudo-Nambu-Goto modes (pion- and kaon-like states) stemming from spontaneous breaking of a global $SU(N)$ flavor symmetry. The low energy theory includes $N-1$ axionic couplings with additional couplings to the Standard Model photon kinetic energy, reminiscent of the string theory dilaton-photon coupling. We explore the parametric resonance of photons interacting with such a dark sector. Axions are well known to form macroscopic solitonic-like objects (axion stars), which experience instabilities due to overdensities stemming from mergers or accretion processes. The instabilities produce high-intensity bursts of radiation via parametric resonance that may be detected at observatories such as MeerKAT, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). Using numerical methods, we systematically explore the multi-dimensional parameter space of the $\pi$-axiverse to search for regions where such signals are detectable, which generically differ from single axion models. We identify regions of the parameter space where MeerKAT, SKA, and ngVLA can resolve such signals, assessing the potential of transient searches to constrain the model. Our results provide a significant step forward in understanding the phenomenology and indirect detection of multi-axion-dilaton dark matter.</description>

      <title>Minicharged Particle Sensitivity of the MAPP Outrigger Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the projected background-free sensitivity of the MAPP Outrigger Detector (OD) to minicharged particles (mCPs) at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). As the first upgrade to the MAPP Experiment, the MAPP OD is a standalone detector designed to offer enhanced sensitivity to high-mass mCPs with intermediate effective charges. The MAPP OD is planned for installation in a duct adjacent to the MAPP-1 detector, located between the LHC's UA83 gallery and the beamline. Considering mCP production via the Drell-Yan mechanism and various meson decays, the results show that, at the 95% confidence level, the MAPP OD can extend the experiment's upper mass reach to mCP masses of approximately 200 GeV at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Quark confinement in presence of both chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields and the structure of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong interaction between quarks inside hadrons in curved spacetime is investigated in the presence of a new non-abelian gauge potential based on the $SU(3)$ group. This potential presented both chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields, including a magnetic monopole-like term, together with a radial non-Abelian Coulomb-like component. A spacetime metric induced by the presence of a Yang-Mills field is derived by solving Einstein's equations in the specific limit where the $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry is reduced to an embedded $SU(2)$ subgroup, accompanied by a dynamical $U(1)$ monopole sector. It is explicitly shown that the Schwarzschild radius of the strong interaction between quarks within hadrons corresponds approximately to the size of these latter and that the corresponding, for both quarks and gluons, wave function presents a discontinuity at Schwarzschild surface. The obtained results allow us to interpret the confinement of quarks as a geometric property of spacetime, emerging naturally from its structure without introducing any confinement potential. Moreover, the energy spectra of quarks in presence of chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields reproduce the mass of hadrons with a very good accuracy compared to the experimental data, and the presence of the residual non-abelian term correction enhance our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Dark Gauge Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore gravitational-wave (GW) signatures from a strong first-order phase transition in a non-Abelian dark sector, which naturally gives rise to vector dark matter. We consider a general class of models featuring a new dark gauge sector communicating with the Standard Model (SM) through a Higgs portal and a vector-like fermionic portal. We also study the scenario where the dark sector interacts with the SM only via gravity. In all cases, we scan the full parameter space and analyse GW production, highlighting that secluded dark sectors, with excessive dark radiation, fail to produce a LISA-observable GW background. Notably, the fermionic portal yields distinctive GW signals at LISA with peak frequencies of 1-10 mHz, reaching up to 1 Hz for future interferometers like BBO and DECIGO, while the Higgs portal scenario remains limited to around 1 mHz. Both frameworks account for the observed dark matter abundance and predict detectable LISA signals for dark vector bosons near 3-4 TeV (Higgs portal) and 10 TeV (fermionic portal), with a $\sim$10 GeV dark Higgs. Finally, we identify a unique six-top final state from pair-produced vector-like fermions, offering a striking collider signature within HL-LHC reach. Its detection would provide a smoking-gun signal for the fermionic portal, establishing complementarity between collider, GW, and dark matter signals.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering the Standard Model with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether artificial intelligence can autonomously recover known structures of the Standard Model of particle physics using only experimental data and without theoretical inputs. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques -- including data dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms -- to intrinsic particle properties and decay modes, we uncover key organizational features of particle physics, such as the relative strength of different interactions and the difference between baryons and mesons. We also identify conserved quantities such as baryon number, strangeness and charm as well as the structure of isospin and the Eightfold Way multiplets. Our analysis then reveals that clustering can separate particles by interaction, flavor symmetries as well as quantum numbers. Additionally, we observe patterns consistent with Regge trajectories in baryon excitations. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can reproduce key aspects of the Standard Model directly from data, suggesting a promising path toward data-driven discovery in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic modifications to the transport phenomena and observables in a hot QCD medium at finite baryon asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied how the transport of charge and heat as well as associated observables become influenced by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising due to the asymptotic expansion of baryon asymmetric matter in the initial stages of heavy ion collisions. This study facilitates the understanding of the local equilibrium property of the medium through the Knudsen number, and explores the correlation between the heat flow and the charge flow through the Lorenz number in the Wiedemann-Franz law for an anisotropic hot QCD medium at finite baryon asymmetry. We have determined the electrical and the thermal conductivities by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. The interactions among partons are appended through the particle distribution functions within the quasiparticle model of the hot QCD medium at finite temperature, anisotropy and baryon asymmetry. We have observed a decrease in both electrical and thermal conductivities in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy for baryonless scenario as well as for baryon asymmetric scenario. Conversely, these conductivities are found to be larger in the baryon asymmetric matter as compared to their counterparts in the baryonless matter. The impact of anisotropy on the baryon asymmetric matter is as conspicuous as on the baryonless matter. The above results are attributed to the squeezing of the distribution function due to the momentum anisotropy generated by the asymptotic expansion of baryon asymmetric matter and the dispersion relations of partons in the presence of anisotropy. Additionally, the aforesaid observables are also modulated by the expansion-induced anisotropy in the baryon asymmetric medium, indicating new predictions for the equilibrium characteristic and the relative behavior between the heat and charge flow for the said medium.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decay $D^+\to\pi^+\eta\eta$ and the $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(1370)$ contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the resent BESIII Collaboration measurements of the process $D^+\to\pi^+\eta\eta$, we investigate this process by considering the contribution from the resonance $a_0(980)$, which is generated by $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interaction, and the contribution from the intermediate scalar meson $f_0(1370)$. Our results could give a good description of the $\pi^+\eta$ and $\eta\eta$ invariant mass distributions, which implies that the contribution from the intermediate $f_0(1370)$, neglected in BESIII analysis, could play a role in this process. Furthermore, the predicted Dalitz plots are also consistent with the BESIII measurements. The more precise measurements about this process in future could shed light on the mechanism of this process and the properties of $f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(980)$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetric Dark Matter from Neutron Star Capture and Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a conserved particle$-$antiparticle number, $n_\chi-n_{\tilde \chi}$, and the asymmetry in the cosmological abundance $n_\chi\neq n_{\tilde \chi}$, are known to be challenged by the existence of old neutron stars (NSs), as the sufficient accumulation of DM will lead to the collapse of NSs into black holes. We demonstrate that the applicability of these constraints is much wider and covers models with symmetric populations of DM, $n_\chi = n_{\tilde \chi}$, as the process of DM capture regulated by a nucleon-DM scattering can be inherently asymmetric, $\sigma_{\chi n}\neq \sigma_{\tilde\chi n}$. The asymmetry is induced by the interference of different types of $\chi$-$n$ interactions, provided that their combination is odd under charge conjugation in the DM sector, $C_\chi$, and even under combined parity $P_{\chi + n}$. We provide a complete analysis of DM-nucleon bilinear $\chi$-$n$ interactions and find that this asymmetry is very generic. Using canonical NS parameters and local DM halo inputs, we exclude spin-averaged scattering cross sections down to $\sigma_{n\chi}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-46}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$ at DM mass $m_\chi\!\lesssim\!10^{10}\,{\rm GeV}$ for the maximally asymmetric capture rate, and show that the constraints persist down to very small values of the cross-section asymmetry, ${\cal A}=(\sigma_{\chi n}- \sigma_{\tilde\chi n})/(\sigma_{\chi n}+ \sigma_{\tilde\chi n})\gtrsim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Type-III Seesaw in Non-Holomorphic Modular Symmetry and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Qu and Ding, have proposed a formalism where modular invariance is extended to non-supersymmetric scenario considering Yukawa couplings as non-holomorphic functions of modules field $\tau$. Adopting this formalism in this work, we propose a Type-III seesaw model as a unified framework to explain lepton masses and mixing and baryogenesis via leptogenesis. $\chi^2$ analysis is performed to fit the neutrino oscillation data from NuFIT~6.0 leading to a normal hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses and constrained $CP$ phases. Furthermore, we analyze the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via thermal leptogenesis where the decays of the lightest fermion triplet $\Sigma_1$ into lepton-Higgs final states produce a $CP$ asymmetry $\varepsilon_{CP}$. The complex modules $\tau$ is responsible for the $CP$ asymmetry produced during leptogenesis. The washout processes dominated by gauge scatterings and inverse decays are studied through the full set of Boltzmann equations. The resulting $B-L$ asymmetry, $Y_{B-L}\sim 10^{-9}$ successfully reproduces the baryon-to-photon ratio demonstrating the model's capability to link low-energy neutrino data with the baryogenesis. The strong gauge-mediated washout of fermion triplets necessitates a leptogenesis scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV})$ ensuring compatibility with both the Davidson-Ibarra bound and the thermal history of the Universe. Future pursuits remain open to the exploration of novel avenues aimed at lowering the energy scale associated with leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The sixth order QED radiative corrections to lepton anomalies due to the fourth order vacuum polarization insertions within the Mellin-Barnes representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit form of the sixth order radiative corrections to the lepton $L$ ($L=e, ~\mu $ and $\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment from QED Feynman diagrams with insertion of the fourth-order polarization operators consisting of either two closed lepton loops or one lepton loop crossed by a photon line is discussed in detail. The approach is based on the consistent application of dispersion relations for vacuum polarization operators and the Mellin-Barnes transform for massive photon propagators. Explicit analytical expressions for corrections to the lepton anomaly are obtained for the first time in the whole interval $0 &lt;r&lt; \infty $ of the ratio $r$ of lepton masses $m_\ell/m_L$. Asymptotic expansions in the limit of both small $r\ll 1$ and large $r\gg 1$ computed from the exact expressions are found to be in perfect agreement with the ones earlier reported in the literature. We argue that in the region wherethe physical lepton mass ratios are located, the asymptotic expansions hold with an accuracy higher than the experimentally measured anomalies. The two loop diagrams with all three leptons different from each other are computed numerically and compared with the corresponding corrections from the pure two-bubble and one-bubble mixed diagrams. It is shown that there are regions of ratios $r$ where all three types of the fourth order polarization operator contribute equally to the anomaly.</description>

      <title>Probing lepton flavor violating dark matter scenarios via astrophysical photons and positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we explore, for the first time, the constraints on lepton flavor violating (LFV) dark matter (DM) scenarios via the astrophysical photons and positrons, including both the annihilation and decay modes, ${\tt DM(+DM)}\to e^\pm \mu^\mp, e^\pm \tau^\mp, \mu^\pm \tau^\mp$. Given the presence of LFV interactions in various DM models and the challenge of probing such interactions at terrestrial facilities, such as DM direct detection and collider experiments, indirect detection offers a unique approach to investigating them. We utilize the currently available photon datasets from the XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, and Fermi-LAT telescopes, along with the positron datasets from the AMS-02 satellite, to establish stringent bounds on the relevant annihilation cross sections or decay widths. In particular, we include contributions to the photon spectrum from final state radiation, radiative decays, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that the INTEGRAL (AMS-02) provides the most stringent bound on the annihilation cross sections and decay widths for DM mass below (above) approximately 20 GeV, which are comparable to those of their lepton flavor conserving counterparts.</description>

      <title>An analysis of nuclear parton distribution function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an attempt to quantify the difference between nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) in different nuclei and parton distribution functions (PDFs) in free nucleons using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure widely employed in quantum information theory. By introducing certain constraints and the ``minimum relative entropy'' hypothesis, we can determine the shape of the structure function in the intermediate-$x$ region, which is intimately connected with the renowned EMC effect. The obtained results are consistent with the latest global fits of experimental data. Moreover, we have extended this methodology to the determination of the gluon nPDFs, achieving results that exhibit remarkable consistency with global QCD fits. These results indicate that KL divergence may offer us a new window and perspective on the structure and nature of nucleons -- particularly in cases where limited experimental and theoretical QCD constraints are available.</description>

      <title>Bottom baryon decays into light meson and dark baryon within perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work, we study the production of dark baryon $\psi$ with the bottom-baryon decays $\Lambda_b\to M \psi$ under the perturbative QCD approach. For the Type-I/II models in B-Mesogenesis scenarios, we calculate the form factors for bottom-baryon decays into meson. Using these results, we obtain branching ratios for $\Lambda_b\to M \psi$ decays. The PQCD approach calculations show these branching ratios reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ in both models, with $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b\to K\psi)$ specifically reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ in Type-II. These accessible magnitudes make the predictions testable at the LHCb and B-factories with improved precision.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the fragmentation function of gluon at next-to-leading order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are investigating the behavior of the fragmentation function of a gluon, denoted as $ D_{g}(x,\mu^2)$, where $\mu$ represents the observable scale. This function is derived from the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations. Our objective is to evolve the fragmentation function of a gluon for heavy-quark-antiquark bound states with large transverse momentum using a Laplace transform technique. This method enables us to calculate numerical solutions for two and four quarkonium states based on the known initial fragmentation function of gluons. We examine both leading-order (LO) and higher-order approximations for the fragmentation function of a gluon, $[g{\rightarrow}T_{nQ}]$, by integrating the evolved fragmentation function of the gluon at the initial scale. In our computations, we utilize the initial scales for $T^{2c}_{g}$ from Braaten-Yuan [E.Braaten and T.C.Yuan, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf71}, 1673 (1993)] and for $T^{4c}_{g}$ and $T^{4b}_{g}$ from Celiberto-Gatto-papa [ F. G. Celiberto, G. Gatto and A. Papa, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf84}, 1071 (2024)] and Celiberto-Gatto [ F. G. Celiberto and G. Gatto, Phys. Rev. D {\bf111}, 034037 (2025)] respectively. Through comparing our predictions with existing literature results, we can accurately determine the evolution of the fragmentation function of a gluon at scale $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Pseudorapidity dependence of charged particles production in non-single diffractive $pp$ collisions in the PACIAE 4.0 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying experimental observables is a key benchmark for validating theoretical models in high energy physics. In this work, we employ the PACIAE 4.0 model to simulate non-single diffractive proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV, comparing the results with Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experimental data on charged-particle pseudorapidity densities and transverse momentum spectra across different pseudorapidity bins, respectively. Our results show good agreement with the CMS data, particularly only using a single set of parameters for all collision energies. This demonstrates that the PACIAE 4.0 model can serve as a reliable tool for systematically studying the physics of NSD $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>An examination of the two-peak hypothesis of $P_{\Psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ using heavy quark symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration announcement regarding the observation of the $P_{\Psi s}^{\Lambda} (4459)$ stated that it might consist of two resonances rather than a single one. Naturally, the structure and composition of $P_{\Psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ state has prompted significant interest among researchers. Within the framework of generalized flavor-spin symmetry, the $P_{\Psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ has been correlated with the previously identified as one-peak states $P_c(4450)$, which were later found to be two-peak, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$. We investigate whether the $P_{\Psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ embodies one or two distinct resonances. Notably, one of the predicted peaks posited by LHCb analysis appears to correspond to a $\bar{D}^*\Xi_c$ molecular state.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2508.02747 a theory that unifies gravity and the Standard Model was proposed. It is finite, unitary, and accurately predicts all parameters of the Standard Model in terms of only two input parameters. Here I point out one prediction that was overlooked, namely that the photon acquires a mass at one loop due to the lack of gauge invariance in the nonlocal interaction vertices of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>A short review of the vector charmonium-like state $\psi(4230)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise review of the vector charmonium state $\psi(4230)$, which was originally labelled as $Y(4260)$ in the literature. As one of the earliest candidates for a QCD exotic states, its interpretation has initiated various ideas about possible manifestations of non-perturbative mechanisms in the charmonium mass regime. In this short article we briefly review the experimental status of $\psi(4230)$ and discuss possible theoretical interpretations. We will focus on four broadly investigated scenarios, i.e. tetraquark, hybrid, hadro-quarkonium, and hadronic molecule, and highlight the key issues based on these approaches. Crucial experimental observables, e.g. mass position, lineshapes, di-lepton decay width $\Gamma_{ee}$, production rates in $B$ meson decays, dominant hadronic decay patterns, and the potential $1^{-+}$ and $0^{--}$ exotic partners, are assessed, which can provide crucial structure information for understanding this mysterious state.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I review the determinations of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) and $\tau$-like moments in $e^+e^-\to I=1$ Hadrons and in $\tau\to \nu_\tau+$Hadrons Axial-vector (A) and V-A channels. Some misprints in the original papers [1-3] have been corrected. We found that the value of the gluon condensate agrees with the one $\langle \alpha_s G^2\rangle=(6.35\pm 0.35)\times 10^{-2}$ GeV$^4$ from quarkonia and some other sum rules but less accurate, while the factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor about 6: $\rho\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle^2=(5.98\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-4}$ GeV$^6$ which confirms previous findings. Extracting the QCD condensates up to dimension D=20 from $e^+e^-$ and the axial-vector channel of $\tau$-decay, we do not find any exponential growth of their values in the Euclidian region, thus excluding (by duality) any significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV) in the Time-like one. The optimal values of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons and $\tau$-decays agree each others and lead to the average: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3128(51)$ [resp.0.3330(57)] $ \longrightarrow \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1176$ [resp. 0.1201] $(7)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour improved (CI)] PT series to be compared with the PDG24 average (without Lattice calculations): $ \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1175(10)$.</description>

      <title>Partially flavour non-universal $U(1)$ and radiative fermion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Standard Model with a partially flavour non-universal abelian gauge symmetry that enables radiative mass generation for lighter fermions. With flavour-universal charges for the first two generations, gauge-induced loop corrections generate second-generation masses while keeping the first generation massless. Small first-generation masses can arise from subdominant scalar loops within this framework. A single anomaly-free $U(1)$ is sufficient for a realistic model, and the partial universality relaxes the gauge boson mass bound from several thousand TeV to about 200 TeV compared with previous frameworks of this type. We also identify an alignment limit matching the lightest scalar to the observed Higgs and compute its couplings with the fermions, which largely agree with Standard Model values but show testable deviations.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections and wavefunction renormalization for atoms, nuclei, and other heavy composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-loop QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where we identify a number of effects that arise at one loop that are, to the best of our knowledge, not included in current extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. In particular we find an electromagnetic isospin breaking correction at $O(\alpha)$ in addition to the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ corrections from the intranuclear Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.</description>

      <title>Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Scalar and spinor fields in gravitating cosmic string spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering behavior of scalar and spinor fields in the background of a gravitating cosmic string spacetime. The model explored here for the background vortex is non-abelian, becoming abelian in an appropriate limiting case. We adopted the formalism we developed in \cite{silva2021scattering}, modifying the standard partial wave approach. We apply the method for a scalar and also a fermion field interacting with the background spacetime with a nontrivial asymptotic structure. The spacetime metric, obtained numerically in \cite{de2015gravitating}, forms the basis of our state-of-the-art numerical study. We make an exhaustive analysis and compare all the results in the non-abelian model with the corresponding abelian one for both massless and massive fields. We analyze the field configuration's total cross-section and angular profile at small and large distances from the core. We show that the total cross-section oscillates with the incident momentum of the wave, as anticipated in \cite{silva2021scattering}, and also, the angular profile can be explained reasonably well with a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, especially for the scalar field scattering.</description>

      <title>Acausality-driven instabilities in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-linear instabilities stemming from superluminal propagation of information in relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. In relativity, the characteristic speed of propagation of information, $w$, and the speed of the fluid, $v$, allow us to differentiate between regimes of the hydrodynamic equations that are acausal but stable ($w&gt;1$), unstable ($v^{2} w^{2} \geq 1$), and covariantly ill-posed ($w^{2} \leq 0$). As an analytical benchmark, we present a new solution that illustrates these distinct regimes. We compare this analytical solution to the result of a numerical relativistic viscous fluid dynamics solver, and confirm that the analytical result can be recovered numerically in the stable regime, whether causal or acausal. The onset of numerical instabilities is further found to occur in the regime predicted by the analytical solution.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $N-J/\psi$ Interaction from an Operator Product Expansion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent lattice QCD study has shown that the $N-J/\psi$ potential is attractive at all distances, and its long-range tail is well described by two-pion exchange. Here, we study to what extent the long-range part of the attraction can be reproduced from the perspective of the operator product expansion (OPE). This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of four-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter on the masses of the $J/\psi$ and other mesons composed of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of the entropy and heat capacity for pp collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum spectrum of the charged particle production in pp collisions at LHC energies. To this end, we consider the experimental data sets classified with different multiplicity estimators, defined by the ALICE Collaboration, that are analyzed within the framework of nonextensive particle production. We compute the variance, kurtosis, Shannon entropy, and heat capacity of the $p_T$ spectrum to study the hardening process as a function of the multiplicity and temperature under the different event classifiers. We found that both the Shannon entropy and the heat capacity show different responses for the triggers at the forward-backward and midrapidity regions. We emphasize that the selection of event biases may induce different responses in estimating theoretical and phenomenological observables that could lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Probing surface vibration of spherical nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been increasing interest in recent years in using relativistic heavy-ion collisions to probe nuclear structure, such as static nuclear deformation. Here we discuss the role of quantum zero-point fluctuations of the surface vibration of spherical nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we employ an approach to describe the vibration in the space-fixed frame, which has been well established in the field of low-energy heavy-ion fusion reactions. We particularly consider the quadrupole vibration of $^{58}$Ni in $^{58}$Ni+$^{58}$Ni reaction and the octupole vibration of $^{208}$Pb in $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb reaction. We show that the surface vibration leads to comparable eccentricity parameters to those for static deformation, while they give significantly different distributions of the initial states, suggesting the importance of the proper treatment of the surface vibration in heavy-ion collisions. We perform similar analysis also for triaxial deformation and gamma-soft vibration.</description>

      <title>A Resummed Hydrodynamic Description of Relativistic Heavy-ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a resummed hydrodynamic scheme for evolving the viscous stress tensors in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, based on which the necessary non-linear causality conditions can be imposed. When the magnitudes of the shear and bulk viscous stress tensors are small relative to the ideal part energy-momentum tensor, this new resummed scheme reduces to the standard second-order relativistic hydrodynamic theories. Nontrivial nonlinear corrections from high-order gradient terms retain the sizes of shear and bulk viscous stress tensors within tunable maximum allowed values. We perform event-by-event simulations for Pb+Pb and p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV to quantify the theoretical uncertainties from this resummed scheme on final-state flow observables.</description>

      <title>Mode-by-mode evolution of Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV in a hybrid model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the average state and the uncorrelated modes that characterize the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial state in two typical centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. We find that modes in a narrow central bin are similar to those in events at fixed vanishing impact parameter, while those in a mid-peripheral centrality class are affected by the impact-parameter variation. We study how each fluctuation mode affects observables both in the initial state and in the final state of the collisions, at the end of a state-of-the-art boost-invariant hybrid evolution with KoMPoST + MUSIC + iSS + SMASH, and show that implementing a hadronic transport cascade in such a mode-by-mode analysis with reasonable statistical noise is costly but feasible.</description>

      <title>Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of meson masses and low-energy constants in large-$N$ QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$, the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling $\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$ results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion-Like Particles with Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future gamma-ray experiments, such as the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO telescopes, can detect the Hawking radiation of photons from primordial black holes (PBHs) if they make up a fraction or all of dark matter. PBHs can analogously also Hawking radiate new particles, which is especially interesting if these particles are mostly secluded from the Standard Model (SM) sector, since they might therefore be less accessible otherwise. A well-motivated example of this type is axion-like particles (ALPs) with a tiny coupling to photons. We assume that the ALPs produced by PBHs decay into photons well before reaching the earth, so these will augment the photons directly radiated by the PBHs. Remarkably, we find that the peaks in the energy distributions of ALPs produced from PBHs are different than the corresponding ones for Hawking radiated photons due to the spin-dependent greybody factor. Therefore, we demonstrate that this process will in fact distinctively modify the PBHs' gamma-ray spectrum relative to the SM prediction. We use monochromatic asteroid-mass PBHs as an example to show that e-ASTROGAM can observe the PBH-produced ALP gamma-ray signal (for masses up to ~60 MeV) and further distinguish it from Hawking radiation without ALPs. By measuring the gamma-ray signals, e-ASTROGAM can thereby probe yet unexplored parameters in the ALP mass and photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Third-Family Quark-Lepton Unification and Electroweak Precision Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the compatibility of the hypothesis of third-family quark-lepton unification at the TeV scale with electroweak precision data, lepton flavor universality tests, and high-$p_T$ constraints. We work within the framework of the UV complete flavor non-universal 4321 gauge model, which is matched at one loop to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. For consistency, all electroweak precision observables are also computed at one loop within the effective field theory. At tree level, the most sizeable corrections are to $W\rightarrow \tau\nu_\tau$ and $Z \to \nu_\tau \nu_\tau$ due to integrating out a pseudo-Dirac singlet fermion required by the model for neutrino mass generation. At loop level, the new colored states of the model generate large flavor-universal contributions to the electroweak precision observables via leading- and next-to-leading log running effects, yielding a significant improvement in the electroweak fit (including an increase in the $W$-boson mass). These effects cannot be decoupled if the model addresses the charged-current $B$-meson anomalies. Overall, we find good compatibility between the data sets, while simultaneously satisfying all low- and high-energy constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the CMS Open Data to examine the performance of weakly-supervised learning for tagging quark and gluon jets at the LHC. We target $Z$+jet and dijet events as respective quark- and gluon-enriched mixtures and derive samples both from data taken in 2011 at 7 TeV, and from Monte Carlo. CWoLa and TopicFlow models are trained on real data and compared to fully-supervised classifiers trained on simulation. In order to obtain estimates for the discrimination power in real data, we consider three different estimates of the quark/gluon mixture fractions in the data. Compared to when the models are evaluated on simulation, we find reversed rankings for the fully- and weakly-supervised approaches. Further, these rankings based on data are robust to the estimate of the mixture fraction in the test set. Finally, we use TopicFlow to smooth statistical fluctuations in the small testing set, and to provide uncertainty on the performance in real data.</description>

Abstract: Mirror dark matter, a hidden-sector counterpart to the Standard Model with identical particle content, could be detectable through photon-mirror-photon kinetic mixing $(\epsilon)$. We present new constraints from CDEX-10 low-energy recoil data, establishing $\epsilon &lt; 2 \times 10^{-10}$ for mirror nuclear dark matter in the 10--56 GeV mass range. Projections for CDEX-300 (with 95 days of exposure) show significantly improved sensitivity, reaching $\epsilon &lt; 3.75 \times 10^{-11}$ for a local mirror halo temperature below 0.3 keV, surpassing existing constraints from LUX and positronium decays. These results demonstrate CDEX-300's unique capability to probe kinetic-mixing parameter space, providing stringent constraints on mirror dark matter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nickel oxide, which is already a very promising target to look for sub-MeV dark matter scattering, can be employed to hunt axion dark matter, with masses in the meV range and couplings to electrons allowing them to potentially be QCD axions. We describe the interactions between axions and the collective excitations of nickel oxide in terms of a universal effective field theory, built solely out of symmetry arguments. The processes of conversion into one or two excitations provide, respectively, a narrowband and a broadband channel for the axion search, and the possibility of varying an external magnetic field up to a phase transition point allows to cover a large portion of a yet unexplored parameter space, reaching axion masses down to few fractions of an meV. Our results underline nickel oxide as an ideal candidate for a multi-purpose target for light dark matter searches.</description>

Abstract: We study the phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) at the LHC in effective field theory, concentrating on $d=6$ operators with top quarks. Depending on the operator choice and HNL mass, the HNLs will be produced either from proton-proton collisions in association with a single top, or via non-standard decays of top quarks. For long-lived HNLs we estimate the sensitivity reach of different detectors to various operators with top quarks and the HNLs for the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. For certain operators, ATLAS and some far detectors (MATHUSLA and ANUBIS) will be able to probe the associated new-physics scale as large as 12 TeV and 4.5 TeV, respectively, covering complementary HNL-mass ranges.</description>

Abstract: We review the gauged quintessence scenario, wherein the quintessence scalar field responsible for dark energy is promoted to a complex field charged under a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. This construction leads to new and potentially rich cosmological phenomenology. After a concise recap of the standard quintessence scenario, we highlight how a $U(1)$ gauge invariance alters the dynamics of the scalar and the associated dark gauge boson. We survey the evolution of both fields across cosmic history, discuss their possible production via a misalignment mechanism, and examine implications for the Hubble tension. We also comment on potential non-gravitational signals of gauged quintessence through kinetic mixing (the dark photon vector portal).</description>

Abstract: Neutrino oscillation, discovered over two decades ago, confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero masses. Since then, two mass-squared differences have been measured with unprecedented precision, yet the absolute neutrino mass scale remains unknown. Additionally, the fundamental symmetry governing the neutrino mixing pattern is still undetermined. Among various theoretical possibilities, the two-zero texture in the neutrino mass matrix ($m_\nu$) stands out as an attractive framework due to its reduced number of free parameters, enabling definite predictions for the unknown parameters of the PMNS matrix. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the two-zero texture, focusing on its implications for the Dirac CP phase ($\delta$), the Majorana phases ($\rho$, $\sigma$) and the effective Majorana mass ($m_{\beta\beta}$), the latter being crucial for neutrinoless double beta decay. We find that for certain two-zero textures, $m_{\beta\beta}$ reaches a few tens of meV, placing it within the sensitivity range of KamLAND-Zen. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a two-zero texture can naturally emerge in a well-motivated neutrino mass model, specifically the gauged Type-II seesaw mechanism, which requires multiple scalar triplets. Notably, some of the two-zero patterns cannot be realized in this framework, as more than two independent zeros appear in $m_\nu$. Finally, we discuss key phenomenological consequences of the gauged Type-II seesaw model.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet model is an economical model of weakly interacting dark matter. We revisit it in light of improved dark matter direct detection limits. We characterize the now well-defined regions of remaining parameter space with suppressed direct detection cross sections and discuss features of the spectrum accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. We discuss when and how parameters in these special regions might be realized as the result of renormalization group evolution when starting with generic ultraviolet initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these proceedings, I present a composite Higgs model in which the flavour hierarchies between the third and light families emerge naturally. In particular, CKM mixing angles turn out to be suppressed while PMNS matrix remains anarchic. This flavour structure arises as a consequence of the extended non-universal gauge symmetry of the model and the electroweak charges of the fundamental fermions of the new composite sector that realises the Higgs boson as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. The model is described in detail in arXiv:2412.14243.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decay of true muonium: $\boldsymbol{(\mu^+ \mu^-) \to \mu^\pm e^\mp}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new channel for probing charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV): the decay of true muonium into a lepton pair of different flavor, $(\mu^+ \mu^-) \to \mu^\pm e^\mp$. This purely leptonic two-body decay provides a clean experimental signature in the form of energetic, oppositely charged leptons. It is sensitive not only to photonic dipole interactions but also to four-fermion contact interactions, and is free from hadronic uncertainties in theoretical predictions. We evaluate the branching ratios induced by scalar-, vector-, and dipole-type CLFV operators. Our results show that the branching ratio can reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ within current experimental bounds. This decay mode may be discovered as an early-stage physics opportunity of the muon collider program by utilizing the large number of muons produced at its front end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle-II experiment has recently reported the first measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$ decay which exceeds the Standard Model prediction by approximately 2.7$\sigma$. The deviation may indicate the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model in the $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$ sector. Under this assumption, we study the hadronic $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda(\to p\pi)\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda^\ast(\to N\!\bar{K})\nu\bar{\nu}$ decays within both the Standard Model and beyond. We work in a low energy effective field theory framework with additional light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate the differential branching ratios of these decay modes and explore the implications of the Belle-II results through various observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent study[1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for discriminating among various inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants, long-range correlations, and the antiproton puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze joint factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and point out that they obey the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$ as a function of acceptance when only long-range correlations are present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons, $-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 &gt; -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2$. Existing theoretical baselines, based on global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations, cannot explain the data, to which we refer as the antiproton puzzle. We also discuss high-order factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within phase II of RHIC-BES.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dark energy models using late-universe observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, dark energy was proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration. A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in constraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a comparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current data. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information criterion (AIC), deviance information criterion (DIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC and DIC analyses indicate that all dark energy models outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier penalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy models are robustly supported by AIC and DIC while being explicitly disfavored by BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and DIC and not explicitly disfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark energy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity model exhibits superior performance when compared with $\Lambda$CDM across all information criteria.</description>

      <title>Jet Quenching in Holographic QCD as an Indicator of Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the gauge/gravity duality to study jet quenching (JQ) phenomena in the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, we implement holographic QCD models constructed from an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity at finite temperature and finite chemical potential for light and heavy quarks. The models capture both the confinement and deconfinement phases of QCD and the first-order phase transitions. We calculate the JQ parameter in different models and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions studies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature $T$, chemical potential $\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for identifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\mu,c_B)$ parameter space of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ on the parameter $\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse anisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the dependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map critical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to earlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the gauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly coupled systems.</description>
