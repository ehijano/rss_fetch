      <title>Large cardinals beyond HOD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exacting and ultraexacting cardinals are large cardinal numbers compatible with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory, including the Axiom of Choice. In contrast with standard large cardinal notions, their existence implies that the set-theoretic universe V is not equal to G\"odel's subuniverse of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable (HOD) sets. We prove that the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal is equiconsistent with the well-known axiom I0; moreover, the existence of ultraexacting cardinals together with other standard large cardinals is equiconsistent with generalizations of I0 for fine-structural models of set theory extending $L(V_{\lambda+1})$. We prove tight bounds on the strength of exacting cardinals, placing them strictly between the axioms I3 and I2. The argument extends to show that I2 implies the consistency of Vop\v{e}nka's Principle together with an exacting cardinal and the HOD Hypothesis. In particular, we obtain the following result: the existence of an extendible cardinal above an exacting cardinal does not refute the HOD Hypothesis. We also give several new characterizations of exacting and ultraexacting cardinals; first in terms of strengthenings of the axioms I3 and I1 with the addition of Ordinal Definable predicates, and finally also in terms of principles of Structural Reflection which characterize exacting and ultraexacting cardinals as natural two-cardinal forms of strong unfoldability.</description>

      <title>A Fibonacci-Based G\"odel Numbering: $\Delta_0$ Semantics Without Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a more efficient G\"odel encoding scheme based on Zeckendorf representations of natural numbers, avoiding the use of unbounded exponentiation and without appealing to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The resulting encoding is injective, primitive recursive, and $\Delta_0$-definable in weak arithmetical theories such as $I\Delta_0 + \Omega_1$. This allows for the construction of fixed points and the formalization of incompleteness theorems entirely within bounded arithmetic. Compared to traditional prime-exponent $\Pi$ codings, the Zeckendorf approach yields longer codes but supports simpler substitution mechanisms and more transparent definability properties.</description>

      <title>A Note on Constructive Canonical Splitter Strategies in Nowhere Dense Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radius-$r$ splitter game is played on a graph $G$ between two players: Splitter and Connector. In each round, Connector selects a vertex $v$, and the current game arena is restricted to the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $v$. Then Splitter removes a vertex from this restricted subgraph. The game ends, and Splitter wins, when the arena becomes empty. Splitter aims to end the game as quickly as possible, while Connector tries to prolong it for as long as possible. The splitter game was introduced by Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz to characterize nowhere dense graph classes. They showed that a class $\mathscr{C}$ of graphs is nowhere dense if and only if for every radius $r$ there exists a number $\ell$ such that Splitter has a strategy on every $G\in \mathscr{C}$ to win the radius-$r$ splitter game in at most $\ell$ rounds. It was recently proved by Ohlmann et al. that there are only a bounded number of possible Splitter moves that are progressing, that is, moves that lead to an arena where Splitter can win in one less round. The proof of Ohlmann et al. is based on the compactness theorem and does not give a constructive bound on the number of progressing moves. In this work, we give a simple constructive proof, showing that if Splitter can force a win in the radius-$r$ game in $k$ rounds, then there are at most $(2r+1)^{\,2^{k-1}-1}$ progressing moves.</description>

      <title>Notes on the equiconsistency of ZFC without the Power Set axiom and second order PA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that theories $\text{Z}^-$, $\text{ZF}^-$, $\text{ZFC}^-$ (minus means the absence of the Power Set axiom) and $\text{PA}_2$, $\text{PA}_2^-$ (minus means the absence of the Countable Choice schema) are equiconsistent to each other. The methods used include the interpretation of a power-less set theory in $\text{PA}_2^-$ via well-founded trees, as well as the G\"odel constructibility in the said power-less set theory.</description>

      <title>Monoid Theory in Alonzo: A Little Theories Formalization in Simple Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alonzo is a practice-oriented classical higher-order version of predicate logic that extends first-order logic and that admits undefined expressions. Named in honor of Alonzo Church, Alonzo is based on Church's type theory, Church's formulation of simple type theory. The little theories method is a method for formalizing mathematical knowledge as a theory graph consisting of theories as nodes and theory morphisms as directed edges. The development of a mathematical topic is done in the "little theory" in the theory graph that has the most convenient level of abstraction and the most convenient vocabulary, and then the definitions and theorems produced in the development are transported, as needed, to other theories via the theory morphisms in the theory graph.
  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a body of mathematical knowledge can be formalized in Alonzo using the little theories method. This is done by formalizing monoid theory -- the body of mathematical knowledge about monoids -- in Alonzo. Instead of using the standard approach to formal mathematics in which mathematics is done with the help of a proof assistant and all details are formally proved and mechanically checked, we employ an alternative approach in which everything is done within a formal logic but proofs are not required to be fully formal. The standard approach focuses on certification, while this alternative approach focuses on communication and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Groups with infinite linearly ordered products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of infinite, linearly ordered products in general groups. Using this, we define infinite compositions in certain groups of formal power series such as transseries. We show that such groups can sometimes be represented as infinite, linearly ordered, semidirect products of ordered Abelian groups.</description>
