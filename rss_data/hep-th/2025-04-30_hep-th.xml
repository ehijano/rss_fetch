      <title>The evaporation of black holes in supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supergravity, charged rotating black holes are generically driven towards becoming extremal and supersymmetric through the emission of Hawking radiation. Eventually, as the black hole approaches the BPS bound and is close to becoming supersymmetric, quantum gravity corrections become critical to describing the emission of Hawking radiation, making the QFT in curved spacetime approximation inaccurate. In this paper, we compute how such quantum gravity corrections affect the spectrum of Hawking radiation for black holes in $\mathcal N=2$ supergravity in flatspace. We show that due to such corrections, the spectrum of emitted Hawking radiation for both spin-0 and spin-$1/2$ particles deviates drastically at low temperatures from the naively expected black-body spectrum. Rather remarkably, the spectrum exhibits a discrete emission line from direct transitions from near-BPS to BPS states, providing the first controlled example where the discreteness of the black hole energies is visible in the emitted Hawking radiation. Similar quantum gravity effects drastically modify the absorption cross-section: BPS black holes are transparent to certain frequencies, while near-BPS black holes appear much larger than the semi-classical prediction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, entanglement, and the $S$-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework connecting global symmetries to the relativistic $S$-matrix through the lens of quantum information theory. Analyzing the 2-to-2 scattering of particles of any helicity, we systematically characterize relativistic scattering amplitudes as quantum gates in the bipartite space of states with a discrete quantum number. This formalism naturally recovers and significantly extends previous results on entanglement suppression of the $S$-matrix, providing a comprehensive approach for studying the emergence of symmetries from an information-theoretic perspective. As a central result, we show that constraining the $S$-matrix to the span of minimally entangling operators is equivalent to realizing an emergent $SU(N)$ global symmetry.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations on Dimer Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <title>Weyl multiplet structure of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl group symmetric structure of SU(3) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with one flavor quark is considered. It has been demonstrated that Weyl group as a finite color subgroup of SU(3) provides an intrinsic color symmetry of quark and gluon fields on mass shell. We show that standard QCD equations of motion lead to systems of equations for quarks and gluons forming non-trivial irreducible multiplets in one- and two-dimensional representations of the Weyl group. Some implications of Weyl multiplet structure in QCD and hadron physics are considered.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Anisotropic Topological Yang Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation into anisotropic topological field theories which arise from a tropical limit of conventional isotropic topological field theories. We analyze both the TBF theory and the tropical analogue of 2D topological Yang-Mills theory (TrYM) through a direct path integral calculation which probes a deformed analytic torsion and also through canonical quantization. The explicit construction of the Hilbert space of TrYM theory demonstrates that the TrYM theory provides an example of a solvable field theory where anisotropy properties and topological invariance can simultaneously hold. We show that the partition function has an asymptotic limit, which verifies that the dimension of the moduli space of tropicalized flat connection on a Riemann surface of genus $g&gt;1$ is precisely given by $(g-1) \operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$. We conjecture that the large $N$ expansion of the associated matrix model of 2D TrYM is associated to the wedge region of nonequilibrium string theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Yang algebras isomorphic to $o(1,5), o(2,4), o(3,3)$ and derive dual $\kappa$-Minkowski and $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebras in terms of a metric $g$. The corresponding Weyl realization is presented and coproduct, star product and twist are computed in terms of the metric $g$. Finally, we construct reduced $\kappa$-Minkowski and $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebras as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress in constructing type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua that exhibit parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions for the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We comment on the anisotropic nature of the associated internal spaces, as well as on the existence of polynomial shift symmetries underlying the mass spectra. We conclude by outlining open questions and potential directions for future research, partially inspired by the Swampland program.</description>

      <title>Schwinger's non-commutative coordinates and duality between helicity and Dirac quantisation conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions.</description>

We also consider a special instance with $d=3$ in Type IIB superstring theory, discuss its ten-dimensional uplift and assess its supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Rank-two tensors and deconfinement in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the IR dynamics of $SU(N)$ gauge theories with four supercharges in 3d in presence of symmetric or antisymmetric tensor. Using the tensor deconfinement technique we provide some proofs of results previously claimed in the literature about confining dualities for $SU(N)$ with two antisymmetric tensors. Furthermore we study 3d confining dualities with symmetric tensors and linear monopole superpotentials. These confining dualities have been obtained by applying the duplication formula for the hyperbolic Gamma functions on effective dualities on $\mathbb{R}^{1,2} \times S^1$ with $SU(N)$ gauge groups and antisymmetric tensors. We conclude the analysis providing an alternative derivation, again using the tensor deconfinement technique.</description>

      <title>Universal Structures and Emergent Geometry from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ensemble average of boundary CFT (BCFT) data consistent with the bootstrap equations. We apply the results to computing ensemble average of copies of multi-point correlation functions of boundary changing operators (BCO), and find the results in agreement with one copy of the Virasoro TQFT. Further, we consider ensemble average of CFT path-integrals expressed as tensor networks of BCO correlation functions using the formalism developed in arXiv:2210.12127, arXiv:2311.18005 and arXiv:2403.03179. We find a natural emergence of locality and a loop-sum structure reminiscent of lattice integrable models. We illustrate this universal structure through explicit examples at genus zero and genus one. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that, at leading order in large-$c$, the results match those of three-dimensional Einstein gravity. In the presence of closed CFT operator insertions, generalized free fields emerge, with their correlation functions governed by the shortest paths connecting the insertions.</description>

      <title>Superstring amplitudes meet surfaceology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate tree-level amplitudes in open superstring theory (type-I) in terms of stringy Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes with various kinematical shifts in the "curve-integral" formulation: while the bosonic-string amplitude with $n$ pairs of "scaffolding" scalars comes from a particularly simple shift of the Tr$(\phi^3)$ one (corresponding to $n$ length-$2$ cycles), the analogous superstring amplitude requires "correction" terms given by bosonic-string amplitudes with longer, even-length "cycles", which are also Tr$(\phi^3)$ ones at shifted kinematics dictated by the cycles; in total it is expressed as a sum of $(2n{-}3)!!$ shifted amplitudes originated from the expansion of a reduced Pfaffian. Upon taking $n$ scaffolding residues, this leads to a new formula of the $n$-gluon superstring amplitude, which is manifestly symmetric in $n{-}1$ legs, as a gauge-invariant combination of mixed bosonic string amplitudes with gluons and scalars, which come from length-$2$ cycles and longer ones respectively (the total sum is associated with the expansion a $n\times n$ symmetrical determinant); the corresponding prefactors are nested commutators of $2n$-gon kinematical variables, which nicely become traces of field-strengths for those legs corresponding to scalars in the mixed amplitudes. These interesting linear combinations of bosonic string amplitudes must guarantee the cancellation of tachyon poles and $F^3$ vertices ${\it etc.}$, and they give new relations between the superstring amplitude and its bosonic-string building blocks to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion (the first order gives a new formula for gluon amplitudes with a single $F^3$ insertion in terms of Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes). We provide both the worldsheet and "curve-integral" derivations, and discuss applications to heterotic and type II cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of the much more involved covariant counterterm method, we apply the well justified background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrections to Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics induced by the higher derivative terms up to the cubic of Riemann tensor, where the computation is further simplified by the decomposition trick for the bulk action. The validity of our results is further substantiated by examining the corrections induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Moreover, by comparing our results with those obtained via the ADM and Wald formulas in the Lorentz signature, we can extract some generic information about the first order corrected black hole solutions induced by each higher derivative term.</description>

      <title>Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External magnetic field profiles leading to equidistant and partially equidistant bilayer graphene spectra within the tight-binding model are obtained. This is achieved by implementing the integral and differential versions of the second-order confluent algorithm to the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary real factorization energies. Additionally, new Barut-Girardello and Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for bilayer graphene are derived, for both diagonal and non-diagonal ladder operators. Their time evolution is analyzed, finding temporal stability and cyclic evolution in some cases. This fact is contrasted with the non-cyclic evolution of bilayer graphene coherent states obtained when using two different factorization energies. Likewise, the geometric phase and uncertainty product of the quadratures for the previously obtained coherent states are studied.</description>

      <title>The frozen vanilla model: Exploring dark sector interactions with delta effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new interacting mechanism within the dark sector, encompassing both dark energy and dark matter, while grounding our analysis in the familiar framework of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model augmented by baryons and radiation components, including photons and neutrinos. The interaction between dark energy and dark matter is confined to the perturbative level. One significant advantage of this proposal is that all geometric probes yield constraints consistent with the so-called vanilla model or the extended vanilla model, where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w_{x}$. However, the introduction of this new interacting mechanism affects several theoretical signatures, involving contrast dark matter and dark energy densities. We perform an exploratory analysis of those effects in the CMB power spectra, matter-power spectra, and redshift space distortions. For instance, it allows for a decrease/increment in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect depending on the value taken by the interaction coupling. This effect could be observationally detected by looking for a cross-correlation between the ISW temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies or quasars. At late times, the interaction in the dark sector becomes very effective, affecting the non-linear scale of structure formation. We discuss how the estimators $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $S_{8}(z)$ are affected by different interacting couplings; indicating that $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ can show a relative change of up to $15\%$ compared to the concordance model at low redshifts. Finally, we show how the various terms in the dark energy pressure perturbation (both adiabatic and non-adiabatic) are relevant for different scales, demonstrating the absence of large-scale instabilities.</description>

      <title>A Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

      <title>How Anomalous is the Electron's Magnetic Moment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron's spin magnetic moment is ordinarily described as anomalous in comparison to what one would expect from the Dirac equation. But, what exactly should one expect from the Dirac equation? The standard answer would be the Bohr magneton, which is a simple estimate of the electron's spin magnetic moment that can be derived from the Dirac equation either by taking the non-relativistic limit to arrive at the Pauli equation or by examining the Gordon decomposition of the electron's current density. However, these derivations ignore two effects that are central to quantum field theoretic calculations of the electron's magnetic moment: self-interaction and mass renormalization. Those two effects can and should be incorporated when analyzing the Dirac equation, to better isolate the distinctive improvements of quantum field theory. Either of the two aforementioned derivations can be modified accordingly. Doing so yields a magnetic moment that depends on the electron's state (even among $z$-spin up states). This poses a puzzle for future research: How does the move to quantum field theory take you from a state-dependent magnetic moment to a fixed magnetic moment?</description>

      <title>Do QGP Droplets Drive Anisotropy in Small Systems? Insights from RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are analyzed in large (Pb+Pb at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) and 5.02~TeV, Au+Au at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\)~GeV) and small (p+Pb at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02\) and 8.16~TeV, p+Au, d+Au, and \(^3\)He+Au at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\)~GeV) collision systems. The scaling functions' fidelity supports a hydrodynamic-like origin for the anisotropies in the flow-dominated regime. In large systems, anisotropies reflect QGP-driven expansion with strong radial flow and significant jet quenching. In small systems at RHIC, p+Au, d+Au, and \(^3\)He+Au show hadronic-dominated dynamics, with strong re-scattering, negligible radial flow, and suppressed jet quenching following the hierarchy: p+Au \(&gt;\) d+Au \(&gt;\) \(^3\)He+Au. At the LHC, ultra-central p+Pb collisions display enhanced radial flow, reduced re-scattering, and small but nonzero jet quenching. Scaling violations at high \(p_T\) reflect the partial suppression of partonic energy loss. These findings demonstrate that QGP-like behavior in small systems depends on both system size and beam energy, establishing the scaling framework as a robust tool for probing medium properties across diverse collision conditions.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition and Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has profound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically study the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the transition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model frameworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different electroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime, we numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract key properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma and field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across models when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be captured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications. These results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent the first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $p\bar{\Omega}$ states and femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent researches on the $p \Omega$ and $p \bar{\Lambda}$ systems, we investigate the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems within the framework of a quark model. Our results show that the attraction between a nucleon and $\bar{\Omega}$ is slightly stronger than that between a nucleon and $\Omega$, suggesting that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ system is more likely to form bound states. The dynamic calculations indicate that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems with both $J^{P}=1^{-}$ and $2^{-}$ can form bound states, with binding energies deeper than those of the $p \Omega$ systems with $J^{P}=2^{+}$. The scattering phase shift and scattering parameter calculations also support the existence of $p \bar{\Omega}$ states. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of the femtoscopic correlation function for the $p \bar{\Omega}$ pairs for the first time. Considering the significant progress in experimental measurements of the correlation function of the $p \Omega$ system, the further study of the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems using femtoscopic techniques will be a very valuable work.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>A Path to Quantum Simulations of Topological Phases: (2+1)D Wilson Fermions Coupled To U(1) Background Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$), which hosts a rich landscape of physical phenomena. A key challenge in lattice formulations is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to induce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of topological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We additionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 2d Ising Field Theory (IFT) in the low-temperature phase in lightcone quantization, and show that integrating out zero modes generates a very compact form for the effective lightcone interaction that depends on the finite volume vacuum expectation value of the $\sigma$ operator. This form is most naturally understood in a conformal basis for the lightcone Hilbert space. We further verify that this simple form reproduces to high accuracy results for the spectra, the $c$-function, and the form-factors from integrability methods for the magnetic deformation of IFT. For generic non-integrable values of parameters we also compute the above observables and compare our numeric results to those of equal-time truncation. In particular, we report on new measurements of various bound-state form-factors as well as the stress-tensor spectral density. We find that the stress tensor spectral density provides additional evidence that certain resonances of IFT are surprisingly narrow, even at generic strong coupling. Explicit example code for constructing the effective Hamiltonian is included in an appendix.</description>

Abstract: This paper contains two results of independent interest, the first being more mathematical in nature whereas the second more physical. We first show that the hierarchy of Higgs branch RG flows between the 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs known as A-type orbi-instantons is given by the Hasse diagram of certain strata and transverse slices in the double affine Grassmannian of $E_8$. Secondly, we leverage the partial order naturally defined on this Hasse diagram to prove the $a$-theorem for orbi-instanton Higgs branch RG flows, thereby exhausting the list of $c$-theorems in the even-dimensional (supersymmetric) setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ confining gauge theories with a matter field in the rank-two index symmetric representation. The models found here are obtained from the application of the duplication formula for hyperbolic gamma functions from \emph{parent} confining models, with antisymmetric fields and (anti)-fundamental matter by \emph{freezing} some of the mass parameters for the latter. We find a series of identities that can give rise to candidate confining theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group, a symmetric tensor and in addition other charged matter fields, in general with a non-vanishing superpotential. We provide for each case further checks of the proposed dualities, by studying the Coulomb branch and by deconfining the tensorial matter by using other known 3d dualities.

Abstract: The scattering amplitudes of string theory exhibit many extraordinary properties. But are they the unique mathematical objects to do so? Recently, it has been shown how the spectrum and amplitudes of open string theory follow directly from the assumptions of faster than power-law falloff at high energies and a property dubbed level truncation. At present there is no analogous principle for closed string scattering, which is famously rigid and naively impervious to modification. In this paper we analytically bootstrap the spectrum and four-point amplitudes of the closed string -- together with a parameterized space of deformations -- from conditions on high-energy falloff and level truncation. While these deformations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics literature about supersymmetry, many authors refer to "super Minkowski spaces". These spaces are affine supermanifolds with certain distinguished spin structures. In these notes, we make the notion of such spin structures precise and generalise the setup to curved supermanifolds. This leads to the more general notion of spinorial superspaces. By working in a suitable geometric and coordinate-free setting, many explicit coordinate computations appearing in physics literature can be replaced by more conceptual methods. As an application of the rather general framework of spinorial superspaces, we formulate $\mathcal N = 1$ super Yang-Mills theories on curved superspaces of spacetime dimensions $d=3$ and $d=4$ and show how to reduce the theory to field theories defined on an underlying ordinary spacetime manifold.</description>

Abstract: From a study of the subleading structure of the asymptotic equations of motion in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, we construct charges that are conserved up to quadratic order in non-radiative vacuum. We then show that these higher spin charges obey the celestial $sw_{1+\infty}$ symmetry algebra found earlier from the OPE of positive-helicity conformally soft gluons and gravitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider D-branes in the Dabholkar-Park (DP) background, a $9$d orientifold theory obtained by gauging symmetry in the type IIB string theory compactified on a circle. Using anomalies in the world-sheet theory, we provide physical insights into the classification of stable D-branes by relative KR-theory. The nature, such as stability, of D-branes wrapping along the compactified circle can be extracted from information about $1$d Majorana fermions on the boundary of the world-sheet. These Majorana fermions need to be introduced to consistently perform the GSO projection and the orientifold. We also construct D-brane states in the DP background. The spectrum of D-branes characterized by the relative KR-theory is correctly reproduced from the D-brane states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We verify a recently derived equations relating the renormalization group running of two gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED by the explicit three-loop calculation. It is demonstrated that these equations are really valid in the HD+MSL scheme. In other words, if a theory is regularized by higher covariant derivatives and the renormalization is made by minimal subtractions of logarithms, the analogs of the strong and electromagnetic gauge couplings do not run independently. However, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the considered equations do not hold starting from the three-loop order, where the scheme dependence becomes essential. Therefore, they are valid only for a certain set of the renormalization prescriptions. We prove that all of them can be obtained from the HD+MSL scheme by finite renormalizations which satisfy a special constraint and illustrate how this works in the three-loop approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

Abstract: We study the disk partition function of double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) in the small $\lambda$ limit, where $\lambda=-\log q$ is the coupling of DSSYK. We find that the partition function receives non-perturbative corrections in $\lambda$, which can be resummed by the cubic power of the Dedekind eta function in a certain low temperature limit. We also discuss a possible bulk interpretation of our findings.</description>

Abstract: We consider toroidal asymmetric orbifolds of the heterotic string preserving all 16 supercharges, developing a general formalism to study components of the moduli space characterized by rank reduction of the gauge group. In particular we construct six- and four-dimensional heterotic islands with no massless moduli other than the dilaton. The formalism involves the Leech lattice, its automorphisms and their corresponding invariant and normal, or coinvariant, sublattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryonic black branes describe the quantum critical phase of the conformal conifold gauge theory at strong coupling. This phase extends to zero temperature at a finite baryonic chemical potential, represented by extremal black branes with $AdS_2\times R^3\times T^{1,1}$ throat in asymptotic $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$ geometry. We demonstrate here that this phase is dynamically unstable below some critical value of $T_c/\mu$: the instability is represented by a diffusive mode in the hydrodynamic sound channel with a negative diffusion coefficient. We also identify a new (exotic) ordered phase of the conifold gauge theory: this phase originates at the same critical value of $T_c/\mu$, but extends to arbitrary high temperatures, and is characterized by an expectation value of a dimension-2 operator, ${\cal O}_2\propto T^2$, in the limit $\frac \mu T\to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider half BPS operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) in $p+1$ dimensions. These operators satisfy trace relations that are identical to those discussed in the $p=3$ case ($\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM). Nevertheless, the bulk explanation of these trace relations must differ from the $p = 3$ case as their holographic duals are not AdS spacetimes. We identify giant graviton solutions in the dual holographic backgrounds for $-1 \le p \le 4$. In the 't Hooft limit, these giants are D$(6-p)$-branes that wrap a $S_{6-p} \subset S_{8-p}$. We also follow the giants into the strong coupling region where they become other branes. Despite propagating in a non-AdS geometry, we find that the branes "feel" like they are in AdS. This is closely related to the emergent scaling symmetry present in these boundary theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general structure of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of spatial infinity. Starting from the general solution of the sourced Maxwell equations written in terms of multipole moments as obtained by Iyer and Damour, we derive the expansion of the electromagnetic field perturbatively in the electromagnetic coupling. At leading order, where the effect of long-range Coulombic interactions between charged particles is neglected, we discover infinite sets of antipodal matching relations satisfied by the electromagnetic field, which extend and sometimes correct previously known relations. At next-to-leading order, electromagnetic tails resulting from these Coulombic interactions appear, which affect the antipodal matching relations beyond those equivalent to the leading soft photon theorem. Moreover, new antipodal matching relations arise, which we use to re-derive the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem of Sahoo and Sen. Our analysis largely builds upon that of Campiglia and Laddha, although it invalidates the antipodal matching relation which they originally used in their derivation.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a stringy model for $n$-point tree-level form factor with the off-shell operator in the scalar and gluon theories, from the bosonic string disk amplitude: $n$ open string states and $1$ closed string state scatter on the disk. In the field-theory limit ($\alpha'\to0$), the stringy form factor reduces to the form factor, helps us to investigate the hidden properties of the field-theory form factors, manifest the factorization and soft behaviors, and uncover more non-trivial relations between form factors and scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of State Spaces into Subobjects in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with decreasing eigenvalue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. Using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lies in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, avoiding the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$ matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization in iCS field theory is also briefly discussed. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to ... ....</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities, some of them of a new kind which gives up the restriction of equivalence to second order Lagrangians. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new families of black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the flat space solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge and a subset of them exhibit also finite field strength and energy density, although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>

      <title>Towards constraining QCD phase transitions in neutron star interiors: Bayesian Inference with TOV linear response analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential hadron-to-quark phase transition in neutron stars has not been fully understood as the property of cold, dense, and strongly interacting matter cannot be theoretically described by the first-principle perturbative calculations, nor have they been systematically measured through terrestrial low-to-intermediate energy heavy-ion experiments. Given the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of the neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a strong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of reconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations of mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We conquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows one to parametrize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an algorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response analysis of the TOV equations. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $x$-ray and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength whose kinetic matrices are degenerate. This provides a generalisation of quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories for a U(1) gauge field. After establishing a classification of the independent Lagrangians, we obtain all the theories with at most third order field equations involving only second order derivatives of the metric, thus generalising Horndeski's quadratic theory for a gauge field. Some of these are shown to be conformally invariant. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in the strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge on key observables in gravitational lensing both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle, and for the magnification of the first relativistic image as a function of charge. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analog gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We study Lorentzian left-invariant metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. An almost abelian Lie group is a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelian ideal. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We explore the application of the exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to two-level Floquet systems and establish a systematic procedure to calculate the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. We show that, in the exact-WKB analysis, the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of cycle integrals (Voros symbol), which characterize monodromy matrices for Schr\"odinger-type differential equations governing two-level Floquet systems. We analytically evaluate the cycle integrals using the low-frequency expansion and derive both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. To verify the accuracy of our results, we compare them with numerical calculations and analyze resonant oscillations, which reveal non-perturbative features that cannot be captured by the perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Proca theory of four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet gravity and black holes with primary hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. The resulting theory is a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. Notably, one of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independent primary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant term. We further generalize these black hole solutions to include electromagnetic charges and effects related to the scalar-tensor counterparts of the regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory. We discuss the implications of our findings to observations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
