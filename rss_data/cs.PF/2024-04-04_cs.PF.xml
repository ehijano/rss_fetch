      <title>Heterogeneous Data Access Model for Concurrency Control and Methods to Deal with High Data Contention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OLTP has stringent performance requirements defined by Service Level Agreements. Transaction response time is used to determine the maximum throughout in benchmarks. Capacity planning tools for OLTP performance are based on queueing network models for hardware resources and database lock contention has a secondary effect on performance. With ever increasing levels of e-commerce and surges in OLTP traffic we discuss the need for studies of database workloads to develop more realistic lock/latch contention models. Predictive formulas to model increased load leading to thrashing for txns with identical and nonidentical steps are presented. We review concurrency control methods to reduce the level of lock/data conflicts in high contention environments.</description>

      <title>Speed, power and cost implications for GPU acceleration of Computational Fluid Dynamics on HPC systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the simulation of fluid flow undertaken with the use of computational hardware. The underlying equations are computationally challenging to solve and necessitate high performance computing (HPC) to resolve in a practical timeframe when a reasonable level of fidelity is required. The simulations are memory intensive, having previously been limited to central processing unit (CPU) solvers, as graphics processing unit (GPU) video random access memory (VRAM) was insufficient. However, with recent developments in GPU design and increases to VRAM, GPU acceleration of CPU solved workflows is now possible. At HPC scale however, many operational details are still unknown. This paper utilizes ANSYS Fluent, a leading commercial code in CFD, to investigate the compute speed, power consumption and service unit (SU) cost considerations for the GPU acceleration of CFD workflows on HPC architectures. To provide a comprehensive analysis, different CPU architectures, and GPUs have been assessed. It is seen that GPU compute speed is faster, however, the initialisation speed, power and cost performance is less clear cut. Whilst the larger A100 cards perform well with respect to power consumption, this is not observed for the V100 cards. In situations where more than one GPU is required, their adoption may not be beneficial from a power or cost perspective.</description>
