      <title>Worst-Case Values of Target Semi-Variances With Applications to Robust Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expected regret and target semi-variance are two of the most important risk measures for downside risk. When the distribution of a loss is uncertain, and only partial information of the loss is known, their worst-case values play important roles in robust risk management for finance, insurance, and many other fields. Jagannathan (1977) derived the worst-case expected regrets when only the mean and variance of a loss are known and the loss is arbitrary, symmetric, or non-negative. While Chen et al. (2011) obtained the worst-case target semi-variances under similar conditions but focusing on arbitrary losses. In this paper, we first complement the study of Chen et al. (2011) on the worst-case target semi-variances and derive the closed-form expressions for the worst-case target semi-variance when only the mean and variance of a loss are known and the loss is symmetric or non-negative. Then, we investigate worst-case target semi-variances over uncertainty sets that represent undesirable scenarios faced by an investors. Our methods for deriving these worst-case values are different from those used in Jagannathan (1977) and Chen et al. (2011). As applications of the results derived in this paper, we propose robust portfolio selection methods that minimize the worst-case target semi-variance of a portfolio loss over different uncertainty sets. To explore the insights of our robust portfolio selection methods, we conduct numerical experiments with real financial data and compare our portfolio selection methods with several existing portfolio selection models related to the models proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Optimal Robust Reinsurance with Multiple Insurers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a reinsurer who faces multiple sources of model uncertainty. The reinsurer offers contracts to $n$ insurers whose claims follow compound Poisson processes representing both idiosyncratic and systemic sources of loss. As the reinsurer is uncertain about the insurers' claim severity distributions and frequencies, they design reinsurance contracts that maximise their expected wealth subject to an entropy penalty. Insurers meanwhile seek to maximise their expected utility without ambiguity. We solve this continuous-time Stackelberg game for general reinsurance contracts and find that the reinsurer prices under a distortion of the barycentre of the insurers' models. We apply our results to proportional reinsurance and excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts, and illustrate the solutions numerically. Furthermore, we solve the related problem where the reinsurer maximises, still under ambiguity, their expected utility and compare the solutions.</description>

      <title>Differential Quantile-Based Sensitivity in Discontinuous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential sensitivity measures provide valuable tools for interpreting complex computational models used in applications ranging from simulation to algorithmic prediction. Taking the derivative of the model output in direction of a model parameter can reveal input-output relations and the relative importance of model parameters and input variables. Nonetheless, it is unclear how such derivatives should be taken when the model function has discontinuities and/or input variables are discrete. We present a general framework for addressing such problems, considering derivatives of quantile-based output risk measures, with respect to distortions to random input variables (risk factors), which impact the model output through step-functions. We prove that, subject to weak technical conditions, the derivatives are well-defined and derive the corresponding formulas. We apply our results to the sensitivity analysis of compound risk models and to a numerical study of reinsurance credit risk in a multi-line insurance portfolio.</description>
