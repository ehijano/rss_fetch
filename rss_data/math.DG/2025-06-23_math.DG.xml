      <title>Envelopes of lines, unfoldings and breaking symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the well-known ``embroidery'' envelopes of chords joining points at angles $t$ and $mt$ of a single circle in several ways. Firstly we allow $m$ to be rational (possibly negative) instead of integral, finding formulas for the number of cusps, points at infinity and self-intersections of these envelopes. Secondly we use two concentric circles instead of one, taking the chords to join a point of one circle to a point of the other. This construction allows the formation of different (higher) singularities -- not just simple cusps -- which however do not reveal their full inner structure when changing the radius of one of the circles. For this we need to break some of the symmetry and move the center of one of the circles as well as its radius. This permits the higher singularities, including swallowtails and butterflies,
  to be ``versally unfolded'' in the language of singularity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the supergeometric setting, the classical identification between differential forms of top degree and volume elements for integration breaks down. To address this, generalized notions of differential forms were introduced: pseudo-differential forms and integral forms (Bernstein-Leites), and $r|s$-forms (Voronov-Zorich). The Baranov-Schwarz transformation transforms pseudo-differential forms into $r|s$-forms. Also, integral $r$-forms are isomorphic to $r|m$-forms for a supermanifold of dimension $n|m$, yet the explicit construction of $r|s$-forms for arbitrary $s$ remains elusive.
  In this paper, we show that $1|1$-forms at a point can be realized as closed differential forms on a super projective space $\mathbb{P}^{m-1|n}$. We address a related problem involving the expansion of $\mathop{\mathrm{Ber}}(E + z A)$ for a linear operator on an $n|m$-dimensional space $V$, which generates supertraces of the representations $\Lambda^{r|s}(A)$ for $s=0$ and $s=m$ as the coefficients of the expansions near zero and near infinity, respectively. We demonstrate that the intermediate expansions in the annular regions between consecutive poles encode supertraces of representations on certain vector spaces that will be candidates for $\Lambda^{r|s}(V)$ for $0 &lt; s &lt; m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^m_t,g)$ be a semi-Riemannian manifold of dimension $m$ with a non-degenerate metric of \textit{index} $t$, $m\geq 2$, $1 \leq t \leq m-1$. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the existence of Frenet curves in $(M^m_t,g)$ which are polyharmonic of order $r$, shortly, $r$-harmonic. We shall focus primarily on the cases that the ambient space is a semi-Riemannian space form $N^m_t(c)$ of sectional curvature $c$, a ruled Lorentzian surface or a suitable, possibly warped, product space. We shall obtain existence, non-existence and classification results.</description>

      <title>On super cluster algebras based on super Pl\"ucker and super Ptolemy relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12072v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study super cluster algebra structure arising in examples provided by super Pl\"{u}cker and super Ptolemy relations. We develop the super cluster structure of the super Grassmannians $\Gr_{2|0}(n|1)$ for arbitrary $n$, which was indicated earlier in our joint work with Th. Voronov. For the super Ptolemy relation for the decorated super Teichm\"{u}ller space of Penner-Zeitlin, we show how by a change of variables it can be transformed into the classical Ptolemy relation with the new even variables decoupled from odd variables. We also analyze super Pl\"{u}cker relations for general super Grassmannians and obtain a new simple form of the relations for $\Gr_{r|1}(n|1)$. To this end, we establish properties of Berezinians of certain type matrices (which we call ``wrong'').</description>

      <title>A quantum anchor for higher Koszul brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15664v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the chain map between the de Rham and Poisson complexes on a Poisson manifold also maps the Koszul bracket of differential forms into the Schouten bracket of multivector fields.
  In the generalized case of a $P_\infty$-structure, where a Poisson bivector $P$ is replaced by an arbitrary even multivector obeying $[[P,P]]=0$, an analog of the chain map and an $L_\infty$-morphism from the higher Koszul brackets into the Schouten bracket are also known; however, they differ significantly in nature.
  In the present paper, we address the problem of quantizing this picture. In particular, we show that the $L_\infty$-morphism is quantized into a single linear operator, which is a formal Fourier integral operator.
  This paper employs Voronov's thick morphism technique and quantum Mackenzie-Xu transformations in the framework of $L_\infty$-algebroids.</description>

      <title>Approximate Ricci-flat Metrics for Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of the complex structure parameter.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple Black Holes from Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations that contain no trapped surfaces, yet whose future development admits multiple causally independent trapped surfaces. Assuming the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, this implies the formation of multiple black holes in finite time. The initial data are obtained by surgically modifying a vacuum geometrostatic manifold equipped with the Brill-Lindquist metric: the data agree exactly with the Brill-Lindquist metric outside a collection of balls centered at its multiple poles, and each ball is replaced by a constant-time slice of a well-prepared dynamical spacetime. The construction is based on Christodoulou's short-pulse framework, a stability analysis in the finite future of the short-pulse region, the geometry of geometrostatic manifolds with small mass and large separation, and the obstruction-free annular gluing method developed by Mao-Oh-Tao. The absence of trapped surfaces in the initial data is verified via a standard mean curvature comparison argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions for matrix-valued two-phase harmonic map flows with optimal lifespan, which arises as the limiting system of the matrix-valued Rubinstein-Sternberg-Keller problem studied by ({\em Invent. Math.}, 233(1):1--80, 2023). Our approach employs a modified minimizing movement scheme, discretizing the time domain and constructing approximate solutions by interpolating solutions to the associated functional problem within each small time interval.</description>

      <title>Thin homotopy and the signature of piecewise linear surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a crossed module of piecewise linear surfaces and study the signature homomorphism, defined as the surface holonomy of a universal translation invariant $2$-connection. This provides a transform whereby surfaces are represented by formal series of tensors. Our main result is that the signature uniquely characterizes a surface up to translation and thin homotopy, also known as tree-like equivalence in the case of paths. This generalizes a result of Chen and positively answers a question of Kapranov in the setting of piecewise linear surfaces. As part of this work, we provide several equivalent definitions of thin homotopy, generalizing the plethora of definitions which exist in the case of paths. Furthermore, we develop methods for explicitly and efficiently computing the surface signature.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Parameterization for 3-Dimensional Simply-Connected Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in technology, there has been growing interest in developing effective mapping methods for 3-dimensional objects in recent years. Volumetric parameterization for 3D solid manifolds plays an important role in processing 3D data. However, the conventional approaches cannot control the bijectivity and local geometric distortions of the result mappings due to the complex structure of the solid manifolds. Moreover, prior methods mainly focus on one property instead of balancing different properties during the mapping process. In this paper, we propose several novel methods for computing volumetric parameterizations for 3D simply-connected manifolds. Analogous to surface parameterization, our framework incorporates several models designed to preserve geometric structure, achieve density equalization, and optimally balance geometric and density distortions. With these methods, various 3D manifold parameterizations with different desired properties can be achieved. These methods are tested on different examples and manifold remeshing applications, demonstrating their effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Adapting \cite{strz3}, we define generalized $p$-harmonic maps into Riemannian homogeneous targets, a notion of solutions not belonging to the energy space. Restricting our attention to the subcritical range $p$ greater than the domain dimension $n$, we show a uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity result for a sequence of such maps in the limit $p \searrow n$, assuming a uniform $n$-energy bound on its elements. The method of the proof follows the exact same lines as in \cite{strz3} but we need to check uniformity of estimates not previously considered there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize Sacks-Uhlenbeck's existence result for harmonic spheres, constructing for $n \ge 2$, regular, non-trivial, $n$-harmonic $n$-spheres into suitable target manifolds. We obtain an infinite family of new null-homotopic such maps. The proof follows a similar perturbative argument, which in high dimensions leads to a degenerate and double-phase-type Euler-Lagrange system, making the uniform regularity needed to formalize the bubbling harder to achieve. Then, we develop a refined neck-analysis leading to an energy identity along the approximation, assuming a suitable Struwe-type entropy bound along a sequence of critical points. Finally, we combine these results to solve quite general min-max problems for the $n$-energy modulo bubbling.</description>

Abstract: On any closed hyperbolizable 3-manifold, we find a sharp relation between the minimal surface entropy (introduced by Calegari-Marques-Neves) and the average area ratio (introduced by Gromov), and we show that, among metrics g with scalar curvature greater than or equal to -6, the former is maximized by the hyperbolic metric. One corollary is to solve a conjecture of Gromov regarding the average area ratio. Our proofs use Ricci flow with surgery and laminar measures invariant under a PSL(2,R)-action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that nonnegative $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature combined with uniformly positive $k$-triRic curvature implies rigidity of complete noncompact two-sided stable minimal hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold $(X^5,g)$ with bounded geometry. The stonger assumption of nonnegative $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature can be replaced by the nonnegativity of Ricci and biRic curvature. In particular, there is no complete noncompact stable minimal hypersurface in a closed $5$-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature. This extends result of Chodosh-Li-Stryker [J. Eur. Math. Soc (2025)] to $5$-dimension. We also establish rigidity results on CMC hypersurfaces with nonzero mean curvature in $5$- and $6$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Harmonic metrics of $\mathrm{SO}_{0}(n,n)$-Higgs bundles in the Hitchin section on non-compact hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface. Hitchin constructed the $G$-Higgs bundles in the Hitchin section for a split real form $G$ of a complex simple Lie group,using the canonical line bundle $K$ and some holomorphic differentials $\boldsymbol{q}$. We study the case of ${\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$. In our work, we establish the existence of harmonic metrics for these Higgs bundles, which are compatible with the ${\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$-structure on any non-compact hyperbolic Riemann surface. Furthermore, these harmonic metrics weakly dominate $h_X$, the natural diagonal harmonic metric induced by the unique complete K\"ahler hyperbolic metric $g_X$ on $X$. Assuming these holomorphic differentials are all bounded with respect to $g_X$, we prove the uniqueness of such a harmonic metric.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove, for a class of first order differential operators containing the generalized gradients, Dirac and Penrose twistor operators, a family of Kato inequalities that interpolates between the classical and the refined Kato. For the Hodge-de-Rham operator we get a more detailed result. As a corollary, we get various Kato inequalities from the literature.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsed finite time singularities of the Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler surfaces are of Type I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any non-collapsed finite time singularity of the Ricci flow on a compact K\"ahler surface is of Type I. Combined with a previous result of the first author, Cifarelli, and Deruelle, it follows that any such singularity is modeled on the shrinking Ricci soliton of Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf on the total space of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)\to\mathbb{P}^{1}$.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the contractibility of spaces of invariant Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on compact connected manifolds of dimension at least two, with and without boundary and equipped with compact Lie group actions. On manifolds without boundary, we assume that the Lie group contains a normal $S^1$-subgroup with fixed-point components of codimension two. In this situation, the existence of invariant metrics of positive scalar curvature was known previously.
  For the proof, we combine equivariant Morse theory with conformal deformations near unstable manifolds. On manifolds without boundary, we also use local flexibility properties of positive scalar curvature metrics and the smoothing of mean-convex singularities.</description>

      <title>Flat Generalized Connections on Courant Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of metric generalized connections on transitive Courant algebroids, which includes the canonical Levi-Civita connection, and study the flatness condition. We find that the building blocks for such flat transitive Courant algebroids are compact simple Lie groups. Further, we give a description of left-invariant flat Levi-Civita generalized connections on such Lie groups, which, in particular, shows the existence of non-flat ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension greater than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of graph Laplacians with Ricci curvature bounds and in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative high-probability bounds on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph Laplacians constructed from i.i.d. random variables on $m$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ that satisfy a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound $\operatorname{Ric}_g\ge -(m-1)K$, a positive lower volume bound, and an upper diameter bound. These results extend to non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces that are measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such manifolds, and the bounds give a spectral approximation of weighted Laplacians on manifolds with non-smooth points.</description>

Abstract: We give a modern account of the classical theory of Bianchi \cite{Bia03} (see also \cite{KamPedPin98}) relating isothermic surfaces to Bonnet pairs. The main novelty is to identify the derivatives of the Bonnet pair with a component of the retraction form of the isothermic surface.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Characterization of Compact Affine Manifolds with Parallel Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that any affine manifold $(M,\nabla)$ endowed with a parallel volume form $\omega,$ admits, in any conformal class of Riemannian metrics, a representative $H$ for which $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. This provides a constructive proof that such manifolds are necessarily complete, generalizing the "if" direction of Markus' conjecture \cite{markus1962}. Moreover, our result demonstrates that these structures are intrinsically Riemannian-flat, a stronger conclusion than the affine completeness asserted by Markus. The metric $H$ arises naturally from the Hessian of volume-normalized distance functions and is shown to be globally smooth and $\nabla$-parallel, extending results of \cite{goldman1982} and \cite{benzecri1955} to higher dimensions with additional geometric structure. The construction proceeds through three technically novel steps: (1) local parallel metric normalization using the given volume form, (2) explicit Hessian calculations in adapted coordinates, and (3) gluing via affine transition maps that preserve the volumetric geometry. This approach reveals an unexpected rigidity in flat affine manifolds with compatible volume that goes beyond the topological constraints studied in \cite{fried1980}.</description>

      <title>On the Parallels Between Minimal Surfaces and Einstein Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces and Einstein manifolds are among the most natural structures in differential geometry. Whilst minimal surfaces are well understood, Einstein manifolds remain far less so. This exposition synthesises together a set of parallels between minimal surfaces embedded in an ambient three-manifold, and Einstein four-manifolds. These parallels include variational formulations, topological constraints, monotonicity formulae, compactness and epsilon-regularity theorems, and decompositions such as thick/thin and sheeted/non-sheeted structures. Though distinct in nature, the striking analogies between them raises a profound question: might there exist circumstances in which these objects are, in essence, manifestations of the same underlying geometry? Drawing on foundational results such as Jensen's theorem, Takahashi's theorem, and a conjecture of Song, this work suggests a bridge between the two structures. In particular, it shows that certain Einstein four-manifolds admit a minimal immersion into a higher-dimensional sphere. A key example of this is the embedding of $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ into $S^{7}$ via the Veronese map, where it arises as a minimal submanifold.</description>

      <title>Rust Implementation of Finite Element Exterior Calculus on Coordinate-Free Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of a novel finite element library in Rust based on the principles of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). The library solves partial differential equations formulated using differential forms on abstract, coordinate-free simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions, employing an intrinsic Riemannian metric derived from edge lengths via Regge Calculus. We focus on solving elliptic Hodge-Laplace eigenvalue and source problems on the nD de Rham complex. We restrict ourselves to first-order Whitney basis functions. The implementation is partially verified through convergence studies.</description>
