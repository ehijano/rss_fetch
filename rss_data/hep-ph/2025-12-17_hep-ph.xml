      <title>Improved Standard-Model predictions for $\eta^{(\prime)}\to \ell^+ \ell^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare decays $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\ell^+\ell^-$, $\ell\in\{e,\mu\}$, are highly suppressed in the Standard Model, both by their chirality structure and the required loop attaching the lepton line to the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ matrix element. The latter is described by a single scalar function, the transition form factor, which has recently been studied in great detail for $\eta^{(\prime)}$ in the context of the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Based on these results, we evaluate the corresponding prediction for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ dilepton decays, supplemented by an improved evaluation of the asymptotic contributions including pseudoscalar mass effects. In particular, the dispersive representation for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors allows us, for the first time, to perform a robust evaluation of the imaginary parts due to subleading channels besides the dominant two-photon cut. Our final results are $\text{Br}[\eta\to e^+e^-]=5.37(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[\eta\to \mu^+\mu^-]=4.54(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-6}$, $\text{Br}[\eta'\to e^+e^-]=1.80(2)(3)[3]\times 10^{-10}$, and $\text{Br}[\eta'\to \mu^+\mu^-]=1.22(2)(2)[3]\times 10^{-7}$, where the errors refer to the uncertainty in the normalized branching fraction, the one propagated from $\text{Br}[\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma]$, and the total uncertainty, respectively. The branching fraction for $\eta\to\mu^+\mu^-$ exhibits a mild $1.6\sigma$ tension with experiment, and we explore the bounds that can be derived on physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Detection with Dark Rates in Liquid Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that standard sub-GeV dark matter candidates can be effectively probed by large neutrino observatories via annual modulation of the total photomultiplier hit rate. That work focused on the production of light by the excitation of scintillator molecules and considered the JUNO detector, surpassing limits from dedicated dark-matter detectors and reaching theoretical targets. Here, we significantly generalize that work, now also taking into account ionization channels and extending the analysis to other liquid-scintillator detectors, including SNO+, Daya Bay, Borexino, and KamLAND. Last, we present a call to action: with multiple detectors achieving competitive sensitivity, there is an opportunity to validate this new technique across experiments and to refine it using each detector's strengths.</description>

      <title>Domain Walls in $A_4$ Flavour Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of an $A_4$ flavour symmetry, often used to predict leptonic mixing, can lead to the formation of domain walls which can annihilate and generate a stochastic gravitational wave background. We study this phenomenon in three scenarios where the nature of the scalar field responsible for breaking the $A_4$ symmetry spontaneously differs: real, complex, and supersymmetric. For the real scalar, a biased potential produces metastable walls that decay into oscillating two-wall systems with important consequences for gravitational wave signals. In the complex scalar case, we discuss the interplay between domain walls and global strings and classify the types of domain walls that form in terms of the $A_4$ group symmetries. We investigate the properties of supersymmetric $A_4$ domain walls, and highlight the BPS walls. Finally we show how these results may be achieved in leptonic $A_4$ flavour models, with and without supersymmetry, and discuss their distinctive gravitational wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Look everywhere effects in anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection methods are able to search high-dimensional spaces for hints of new physics with much less theory bias than traditional searches. However, by searching in many directions all at once, the statistical power of these search strategies is diluted by a variant of the look elsewhere effect. We examine this challenge in detail, focusing on weakly supervised methods. We find that training and testing on the same data results in badly miscalibrated $p$-values due to the anomaly detector searching everywhere in the data and overfitting on statistical fluctuations. However, if these $p$-values can be calibrated, they may offer the best sensitivity to anomalies, since this approach uses all of the data. Conversely, training on half of the data and testing on the other half results in perfectly calibrated $p$-values, but at the cost of reduced sensitivity to anomalies. Similarly, regularization methods such as early stopping can help with $p$-value calibration but also possibly at the expense of sensitivity. Finally, we find that k-folding strikes an effective balance between calibration and sensitivity. Our findings are supported by numerical studies with Gaussian random variables as well as from collider physics using the LHC Olympics benchmark anomaly detection dataset.</description>

      <title>Magnetoviscosity of relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles quantum field-theoretical methods, we investigate the shear and bulk viscosities of strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas. The analysis is performed within the weak-coupling approximation and utilizes known results for the fermion damping rates in the Landau-level representation, $\Gamma_{n}(p_{z})$, which are dominated by one-to-two and two-to-one processes in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The transverse and longitudinal components of the viscosities are derived using Kubo's linear response theory. Our results reveal a pronounced anisotropy in both shear and bulk viscosities induced by the magnetic field. In the case of an electron-positron plasma, where the weak-coupling approximation is well justified, the dimensionless longitudinal shear viscosity $\eta_{\parallel}/T^3$ increases rapidly with the magnetic field strength, while the transverse component $\eta_{\perp}/T^3$ decreases and can even drop below the KSS bound at sufficiently large fields. In contrast, both the dimensionless longitudinal and transverse bulk viscosities, $\zeta_{\perp}/T^3$ and $\zeta_{\parallel}/T^3$, initially rise from small values, reach a maximum, and then gradually decrease toward zero. We find that the bulk viscosity is highly sensitive to the longitudinal and transverse components of the sound velocity, particularly at high magnetic fields, indicating that its quantitative values should be interpreted with caution. We also calculate an additional cross viscosity, which is negative and whose magnitude increases with the magnetic field strength. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of these magnetoviscosity results in the contexts of magnetar physics and the strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>An Excited Dark Matter Solution to the MeV Galactic Center Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $\chi$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $\chi^*$, followed by de-excitation $\chi^*\to\chi e^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_\chi\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $\Delta m =m_{\chi^*}-m_\chi \simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $\sigma_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive novel constraints on scalar-tensor theories from neutrino physics. Spatial variations of the background scalar field effectively generate density and position-dependent Standard Model masses, including neutrinos. Neutrinos are a unicum in the SM due to their ability both to propagate over galactic distances and to traverse dense media such as Earth. This makes them an ideal probe of the background scalar field, which can in turn alter flavour oscillations and supernova time delays. As we enter the era of precision neutrino physics, we are compelled to explore such a scenario. We derive expressions for the relevant observables and obtain new bounds on a broad class of scalar-tensor models. We finally map the bounds to popular screening mechanisms models, such as the Symmetron and Chameleon.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Epoch: Impact of Mediator Induced Matter Domination in Freeze-in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freeze-in dark matter has recently garnered significant attention as a promising framework due to its feeble interactions, which are consistent with the null results from dark matter experiments. While previous studies have extensively investigated the production of dark matter through the decay of heavy particles, they overlook the cosmological role of the decaying mediator without justifying this assumption. We emphasize that the mediator can dominate the energy budget of the early universe during its decay, leading to an unavoidable early matter-dominated era. This intrinsic matter-dominated phase influences dark matter production in two key ways: (i) dark matter production occurs in both the early radiation and induced matter-dominated phases; specifically, considerable production occurs in the matter-dominated phase and stops when the mediator decays fully, and (ii) it causes dilution in dark matter abundance due to entropy injection before its saturation. Furthermore, this effect significantly alters the gravitational wave signature associated with the production of freeze-in dark matter through graviton emission during the mediator's decay. Specifically, it enhances the gravitational wave spectrum, making it viable for future high-frequency gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Higgs Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines frameworks and phenomenology of ultrarelativistic Higgs vacuum bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition associated with the Standard Model Higgs field in the early Universe. Such collisions act as a cosmic scale Higgs collider, providing access to energy scales far beyond any temperature reached in our cosmic history, potentially up to the Planck scale. This provides a unique opportunity to probe new physics that couples to the Higgs at very high scales, while also enabling novel applications for various cosmological phenomena, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. As examples, we demonstrate the viability of nonthermal production of ultra-heavy Higgs portal dark matter up to $10^{16}$ GeV (with observable indirect and direct detection signals up to $m_\text{DM}=O(10)$ TeV), and leptogenesis from the production of GUT scale right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Stellar Superradiance and Low-Energy Absorption in Dense Nuclear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons such as axions and dark photons are well-motivated hypothetical particles, whose couplings to ordinary matter can be effectively constrained by stellar cooling. Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <title>Glueballs Confinement and Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework in which the dynamics of a scalar glueball field, originating from phenomenological nonperturbative QCD confinement, simultaneously governs the deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter and drives cosmological inflation. Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(\phi, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{c\phi}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T &gt; T_{c\phi}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $\alpha_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $\gamma$ and for $N \approx 50\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72\gamma$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $\sigma^2$ and the coupling $\gamma$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics. These results demonstrate that a confinement-inspired potential can naturally reproduce the observed inflationary phenomenology and offer a novel bridge between early-universe cosmology and the nonperturbative sector of QCD.</description>

      <title>Substructure grooming of inclusive and photon-tagged jets in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet substructure provides a powerful probe of partonic interactions within the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we present a systematic theoretical study of the groomed substructures for both inclusive jets and photon-tagged jets ($\gamma+$jets) utilizing the Dynamical and Soft-Drop Grooming algorithms in PbPb collisions by employing the SHELL transport model. Our theoretical calculations exhibit a suppression at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, the relative transverse momentum between the two subjets in the groomed substructure, consistent with the recent ALICE measurements. We show that the suppression of high $k_{\rm T,g}$ arises from the combined effects of the reduction of the subleading subjet transverse momentum due to partonic energy loss and the narrowing of the groomed jet radius $R_g$ induced by selection bias. Our findings demonstrate that no enhancement is observed at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, even in the complete absence of selection bias. Furthermore, we propose that the broadening of $R_g$ in photon-tagged jets, which are less susceptible to selection bias compared to inclusive jets, provides relatively direct evidence of the jet substructure broadening. Our analysis reveals that the $R_g$ broadening becomes more pronounced as the jet radius increases, where the medium-induced gluon radiation plays a dominant role in driving such broadening. In particular, we find that as the jet radius increases, the Soft Drop grooming algorithm exhibits a better resolving power for the contribution of the medium response to the jet substructure broadening.</description>

      <title>Explicit Rephasing to PDG Standard Form and Origin of CP-Violating Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a fully explicit rephasing transformation that maps an arbitrary mixing matrix to the PDG standard parameterization, a procedure that had remained conceptual for more than four decades. As a result, all six phases of the mixing matrix, including the Dirac and Majorana phases are expressed systematically using only the arguments of matrix elements and the determinant. We further extend this framework to the diagonalization matrices of fermions, allowing the observable CP phases to be expressed by
  fermion-specific Dirac-like phases, Majorana-like phases, and relative phases between different fermion sectors. This formulation provides a transparent and universal description of CP violation, with direct applications to both low-energy experiments and high-energy theories of flavor.</description>

      <title>Global fits and the search for new physics: past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we review the history and current role of global fits in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model~(BSM), including precision tests of the Standard Model (SM). Although BSM global fits were initially focused on minimal supersymmetric models, we describe how fits have evolved in response to new data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere, expanding to encompass a broad spectrum of BSM scenarios including non-minimal supersymmetry, axion-like particles, extended Higgs sectors, dark matter models, and effective field theories such as SMEFT. We discuss how the role of global fits has shifted from forecasting possible signals of new physics at the LHC to understanding the impact of null results from LHC run-I and II and the discovery of the Higgs boson, and how interest has shifted from global fits for parameter estimation to comprehensive model comparison. We close by discussing potential trends and future applications, emphasizing the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of sampling algorithms and comparison between theory and experiment, as well as collaboration and software development.</description>

      <title>A new idea for relating the asymmetric dark matter mass scale to the proton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric dark matter is a well-motivated approach to explain the apparent coincidence between the relic densities of visible and dark matter, $\Omega_D \simeq 5.4\Omega_b$. A complete explanation requires two components, a relation between the particle masses of the dark and visible matter, and a second relation between the number densities in each sector. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to address the former. We consider an extended $SU(3)_1 \times SU(3)_2$ colour group in the visible sector, with QCD embedded as the diagonal subgroup. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry then relates $SU(3)_2$ to a dark, confining $SU(3)_D$ sector. The dark matter is a composite state of dark fermions transforming in the fundamental representation of $SU(3)_D$. The spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry ultimately leads to a relation between the QCD and dark gauge couplings which, for suitable field content, gives rise to confinement scales of the same order of magnitude. The mechanism leads to a rich particle spectrum above the TeV scale which could be probed at future experiments. The model also naturally includes an axion solution to the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalization Group in EFTs: On-Shell Bases, Ambiguities, and Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results for two-loop renormalization group (RG) functions in effective field theories exhibit unphysical divergences when calculated in an on-shell operator basis. We demonstrate that this can be understood to be a result of omitting non-minimal source terms in the renormalized vacuum functional, which are essential to maintaining renormalizability of and describing the RG flow of Green's functions in an on-shell framework. With the inclusion of the missing source terms, any remaining divergences are ambiguous, generating only unphysical RG flow directed along flavor rotations, and the RG functions are RG-finite. We carefully examine the role of flavor rotations in generating ambiguities in both on- and off-shell RG functions and explore the geometry of a physical coupling space.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bounds on Scotogenic Model with Asymmetric Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological constraints on the asymmetric mediator scenario, a variant of the scotogenic model that addresses the origins of neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry. An SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar $\eta$ mediates between the visible and dark sectors, while a singlet scalar $\sigma$ serves as the DM candidate. We evaluate the DM relic abundance by solving the Boltzmann equations including $\eta$ decay and scattering processes prior to the freeze-out of the $\eta$ asymmetry, and show Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints from late-time $\eta$ decays. Combining the DM abundance and BBN bounds, we find the favored parameter space of this model, for instance, the mediator masses of $m_\eta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Analytic results for one-loop integrals in dimensional regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to obtain analytic results in terms of multiple polylogarithms for one-loop triangle, box and pentagon integrals depending on an arbitrary number of scales and to any desired order in the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\varepsilon$. Our method leverages the fact that for $\varepsilon=0$ one-loop integrals compute volumes of simplices in hyperbolic spaces, which can always be evaluated in terms of polylogarithms using an algorithm recently introduced in pure mathematics. The higher orders in $\varepsilon$ can then be expressed as a one-fold integral involving the result for $\varepsilon=0$. Remarkably, we find that for up to five external legs, all integrals can be evaluated algorithmically in terms of polylogarithms using direct integration techniques, which, in particular, requires us to rationalise all appearing square roots. We also discuss how we can use the connection to hyperbolic geometry to perform the analytic continuation from the Euclidean region to other kinematic regions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of local acceleration of quark-gluon plasma in the dilepton production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilepton production is one of the key probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) that encodes the imaginary part of the electromagnetic current-current correlator. We investigate the effect of local acceleration on the dilepton production by treating acceleration as a small perturbation. Using the thermal Dirac propagator in an accelerated frame within the imaginary-time formalism, we compute the photon polarization tensor and extract its imaginary part. Comparison with the zero-acceleration case isolates the distinct contributions of acceleration to dilepton yields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed fixed-target experiment, MUonE, at CERN will aim to measure the hadronic contribution to the running of the QED coupling by analysing the scattering of muons on electrons. Here we present state-of-the-art predictions for the process $\mu^{\pm}e^-\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}e^-$, where for the first time an all-order resummation of soft and soft-collinear logarithms has been performed. Further, we match this resummation with the complete next-to-leading and the dominant next-to-next-to-leading higher-order corrections. We find that the resummation has a dominant effect in the signal region, while the systematic matching significantly reduces the perturbative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>On the coverage of electroweak-inos within the pMSSM with SModelS -- a comparison with the ATLAS pMSSM study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration has recently performed a vast scan of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) with a focus on the electroweak-ino sector, and analysed how their Run 2 searches for electroweak production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles constrain this dataset. All the SLHA files from the scan as well as the constraints from the eight individual searches considered by ATLAS were made publicly available. We use this material to study how well the ATLAS constraints can be reproduced with SModelS v3.0. Moreover, we explore how the picture changes when also including CMS results, and what can be gained by the statistical combination of analyses. Finally, we discuss the part of parameter space with light electroweak-inos that remains valid despite the stringent LHC limits. Our results underscore the need of a broad, multifaceted approach for maximising sensitivity and closing loopholes in the extensive SUSY parameter space.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Confinement in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the gravitational wave spectrum of $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory. The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions.</description>

      <title>Matching between Collinear Twist-3 and TMD Fragmentation Function Contributions to Polarized Hyperon Production in SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency between the collinear twist-3 factorization and the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization for the transversely polarized hyperon production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, $ep\to e\Lambda^\uparrow X$. In particular, we focus on the contributions from the twist-3 fragmentation functions (FFs) and the TMD polarizing FF in the region of the hyperon's intermediate transverse momentum $P_T$, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\ll P_T\ll Q$, where both frameworks are valid. In this region the polarizing FF can be expressed in terms of the twist-3 FFs including the purely gluonic ones, and the resulting TMD factorization formula for $ep\to e\Lambda^\uparrow X$ agrees with the small-$P_T$ limit of the corresponding twist-3 cross section. This matching of the two calculations indicates that the two frameworks describe the same effect in QCD and provide complementary frameworks for the process in different kinematic regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged Higgs-boson pair production at hadron colliders yields information about the trilinear couplings involving charged Higgs fields in extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We consider the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) extension and obtain next-to-leading order QCD predictions for the charged-Higgs pair production ($H^+H^-$ production). All production modes, i.e. Drell--Yan-like production, gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion are included in the analysis. We determine uncertainties originating from the scale dependence, the parton-density functions and strong coupling $\alpha_s$ at the LHC. We observe that the QCD corrections lead to a significant reduction of the relative scale dependences. These improved predictions will allow for a quantitative interpretation of experimental measurements, in case that charged Higgs states will be observed.</description>

      <title>$B$-meson decay width up to $1/m_b^3$ corrections within and beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the most general effective Hamiltonian describing non-leptonic $b$-quark decays $b\to q_1 \bar q_2 q_3$, we compute analytic expressions for all matching coefficients of the two-quark operator contributions in the heavy quark expansion~(HQE) of a $B$ meson, up to mass-dimension-six. In addition, we calculate the weak-annihilation contributions, which enter the matching of four-quark operators in the HQE at dimension-six and were previously missing. Our results complete the calculation of beyond Standard Model effects in non-leptonic, tree-level, $b$-quark decays relevant for $B$ meson lifetimes and lifetime ratios such as $\tau(B^0_s)/\tau(B^0_d)$. Such effects naturally arise in extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that aim to address the observed tensions between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions based on QCD factorisation in several colour-allowed non-leptonic $B$-meson decays. As a by-product of our calculation, we also determine the matching coefficients in the HQE induced by the QCD-penguin operators within the SM, including both the interference between current-current and penguin operators and the contributions quadratic in the penguin operators. Owing to the suppression of the QCD-penguin Wilson coefficients within the SM, these effects are typically regarded as corrections of order $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha_s^2$ in the strong coupling, respectively. Our results reproduce the known expressions at dimension-three and provide new results for the coefficients of the chromomagnetic operator at dimension-five and of the Darwin operator at dimension-six.</description>

      <title>Swampland bound on quintessential inflation in IDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quintessential inflation scenario based on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) coupled to a quintessence field via an exponential potential $V_0e^{-\beta\phi/M_p}$. Using a conformal transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame, we derive an effective Starobinsky-type potential modulated by an exponential factor that naturally unifies the inflationary epoch with the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. We analyze the resulting two-field dynamics, compute the slow-roll parameters, the primordial perturbation spectrum, as well as the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$, and then confront the predictions with the latest $Planck$ and $BICEP/Keck$ data. We find amongst others that the quintessence inflaton coupling must remain extremely weak, in the order of $\beta \lesssim 4\times10^{-3}$, to satisfy current $CMB$ data, whereas swampland dS conjecture favors a step potential with $\beta\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, signaling a significant tension between quantum gravity consistency and cosmological viability. We conclude by discussing possible extensions and stabilization mechanisms that could help reconcile the inflationary predictions with swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: unlocking threshold-free emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, with an axion angle linear in time, to describe a charge moving at constant velocity. By solving the modified Maxwell's equations in cylindrical coordinates and in the space-frequency domain, we derive closed expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields contributing independently to the radiation. The dispersion relations are obtained by imposing causality at a cylindrical surface at infinity, ensuring outgoing waves. Contrary to initial suppositions, each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, describing radiation at a characteristic angle. We characterize the angles and identify frequency ranges that allow for zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones. Notably, one sector of the model enables threshold-free Cherenkov radiation from slowly moving charges. Our results agree with partial findings in the nonrelativistic limit of earlier iterative analysis and clarify the regimes in which Cherenkov radiation arises in isotropic chiral matter.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron pair creation induced by multi-pulse train of electric fields: effect of randomness in time-delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the creation of electron-positron pairs (EPPs) in a sequence of alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains by solving the quantum Vlasov equations. Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $\sigma_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $\sigma_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $\sigma_T \approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $\sigma_T \approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation.</description>

      <title>Resonances: Universality and Factorization on Higher Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most particles in nature are unstable, manifesting as resonances in scattering processes. Using analyticity and unitarity, we show nonperturbatively that resonances, defined as poles on higher Riemann sheets of scattering amplitudes, share basic properties with stable particles: (i) Universality, that a resonance generically appears in every S-matrix element; and (ii) Factorization, that amplitudes factorize on resonance poles. Our framework applies in any spacetime dimension and across arbitrarily many two-particle cuts, including cases where the kinematic Riemann surface becomes infinitely sheeted. Importantly, we find that resonance data (mass, width, couplings, and sheet index) are fully encoded on the physical sheet, where causality can impose additional constraints. These results are relevant for extending S-matrix bootstrap studies beyond elastic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce infrared finite, analytic, crossing symmetric, Regge behaved, and Lorentz invariant amplitudes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal {E}}$, labeled by the experimental energy resolution $\mathcal{E}$ for detecting soft photons and gravitons. For $\mathcal{E}$ exponentially smaller than any hard scale, they also satisfy unitarity and their associated cross sections reproduce the inclusive, infrared-finite cross sections of ordinary amplitudes. These properties make $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{E}}$ suitable for deriving infrared-safe positivity bounds on effective field theories in the presence of long-range forces even in $D=4$. As an illustration, we present explicit bounds in the low-energy theory of pions coupled to electromagnetism and gravity.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Feynman-integral geometries at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman-integral geometries at two-loop order in four-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with standard quadratic propagators. Concretely, we consider a finite basis of integrals in the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme, i.e. with $D$-dimensional loop momenta and four-dimensional external momenta, which belong to 79 independent topologies, or sectors. Then, we analyze the leading singularities of the integrals in those sectors for generic values of the masses and momenta, using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation. Aside from the Riemann sphere, we find that elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 as well as K3 surfaces occur. Moreover, we find for the first time in Feynman integrals a smooth and non-degenerate Del Pezzo surface of degree 2, a particular Fano variety known to be rationalizable, resulting in a curve of geometric genus 3. These geometries determine the space of functions relevant for Quantum Field Theories at two-loop order, including in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Abelian Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the electromagnetic $\theta$-term is a physical parameter of the Standard Model coupled to gravity. Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $\theta$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $\theta$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <title>The Role of Microstate Degeneracy in Phase Transitions: Gravitational Waves from Bubble Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for gauge invariant flow equations in dilaton quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of quantum gravity for models of a scalar singlet coupled to the metric. Such models describe inflation for early cosmology and dynamical dark energy for late cosmology. We work within the ''variable gravity approximation" keeping in the effective action an arbitrary field dependence for terms with up to two derivatives. We focus on the scaling solutions of the gauge invariant functional flow equation which describes the dependence of the effective action on a momentum or length scale. The existence of such solutions is required for the ultraviolet fixed point defining an ultraviolet complete renormalizable quantum field theory for gravity. Our findings strengthen the case for the presence of a ''dilaton quantum gravity fixed point" for which the Planck mass increases proportional to the scalar field for large field values. This fixed point is different from the extended Reuter fixed point with a flat scalar potential and field-independent Planck mass, which is also seen in our setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of gravitational waves by axion domain walls in teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term. Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall.</description>

      <title>The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Elementary Target Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise neutrino-nucleon amplitudes are essential ingredients for predicting neutrino event rates in current and upcoming long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. A common neutrino interaction with a low reaction threshold and with most of the energy carried by two final state particles is quasielastic scattering, for which the nucleon axial form factor, $F_{A}(Q^{2})$, is a dominant source of uncertainty. Improvements to the nucleon axial form factor rely on neutrino scattering data with elementary targets to reduce or eliminate the need for nuclear modeling systematics. This work examines constraints on the nucleon axial form factor that can be achieved from datasets of neutrino scattering on deuterium targets, Lattice QCD predictions, and from the recent hydrogen target data from the MINERvA Collaboration. Significant tension is found between hydrogen and deuterium target data, suggesting that extractions from deuterium underestimate both the central value and uncertainty of the form factor. Parameterizations for and uncertainties of the nucleon axial form factor using the $z$ expansion are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light-shining-through-a-wall experiment ALPS II at DESY in Hamburg searched for axions and similar lightweight particles in its first science campaign from February to May 2024. No evidence for the existence of such particles was found. For pseudoscalar bosons like the axion, with masses below about 0.1 meV, we achieved a limit for the di-photon coupling strength of 1.5e-9 1/GeV at a 95% confidence level. This is more than a factor of 20 improvement compared to all previous similar experiments. We also provide limits on photon interactions for scalar, vector and tensor bosons. An achievement of this first science campaign is the demonstration of stable operation and robust calibration of the complex experiment. Currently, the optical system of ALPS II is being upgraded aiming for another two orders of magnitude sensitivity increase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale limits on the relic signals of gravitational radiation complement the bounds coming from the interferometric detectors (in the audio band) and from the pulsar timing arrays (in the nHz range). Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial features and low-$\ell$ suppression from isocurvature modes in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study primordial perturbations in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation in the presence of a non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs and the scalaron. By performing a full numerical integration of the multifield background and linear perturbations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the non-minimal coupling $\xi_h$. For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the turning rate of the inflationary trajectory induces transient multifield effects that imprint localized features in the scalar power spectrum. In the limit $\xi_h\ll 1$, the adiabatic spectrum becomes featureless, but isocurvature modes fail to fully decay, leaving a residual contribution at the end of inflation. We compute CMB angular power spectra TT, TE, EE and show how these regimes yield distinct observational signatures, delineating the parameter space compatible with current bounds. Our results highlight that suppressing spectral features does not guarantee the elimination of isocurvature perturbations, placing non-trivial constraints on Higgs-$R^2$ multifield realizations and motivating future probes sensitive to primordial isocurvature.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by arbitrary source fields that are amplified during cosmological inflation. The associated tensor spectral index is shown to be given, under minimal assumptions, by a simple formula easy to use in most situations of accelerated expansion. For slow-roll inflation, the induced spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, with an index that slightly deviates from the standard outcome of vacuum generated gravitational waves. Remarkably, we demonstrate that scale invariance remains true regardless of the original spectrum of the source.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings Gravitational Wave Probe of Leptogenesis: Thermal, Non-thermal, Near-resonant and Flavourful</title>

Abstract: Breaking a global or local $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry at high scales simultaneously generates Majorana masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new bounds on hadronically-interacting, sub-GeV mass dark matter. First, we show that one-loop interactions with photons can be sufficient to maintain equilibrium between the dark matter and Standard Model sectors at MeV temperatures, resulting in constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Using chiral perturbation theory, we find that this leads to an upper bound on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section that is orders of magnitude stronger than existing astrophysical constraints. Furthermore, we show that even if these interactions remain out of equilibrium, there is an irreducible freeze-in abundance of dark matter that can easily overclose the universe. We also compute new bounds from rare Kaon decays that can provide even stronger constraints. Our results have significant implications for future direct detection experiments aiming to search for MeV-scale dark matter.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>

      <title>Testing the Froggatt-Nielsen Mechanism with Lepton Flavor and Number Violating Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism offers an elegant explanation for the observed masses and mixings of Standard Model fermions. In this work, we systematically study FN models in the lepton sector, identifying a broad range of charge assignments ("textures") that naturally yield viable masses and mixings for various neutrino mass generation mechanisms. Using these textures, we consider higher-dimensional operators consistent with a FN origin and find that natural realizations predict distinct patterns in lepton flavor- and number-violating observables. For Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, FN-related correlations can lead to detectable rates of charged lepton flavor violation at next-generation low-energy experiments. Majorana and type-I seesaw models predict measurable rates of neutrinoless double beta decay. Determination of inverted neutrino mass ordering would exclude the Dirac neutrino FN scenario. Only a small minority of purely leptonic FN models predict detectable flavor violation at future muon colliders, though it is possible that a combined analysis with the quark sector will reveal motivated signals. These findings highlight the power of the FN mechanism to link neutrino mass generation to testable leptonic observables, offering new pathways for the experimental exploration of lepton number and underscoring the importance of next-generation low-energy probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply non-invertible selection rules coming from a fusion algebra to radiative neutrino mass models where fields are labeled by the elements in the algebra. Since non-invertible selection rules only hold at tree level, radiative corrections naturally explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Furthermore, a remnant symmetry of the fusion algebra protects the stability of dark matter, which is conventionally imposed in radiative neutrino models. We also find that interesting neutrino mass textures are realized by assigning fields to family-dependent elements in the algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete Lagrangian describing axion interactions with pseudoscalar and (axial-)vector mesons within the three light-flavor quark framework. This formulation incorporates both the standard chiral Lagrangian and the full Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term. By including instanton effects associated with the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry, we demonstrate that physical observables remain invariant under arbitrary chiral phase rotations of the quark fields. This comprehensive Lagrangian provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring axion phenomenology through its interactions with mesons and gauge bosons. As a demonstration, we compute the decay widths of GeV-scale axions into various mesonic final states for several benchmark axion models.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>The QCD scalar susceptibility and thermal scalar resonances in chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent results on the role of thermal resonances in chiral symmetry restoration, we show that a description of the QCD scalar susceptibility at finite temperature $T$ saturated by the thermal properties of the lightest scalar resonance, the $f_0(500)$, is compatible both with lattice QCD data at nonzero $T$ and with the $T=0$ light resonance properties coming from experimental data. The thermal $f_0(500)$ is generated within the framework of Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. This method allows us to achieve a good description of lattice QCD results with a reliable pion mass dependence. In particular, we perform direct fits to the chiral susceptibility measured in lattice data at different pion masses and temperatures, obtaining a remarkable agreement for the susceptibility and for mass differences of the light quark condensate. In addition, the fitted low-energy constants are compatible with $T=0$ phenomenology. Our results confirm the role of unitarized approaches and thermal resonances in the dynamics of the QCD transition.</description>

      <title>A Common Origin of Asymmetric Self-interacting Dark Matter and Dirac Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and neutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed baryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{R_i},\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\chi$, a doublet fermion $\psi$, and heavy scalar doublets $\eta_i,\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. A global $B-L$ is imposed to protect the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Both $\chi$ and $\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed, where the singlets $\chi$, $\nu_R$, and $\eta$ are negative and the doublet $\psi$ is positive. The CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\eta$ generates an equal and opposite $B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\nu_R$) neutrinos. The $\nu_L-\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until below the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings. During this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher than 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed neutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector mediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and self-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the Standard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive quasi-collinear factorization formulas in generic spontaneously broken gauge theories with scalars, fermions, and vector bosons. Specifically, we obtain polarized leading-order splitting functions for all possible final-state and initial-state 1-&gt;2 processes in the considered gauge theory. The main complication lies in the presence of mass-singular terms in longitudinal polarization vectors, prohibiting the direct application of the usual factorization procedure known from Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics. We overcome this issue with two different strategies, using gauge invariance and Ward identities as guiding principle. Our derivations do not use any explicit component-wise parametrizations of momenta and wave functions and bear no reference to a particular Lorentz frame. Furthermore, our results are valid for completely general definitions of the spin reference axes of the individual external particles. The various massless limits, the special case of the Electroweak Standard Model, the reproduction of existing literature results, and symmetry relations among our splitting functions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Two-particle cumulant distribution: a probe of "true" elliptic flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have shown the two-particle correlations of charged hadrons in d-Au collisions at 200 GeV. These correlations were studied at different multiplicities and pseudorapidity intervals. The two-particle correlations arise due to Color Reconnections, resonance decays, jet correlations, and hadronic rescattering. These correlations are inversely proportional to multiplicity but remain unaffected for larger pseudorapidity windows. We treated these correlations as distributions and calculated their skewness and kurtosis. The non-flow distributions deviate greatly from a Gaussian distribution and have high skewness and kurtosis. The "true" elliptic flow distributions resemble Gaussian distributions; they have significantly lower skewness and kurtosis. We suggest that if the two-particle cumulant flow is treated as an event-by-event distribution, its skewness and kurtosis can be instrumental in distinguishing true flow and non-flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that events with 6 or more top quarks may be observed at the LHC if certain particles exist at the TeV scale. In a model where a vectorlike quark of charge 2/3 decays into a top quark and a pseudoscalar particle, which subsequently decays into a top-antitop pair, the LHC production cross section for events with 6 top quarks may be above 10 fb. If the pseudoscalar is part of a complex scalar field, then longer cascade decays, involving the scalar partner, may lead to events with 8 or even 10 top quarks. We show that for a region of parameter space the dominant LHC signal in this model is 8 top quarks (i.e., four $t\bar t $ pairs). The ensuing signals would be spectacular, including many leptons and $b$ jets. A discovery in that case would allow several cross section measurements that may determine the masses of all three new particles.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

      <title>Microscopic calculation of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange currents in $^{40}$Ar and asymmetric scaling properties for neutrino and electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of two particle-two hole meson exchange current response functions in asymmetric nuclei, with particular emphasis on the $^{40}$Ar nucleus. Employing a relativistic mean-field and relativistic Fermi gas framework, we compute the nuclear response for $^{40}$Ar and compare it with that of the symmetric $^{40}$Ca nucleus, analyzing the role of proton-neutron imbalance. The model incorporates distinct proton and neutron Fermi momenta to accurately capture the nuclear dynamics of systems with $Z \neq N$. Our results indicate that using $^{40}$Ca as a proxy for $^{40}$Ar leads to a systematic error of approximately 10\%. Additionally, we propose an asymmetric scaling formula to obtain the 2p2h response for arbitrary nuclei from the $^{12}$C response, improving the description of asymmetric nuclei. Finally, we benchmark our predictions against inclusive electron scattering and neutrino cross sections.</description>

      <title>Diabatic Dynamical Diquark Model of Hidden-Strangeness Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize our recent analysis of hidden-strangeness tetraquarks within the dynamical diquark model from its adiabatic form (in which each state is described solely by a diquark-antidiquark potential) to its diabatic form (which incorporates effects of di-hadron thresholds upon the states). We tabulate all relevant thresholds and compute the di-hadron content of each predicted state. Our results produce no particular hidden-strange tetraquark candidate whose structure is dominated by di-hadron structure, in contrast to the charm sector, where many exotic states are strongly associated with such thresholds: The hidden-strange states tend to remain compact and less influenced by di-hadron thresholds. Multiple states above 2~GeV with peculiar decay properties, including $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and $\eta(2370)$, continue to serve as excellent hidden-strange tetraquark candidates.</description>

Abstract: Theories of flavor operate at various scales. Recently it has been pointed out that in the context of modular flavor symmetries certain combinations of observables are highly constrained, or even uniquely fixed, by modular invariance and holomorphicity. We find that even in the absence of supersymmetry these combinations are surprisingly immune against quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Discrete flavour and CP symmetries in light of JUNO and neutrino global fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working within the reference three-neutrino mixing framework, we confront the lepton mixing predictions derived using non-Abelian discrete flavour and CP symmetries with the first JUNO data on the solar neutrino mixing parameters $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and with the results of the latest global neutrino data analysis. We focus on symmetry breaking patterns for which the lepton PMNS mixing matrix depends only on one or two free real parameters. Performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in each of the considered cases, we report the best fit values, the $3\sigma$ C.L. allowed ranges and the $\chi^2$-distributions of the lepton mixing observables - the three mixing angles and the three CP-violation phases. We find that the JUNO measurements can disfavour or rule out a number of the mixing patterns associated with specific types of breaking of the discrete flavour and CP symmetries. The synergy of JUNO, DUNE and T2HK data can provide an exhaustive test of the considered approach to lepton mixing based on non-Abelian discrete lepton flavour symmetries combined with the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Diquark size effects in the quark-diquark approximation for baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryons can be described within several theoretical frameworks. Among them, the constituent approach is widely used. In this context, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of a particular model of baryons: the quark-diquark approximation. It consists in separating the three-body system into two subsequent two-body ones: a pair of two quarks, the diquark, and a second system consisting of the diquark and the third quark. This approximation is widely used, but its accuracy is rarely evaluated. The goal of this work is to perform this evaluation by comparing the quark-diquark model with a three-body model, both using the same semi-relativistic interaction. The baryon masses and some characteristic distances are computed and analysed within both approaches. Additionally, an original procedure to establish the quark-diquark potential will be presented with the aim to increase the precision of this approximation. It is shown that a diquark must not necessarily be compact to obtain good baryon masses.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate particle production by a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) in spontaneous baryogenesis, focusing on large initial misalignment angles. Our analysis confirms the established cubic dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the initial phase for small angles. However, this scaling breaks down for larger angles, with particle production saturating as the initial phase approaches ${\pi}$ in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) arises generically in scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model that have dark sectors with light mediators or strong dynamics. The self-interactions allow energy and momentum transport through halos, altering their structure and dynamics relative to those produced by collisionless dark matter. SIDM models provide a promising way to explain the diversity of galactic rotation curves, and they form a predictive and versatile framework for interpreting astrophysical phenomena related to dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the physical effects of dark matter self-interactions in objects ranging from galactic satellites (dark and luminous) to clusters of galaxies and the large-scale structure. The second major part describes the methods used to constrain SIDM models including current constraints, with the aim of advancing tests with upcoming galaxy surveys. This part also provides a detailed review of the unresolved small-scale structure formation issues and concrete ways to test simple SIDM models. The review is rounded off by a discussion of the theoretical motivation for self-interactions, degeneracies with baryonic and gravitational effects, extensions to the single-component elastic-interactions SIDM framework, and future observational and theoretical prospects.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large Ricci scalar, assumed to be constant and larger than the square of the Starobinsky mass. Moving to the Einstein frame, the model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. We quantize the scalar field showing the appearing of a mass gap through a Higgs-like solution. The presence of the mass gap, that increases with the square root of the Ricci scalar, shows how the effect of the scalar sector at low-energy becomes ineffective, making it relevant only at short distances.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, the Bardeen and the Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to be vital for exploring complex dynamics in many-body quantum systems. Thus, validating established results on current quantum computers is essential for evaluating their future utility. Hence, we investigate the entanglement entropy of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, in current IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Structure of renormalization constants for theories with multiple couplings in the MS-like subtraction schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For theories with multiple couplings we construct simple expressions for the four-dimensional (or, in general, integer-dimensional) renormalization constants assuming that all divergences are logarithmical. These expressions allow relating all coefficients at $\varepsilon$-poles, logarithms, and (if exist) mixed terms to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in any order of the perturbation theory for MS-like renormalization prescriptions. The result admits such a formulation in that $\varepsilon$-poles and $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ enter on the same footing. For theories with two and three couplings we present explicit expressions for the pole/logarithm structure of renormalization constants in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory. They are verified by comparisons with the two-loop explicit calculation for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED and also with the previously known three-loop calculations for the $\varphi^4$-theory with two couplings.</description>

Abstract: We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our "Ni\~nas At\'omicas" workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</description>

Abstract: The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</description>
