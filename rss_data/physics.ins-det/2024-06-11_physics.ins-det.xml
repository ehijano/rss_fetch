      <title>Decay energy spectrometry for improved nuclear material analysis at the iaea nml</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay energy spectrometry (DES) is a novel radiometric technique for high-precision analysis of nuclear materials. DES employs the unique thermal detection physics of cryogenic microcalorimeters with ultra-high energy resolution and 100$\%$ detection efficiency to accomplish high precision decay energy measurements. Low-activity nuclear samples of 1 Bq or less, and without chemical separation, are used to provide elemental and isotopic compositions in a single measurement. Isotopic ratio precisions of 1 ppm - 1,000 ppm (isotope dependent), which is close to that of the mass spectrometry, have been demonstrated in 12-hour DES measurements of ~5 Bq samples of certified reference materials of uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu). DES has very different systematic biases and uncertainties, as well as different sensitivities to nuclides, compared to mass-spectrometry techniques. Therefore, the accuracy and confidence of nuclear material assays can be improved by combining this new technique with existing mass-spectrometry techniques. Commercial-level DES techniques and equipment are being developed for the implementation of DES at the Nuclear Material Laboratory (NML) of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to provide complementary measurements to the existing technologies. The paper describes details of DES measurement methods, as well as DES precision and accuracy to U and Pu standard sources to discuss its capability in analysis of nuclear safeguards samples.</description>

      <title>A General Track Fit based on Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an analytical solution for a general three-dimensional track fit based on hit triplets. Input to the fit are triplet parameters, which contain information about the triplet geometry (hit positions), the radiation length of the material and the magnetic field. The general fit considers spatial hit and multiple Coulomb scattering uncertainties, and can also be extended to include energy losses.
  The output of the fit, which is given by an analytical closed-form solution, contains the total momentum and the hit residuals, including the full covariance matrix, thus allowing for easy software alignment of the detector. The fit qualities are calculated for the global track fit as well as for the local hit triplets. This feature allows filtering out triplets with poor fit quality at an early stage of track reconstruction. The fit of local triplets is fully parallelizable, enabling accelerated computation with parallel hardware architectures.
  The triplet track fit is detector-independent, making it possible to use the same fitting code for all tracking detectors. Only the detector-specific triplet parameters (fit input) depend on the triplet geometries and the magnetic field. Formulas for the calculation of the triplet parameters are given for the most common tracking detector setups, namely a homogeneous magnetic field and a spectrometer using a dipole magnet. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented to calculate tracking parameters for an arbitrary magnetic field configuration.
  Moreover, this work includes a discussion of track fit biases and presents an extension of the fit to include energy losses. Last but not least, it is proposed to use triplet-based scale parameters that characterize different tracking regimes to accelerate track fits and to optimize the design of future tracking detectors.</description>

      <title>Single channel PICOSEC Micromegas detector with improved time resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents design guidelines and experimental verification of a single-channel PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) detector with an improved time resolution. The design encompasses the detector board, vessel, auxiliary mechanical parts, and electrical connectivity for high voltage (HV) and signals, focusing on improving stability, reducing noise, and ensuring signal integrity to optimize timing performance. A notable feature is the simple and fast reassembly procedure, facilitating quick replacement of detector internal components that allows for an efficient measurement strategy involving different detector components. The paper also examines the influence of parasitics on the output signal integrity. To validate the design, a prototype assembly and three interchangeable detector boards with varying readout pad diameters were manufactured. The detectors were initially tested in the laboratory environment. Finally, the timing performance of detectors with different pad sizes was verified using a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) beam test. Notably, a record time resolution for a PICOSEC Micromegas detector technology with a CsI photocathode of 12.5$\pm$0.8 ps was achieved with a 10 mm diameter readout pad size detector.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the light yield of He:CF$_4$ based gaseous detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment aims to build a large ($\mathcal{O}(10)$ m$^3$) directional detector for rare event searches, such as nuclear recoils (NRs) induced by dark matter (DM), such as weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs). The detector concept comprises a time projection chamber (TPC), filled with a He:CF$_4$ 60/40 scintillating gas mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, equipped with an amplification stage made of a stack of three gas electron multipliers (GEMs) which are coupled to an optical readout. The latter consists in scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras and photomultipliers tubes (PMTs). The maximisation of the light yield of the amplification stage plays a major role in the determination of the energy threshold of the experiment. In this paper, we simulate the effect of the addition of a strong electric field below the last GEM plane on the GEM field structure and we experimentally test it by means of a 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ readout area prototype. The experimental measurements analyse stacks of different GEMs and helium concentrations in the gas mixture combined with this extra electric field, studying their performances in terms of light yield, energy resolution and intrinsic diffusion. It is found that the use of this additional electric field permits large light yield increases without degrading intrinsic characteristics of the amplification stage with respect to the regular use of GEMs.</description>

      <title>Spatial resolution improvements with finer-pitch GEMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) are used in many particle physics experiments, employing their 'standard' configuration with amplification holes of 140 um pitch in a hexagonal pattern. However, the collection of the charge cloud from the primary ionisation electrons from the drift region of the detector into the GEM holes affects the position information from the initial interacting particle. In this paper, the results from studies with a triple-GEM detector with an X-Y-strip readout anode are presented. It is demonstrated that GEMs with a finer hole pitch of here 90 um improve the detector's spatial resolution. Within these studies, also the impact of the front-end electronics on the spatial resolution was investigated, which is briefly discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Remote Reactor Ranging via Antineutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antineutrinos from nuclear reactors have the potential to be used for reactor monitoring in the mid- to far-field under certain conditions. Antineutrinos are an unshieldable signal and carry information about the reactor core and the distance they travel. Using gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detectors for this purpose has been previously proposed alongside rate-only analyses. As antineutrinos carry information about their distance of travel in their energy spectrum, the analyses can be extended to a spectral analysis to gain more knowledge about the detected core. Two complementary analyses are used to evaluate the distance between a proposed gadolinium-doped water-based liquid scintillator detector and a detected nuclear reactor. Example cases are shown for a detector in Boulby Mine, near the Boulby Underground Laboratory in the UK, and six reactor sites in the UK and France. The analyses both show strong potential to range reactors, but are limited by the detector design.</description>

      <title>A biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for detection of antibodies in human plasma for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study proposes a new efficient wireless biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for the detection of antibodies in human plasma, aiming at the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The biosensor was functionalized with the N antigen - nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Validation analyses, by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the selectivity and effective surface functionalization of the biosensor. The research successfully obtained, expressed and purified the recombinant antigen, while plasma samples from COVID-19 positive and negative patients were used to test the performance of the biosensor. A comparison of performance with the ELISA method revealed equivalent diagnostic power. These results indicate the robustness of the biosensor in reliably differentiating between positive and negative samples, highlighting its potential as an efficient and low-cost tool for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to being fast to execute and having the potential for automation in large-scale diagnostic studies, the biosensor fills a significant gap in existing SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards a RAG-based Summarization Agent for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity and sheer volume of information encompassing documents, papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.</description>
