      <title>Measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, in air-filter samples from Seville (2001-2002)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the last nuclear atmospheric test carried out by the People Republic of China in 1980 and since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the plutonium hasn't been directly released into the atmosphere. However, nowadays, it is still present in the troposphere. This is due to plutonium-bearing soil particles physical resuspension processes. In this work, we study for the first time the temporal variation of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, baseline concentrations on a monthly basis in surface air from Seville (Spain), and their correlation with some tracers of mineral dust, during 2001 and 2002. The Pu analyses were performed by low-energy Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The 239Pu plus 240Pu (239+240Pu) activity levels achieved maximums during the summer period, characterized by the absence of rains, and minimums during the rainy seasons, laying in the range 1-20 nBq per cubic meter. The 240Pu/239Pu two-year average atomic ratio was 0.18(0.03), in agreement with the fallout plutonium. A good correlation with Pu and Al and Ti levels is observed. They are crustal components usually used as tracers of African dust over European countries. The hypothesis of the influence of the Saharan dust intrusions is supported as well through the study of Total Ozone Mass Spectrometer (TOMS) daily images.</description>

      <title>Learning low-dimensional representations of ensemble forecast fields using autoencoder-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations often produce high-dimensional gridded data that is challenging to process for downstream applications. A prime example is numerical weather prediction, where atmospheric processes are modeled using discrete gridded representations of the physical variables and dynamics. Uncertainties are assessed by running the simulations multiple times, yielding ensembles of simulated fields as a high-dimensional stochastic representation of the forecast distribution. The high-dimensionality and large volume of ensemble datasets poses major computing challenges for subsequent forecasting stages. Data-driven dimensionality reduction techniques could help to reduce the data volume before further processing by learning meaningful and compact representations. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are typically designed for deterministic and single-valued inputs, and thus cannot handle ensemble data from multiple randomized simulations. In this study, we propose novel dimensionality reduction approaches specifically tailored to the format of ensemble forecast fields. We present two alternative frameworks, which yield low-dimensional representations of ensemble forecasts while respecting their probabilistic character. The first approach derives a distribution-based representation of an input ensemble by applying standard dimensionality reduction techniques in a member-by-member fashion and merging the member representations into a joint parametric distribution model. The second approach achieves a similar representation by encoding all members jointly using a tailored variational autoencoder. We evaluate and compare both approaches in a case study using 10 years of temperature and wind speed forecasts over Europe. The approaches preserve key spatial and statistical characteristics of the ensemble and enable probabilistic reconstructions of the forecast fields.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Station-Keeping of Short Duration High Altitude Balloons using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Station-Keeping short-duration high-altitude balloons (HABs) in a region of interest is a challenging path-planning problem due to partially observable, complex, and dynamic wind flows. Deep reinforcement learning is a popular strategy for solving the station-keeping problem. A custom simulation environment was developed to train and evaluate Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for short-duration HAB agents in the simulation. To train the agents on realistic winds, synthetic wind forecasts were generated from aggregated historical radiosonde data to apply horizontal kinematics to simulated agents. The synthetic forecasts were closely correlated with ECWMF ERA5 Reanalysis forecasts, providing a realistic simulated wind field and seasonal and altitudinal variances between the wind models. DQN HAB agents were then trained and evaluated across different seasonal months. To highlight differences and trends in months with vastly different wind fields, a Forecast Score algorithm was introduced to independently classify forecasts based on wind diversity, and trends between station-keeping success and the Forecast Score were evaluated across all seasons.</description>
