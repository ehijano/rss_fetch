      <title>Selected non-orthogonal configuration interaction with compressed single and double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing both dynamic and static correlation accurately is a primary goal in electronic structure theory. Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is a versatile tool for treating static correlation, offering chemical insights by combining diverse reference states. Nevertheless, achieving quantitative accuracy requires the inclusion of missing dynamic correlation. This work introduces a framework for compressing orthogonal single and double excitations into an NOCI of a much smaller dimension. This compression is repeated with each Slater determinant in a reference NOCI, resulting in another NOCI that includes all its single and double excitations (NOCISD), effectively recovering the missing dynamic correlations from the reference. This compressed NOCISD is further refined through a selection process using metric and energy tests (SNOCISD). We validate the effectiveness of SNOCISD through its application to the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule and the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model at various interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Towards Large-Scale AFQMC Calculations: Large Time Step Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report modifications of the ph-AFQMC algorithm that allow the use of large time steps and reliable time step extrapolation. Our modified algorithm eliminates size-consistency errors present in the standard algorithm when large time steps are employed. We investigate various methods to approximate the exponential of the one-body operator within the AFQMC framework, distinctly demonstrating the superiority of Krylov methods over the conventional Taylor expansion. We assess various propagators within AFQMC and demonstrate that the Split-2 propagator is the optimal method, exhibiting the smallest time-step errors. For the HEAT set molecules, the time-step extrapolated energies deviate on average by only 0.19 kcal/mol from the accurate small time-step energies. For small water clusters, we obtain accurate complete basis-set binding energies using time-step extrapolation with a mean absolute error of 0.07 kcal/mol compared to CCSD(T). Using large time-step ph-AFQMC for the N$_2$ dimer, we show that accurate bond lengths can be obtained while reducing CPU time by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Extended Donnan model for ion partitioning in charged nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membranes consist of pores and the walls of these pores are often charged. In contact with an aqueous solution, the pores fill with water and ions migrate from solution into the pores until chemical equilibrium is reached. The distribution of ions between outside and pore solution is governed by a balance of chemical potential, and the resulting model is called a Donnan theory, or Donnan equation. Including a partitioning coefficient that does not depend on salt concentration results in an extended Donnan equation `of the first kind'. Recently, an electrostatic model was proposed for ions in a pore based on the arrangement of ions around strands of polymer charge, including also ion activity coefficients in solution. That framework leads to an extended Donnan equation `of the second kind', which has extra factors depending on ion concentrations in the pores and salt concentration in solution. In the present work, we set up another Donnan model of the second kind by evaluating the Coulombic interactions of ions in a cylindrical pore, including the interaction of ions with the charged pore walls and between the ions. We assume that counterions are near the pore wall while coions distribute over the center region. Starting from a complete analysis, we arrive at an elegant expression for the chemical potential of ions in such a pore. This expression depends on coion concentration, pore size, and other geometrical factors, but there is no additional dependence on counterion concentration and charge density. This model predicts the Coulombic contribution to the chemical potential in the pore to be small, much smaller than predicted by the electrostatic model from literature. Instead, we predict that up to around 1 M salt concentration, activity effects of ions in solution are more important.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state-selected Carbon Astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of individual quanta of rotational excitation to a molecule has been shown to markedly change its reactivity by significantly modifying the intermolecular interactions. So far, it has only been possible to observe these rotational effects in a very limited number of systems due to lack of rotational selectivity in chemical reaction experiments. The recent development of rotationally controlled molecular beams now makes such investigations possible for a wide range of systems. This is particularly crucial in order to understand the chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium, such as exploring the formation of carbon-based astrochemical molecules and the emergence of molecular complexity in interstellar space from the reaction of small atomic and molecular fragments.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them (\textit{e.g.}, as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>

      <title>Coupling Polyatomic Molecules to Lossy Nanocavities: Lindblad versus Schr\"odinger description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage of cavities to impact molecular structure and dynamics has become popular. As cavities, in particular plasmonic nanocavities, are lossy and the lifetime of their modes can be very short, their lossy nature must be incorporated into the calculations. The Lindblad master equation is commonly considered as an appropriate tool to describe this lossy nature. This approach requires the dynamics of the density operator and is thus substantially more costly than approaches employing the Schr\"odinger equation for the quantum wave function when several or many nuclear degrees of freedom are involved. In this work we compare numerically the Lindblad and Schr\"odinger descriptions discussed in the literature for a molecular example where the cavity is pumped by a laser. The laser and cavity properties are varied over a range of parameters. It is found that the Schr\"odinger description adequately describes the dynamics of the polaritons and emission signal as long as the laser intensity is moderate and the pump time is not much longer than the lifetime of the cavity mode. Otherwise, it is demonstrated that the Schr\"odinger description gradually fails. The results are discussed and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Isostructural Softening of Vulcanized Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a previous work evidencing that short poly-propylene glycol (PPG) chains incorporated to crude SBR-silica nanocomposites act as filler-network softeners without changing their structure, we propose in the present letter to examine more operative cross-linked materials. We first evidence that the adsorption of PPG onto silica deactivates progressively the particle's catalytic effect on vulcanization, without perturbing however the cross-link density distribution that we investigate through multiple-quantum NMR. In addition, electron microscopy confirms that silica structure is conserved after vulcanization and that it does not depend on the PPG content either. Composites containing various amount of PPG can thus be seen as structurally identical, both from a matrix and filler point of view - which is confirmed by small and medium amplitude oscillation shear rheology showing strikingly identical viscoelastic properties. PPG signature only appears above 100% in tensile deformation where it is seen to soften dramatically the filler network. Our discovery makes it consequently possible to decorrelate the mechanical behavior of reinforced rubbers under normal conditions of use and urgent needs of energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Model for Polymer Electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are promising candidates for use in next-generation high-voltage batteries, as they possess advantageous elastic and electrochemical properties. However, PEs still suffer from low ionic conductivity and need to be operated at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the wide variety of different types of PEs and the complexity of the internal interactions constitute challenging tasks for progressing towards a systematic understanding of PEs. Here, we present a continuum transport theory which enables a straight-forward and thermodynamically consistent method to couple different aspects of PEs relevant for battery performance. Our approach combines mechanics and electrochemistry in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and is based on modeling the free energy, which comprises all relevant bulk properties. In our model, the dynamics of the polymer-based electrolyte are formulated relative to the highly elastic structure of the polymer. For validation, we discuss a benchmark polymer electrolyte. Based on our theoretical description, we perform numerical simulations and compare the results with data from the literature. In addition, we apply our theoretical framework to a novel type of single-ion conducting PE and derive a detailed understanding of the internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning across Different Chemical Domains: Virtual Screening of Organic Materials with Deep Learning Models Pretrained on Small Molecule and Chemical Reaction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming a preferred method for the virtual screening of organic materials due to its cost-effectiveness over traditional computationally demanding techniques. However, the scarcity of labeled data for organic materials poses a significant challenge for training advanced machine learning models. This study showcases the potential of utilizing databases of drug-like small molecules and chemical reactions to pretrain the BERT model, enhancing its performance in the virtual screening of organic materials. By fine-tuning the BERT models with data from five virtual screening tasks, the version pretrained with the USPTO-SMILES dataset achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.94 for three tasks and over 0.81 for two others. This performance surpasses that of models pretrained on the small molecule or organic materials databases and outperforms three traditional machine learning models trained directly on virtual screening data. The success of the USPTO-SMILES pretrained BERT model can be attributed to the diverse array of organic building blocks in the USPTO database, offering a broader exploration of the chemical space. The study further suggests that accessing a reaction database with a wider range of reactions than the USPTO could further enhance model performance. Overall, this research validates the feasibility of applying transfer learning across different chemical domains for the efficient virtual screening of organic materials.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Cost Four-Component Relativistic Unitary Coupled Cluster Method for Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a four-component relativistic unitary coupled cluster method for molecules. We have used commutator-based non-perturbative approximation using the ''Bernoulli expansion'' to derive an approximation to the relativistic unitary coupled cluster method. The performance of the full quadratic unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles method \left ( qUCCSD \right ), as well as a perturbative approximation variant \left ( UCC3 \right ), has been reported for both energies and properties. It can be seen that both methods give results comparable to those of the standard relativistic coupled cluster method. The qUCCSD method shows better agreement with experimental results due to better inclusion of the relaxation effects. A natural spinor-based scheme to reduce the computation cost of relativistic UCC3 and qUCCSD methods has been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact exchange and correlation contributions are known to crucially affect electronic states, which in turn govern covalent bond formation and breaking in chemical species. Empirically averaging the exact exchange admixture and the amount of correlation over configurational and compositional degrees of freedom, hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) have been widely successful, yet have fallen short to reach explicitly correlated high level quantum chemistry accuracy in general. Using quantum machine learning, we have adaptified hybrid DFAs by generating optimal admixture ratios of exact exchange or of correlation "on the fly", specifically for any chemical compound. Adaptive exchange in the PBE0 hybrid DFA yields atomization energies sufficiently accurate to effectively cure the infamous spin gap problem in DFT, and also improves electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in organic molecules. Using adaptive PBE0, we revised the entire QM9 data set presenting more accurate quantum properties that include, on average, stronger covalent binding, larger band-gaps, more localized electron densities, and slightly larger dipole-moments. Adaptive PBE correlation (in conjunction with 100% HF exchange) also affords much improved atomization energies, and even enables covalent bond dissociation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are compatible with current technology.</description>
