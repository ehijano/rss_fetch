      <title>The conditional probabilities and the empirical laws in a free scalar QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike QFT in Minkowski spacetime (QFTM), QFT in curved spacetime (QFTCS) suffers from a conceptual obscurity on the empirical (experimentally verifiable/falsifiable) laws. We propose to employ the notion of prior conditional probabilities to describe a part of the empirical laws of QFTCS. This is interpreted as a quantum conditional probability without no information on the initial state. Hence this notion is expected to be free from the inevitable vagueness of the empirical meaning of quantum states in QFTCS. More generally in quantum physics, this notion seems free from the conceptual problems on state reductions. We confine ourselves to the probabilistic laws of the free scalar fields (Klein-Gordon fields) in curved spacetime, which require some reconsideration on the empirical meaning of the canonical commutation relation (CCR). We give some examples of empirical laws in terms of prior conditional probabilities, concerning the CCR and the free scalar QFTCS.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Three-Dimensional Stationary Gas Dynamics Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the three-dimensional stationary equations of a polytropic gas and employs symmetry methods to construct exact analytical solutions. In the Chaplygin gas case, the analysis yields a highly general solution family depending on three arbitrary functions, while the general adiabatic index formulation admits explicit solutions parameterized by several constants.</description>

      <title>Mathematical results for the nonlinear Winter's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Winter's nonlinear model has been adopted in theoretical physics as the prototype for the study of quantum resonances and the dynamics of observables in the context of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. However, its mathematical treatment still has several important gaps. This article demonstrates a dispersive estimate of the evolution operator, from which the result of local well-posedeness of the solution follows; a criterion for the existence of the blow-up phenomenon is also provided. Finally, the phenomenon of bifurcations of stationary solutions is analysed, concluding with a conjecture on the orbital stability of some of them.</description>

      <title>Subcriticality at High Temperatures in Spin Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new sufficient conditions for subcriticality of classical and quantum spin lattice systems, formulated in terms of the uniqueness of Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states. This is achieved by exploiting a non-commutative analog of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations together with a novel decomposition of local observables. In contrast to standard approaches \cite{Bratteli_Robinson_97,Frohlich_Ueltschi_2015}, our condition is uniform with respect to the dimension of the single-site Hilbert space. Moreover, unlike the results of \cite{Drago_Pettinari_Van_de_Ven_2025}, which required control over the growth of the derivatives of the interaction potentials, our result only involves estimating the natural $C^*$-norm of these potentials. This substantially enlarges the class of interactions for which the theorems apply and provides better lower bounds on the subcritical inverse temperature. Finally, our results are flexible enough to cover situations where no assumptions are imposed on the single-site potentials.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates and long-time validity for Bogoliubov dynamics of interacting Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Bogoliubov approximation for the many-body quantum dynamics of weakly interacting Bose gases and establish a uniform-in-time validity of the Bogoliubov theory. The proof relies on a detailed analysis of the dispersive behavior of the symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics, which allows for a rigorous derivation of the Bogoliubov theory as an effective description of quantum fluctuations around the Bose-Einstein condensate on all time scales.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the program on connecting Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) quantization with index theories of algebraic type. We explain how the classical algebraic index theorem can be proved in terms of BV quantization of topological quantum mechanics. This is generalized to 2d chiral CFT in which we present an elliptic chiral analog of the algebraic index theory. As an application, we show how the generating function of all genus Gromov-Witten invariants on elliptic curves is mirror equivalent to an elliptic chiral index in the mirror BCOV theory.</description>

      <title>The evolution operator connecting the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms for contact systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some mechanical systems with dissipation can be described within the framework of the so-called contact mechanics: a modified form of the Euler-Lagrange equations stemming from Herglotz's variational principle, which admits a geometric formulation in terms of contact geometry. On the other hand, the study of singular Lagrangian systems and Dirac's theory of constraints can be enhanced by using the evolution operator $K$ that connects the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms.
  The main purpose of this paper is to transpose this evolution operator to the case of contact mechanics, and to study some of its main properties. In particular, we show that it provides a geometric description of the evolution equations and it relates the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian constraints. To illustrate the theory, we provide examples of singular contact systems based on modified versions of the simple pendulum and the Cawley Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Rate of Convergence for Translation-Invariant 1D Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of translation-invariant discrete-time quantum dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice. We prove that the cumulative distributions function of the ballistically scaled position $\mathbb X(n)/{n}$ after $n$ steps converges at a rate of $n^{-1/3}$ in the L\'evy metric as $n\to\infty$. In the special case of step-coin quantum walks with two-dimensional coin space, we recover the same convergence rate for the supremum distance and prove optimality.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A few comments on (hyper)k\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we make two methodical observations.
  $\bullet$ We prove in a simple explicit way that a necessary and sufficient condition for a K\"ahler manifold to be hyperk\"ahler is $h_{i\bar k} h_{j\bar l } \Omega^{\bar k \bar l} \ =\ C \Omega_{ij}$, where $h_{i\bar k}$ is a complex metric, $\Omega$ is a symplectic matrix and $C$ is a positive constant.
  $\bullet$ The procedure of K\"ahler reduction includes two stages. On the first stage, a K\"ahler manifold of dimension $2n$ is reduced to a $(2n-1)$ - dimensional manifold, while on the second stage, one arrives at a K\"ahler manifold of dimension $2(n-1)$. We note that this second stage has the meaning of Hamiltonian reduction. We illustrate the procedure by discussing a simple toy model when $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ is reduced down to $S^2$. We elucidate also hyperk\"ahler reduction of $\mathbb{R}^7 \times S^1$ down to the Taub-NUT metric.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Black Hole S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality between the classical XXX spin chain and the rational reduced Gaudin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large $N$ limit of the spectral duality between the classical $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ XXX spin chain and the $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ trigonometric Gaudin model in its rational reduced form. The infinite-dimensional limit of the Gaudin model is constructed within the framework of the noncommutative torus algebra, following the approach of Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen. In this formulation, the matrix dynamical variables are promoted to fields on the torus, and the corresponding Lax equations acquire the Moyal star-product structure. The dual model is obtained as the large $N$ limit of the $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ classical XXX spin chain with $N$ sites, represented by Laurent series satisfying a quadratic $r$-matrix relation associated with the rational solution of the classical Yang--Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Bessel-Hagen on the extension of Noether's theorems and their application to classical electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the 1921 article by Erich Bessel-Hagen entitled \"Uber die Erhaltungss\"atze der Elektrodynamik ("On the conservation laws of electrodynamics"). The article is based on Noether's theorems, which were formulated by Emmy Noether in 1918 and concern consequences of symmetries of actions, including conservation laws. Bessel-Hagen firstly extends Noether's theorems to symmetries up to a divergence and next applies them to the n-body problem and to classical electromagnetism, especially to its conformal symmetries. The work explains the context in which Bessel-Hagen's article was written, the way his explanations proceeded and the significance of his results. It is argued in particular that Bessel-Hagen's article as much as Noether's are best considered as elements of Felix Klein's Erlangen programme. A close reading of Bessel-Hagen's text is also provided, as is its comparison with relevant works, including recent works by philosophers of physics Katherine Brading, Harvey Brown and Peter Holland. Such an approach helps to see where Bessel-Hagen's treatment is confused and to clarify it, as well as to estimate the advancement in our understanding of the relevant topics made within the last one hundred years.</description>

      <title>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \] in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a function $f$ are established, together with a method for its construction.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators, and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</description>

Abstract: We give a realization $\mathcal{A}_0$ of quantum toroidal algebra associated to $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ which can be viewed as an affinization of the Drinfeld new realization of quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$. We use this realization to define an affinization $\mathcal{A}_N$, $N\in{\mathbb Z}$, of shifted quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$. We construct a large family of representations of dominantly shifted algebra $\mathcal A_N$, $N&gt;0$. The examples of representations with even positive $N$ appear in the study of extensions of deformed $W$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{gl}(N+2|1)$.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the moment of inertia for harmonically trapped noninteracting Bosons at finite temperature: large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the full probability distribution of the moment of inertia $I \propto \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i^{\,2}$ of a gas of $N$ noninteracting bosons trapped in a harmonic potential $V(r) = (1/2)\, m\, \omega^2 r^2$, in all dimensions and at all temperature. The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\to \infty$ and $\omega\to 0$ with their product $\rho = N \omega^d$ fixed, where $\rho$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d&gt;1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $\rho$ crosses a critical value $\rho_c(\beta)$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_\beta(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_\beta(I,N) \sim e^{-V \Phi(I/V)}$ where $V = \omega^{-d} \gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $\Phi(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $\rho &lt; \rho_c(\beta)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d&gt;1$. This provides a real space diagnostic for the BEC transition in the noninteracting Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Cayley--Hamilton Theorem for Orthogonal Quantum Matrix Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a family of the orthogonal $O(k)$ type Quantum Matrix algebras we establish an analogue of the Cayley--Hamilton theorem. The form of the Cayley-Hamilton identity is different in three cases. First, the cases of odd ($k=2\ell -1$) and even ($k=2\ell$) heights are different. Second, for even height orthogonal Quantum Matrix algebra we derive two versions of the Cayley--Hamilton theorem, one for its positive component $O^+(2\ell)$ and another one for the negative component $O^-(2\ell)$. In each case we introduce the spectral parameterization of the coefficients of the Cayley--Hamilton identity by the `eigenvalues' of the quantum matrices.</description>

      <title>On the distribution patterns of zeros for random polynomials with regularly varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotic distribution of complex zeros of random polynomials $P_n(z):=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b(k)\xi_k z^k$, as $n\to\infty$, where $b$ is a regularly varying function at infinity with index $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ and $(\xi_k)_{k\geq 0}$ is a sequence of independent copies of a complex-valued random variable $\xi$. The limiting distribution of zeros both inside and outside the unit disk is determined assuming $\mathbb{E}[\log^{+}|\xi|]&lt;\infty$. Under the additional assumptions $\mathbb{E}[\xi]=0$ and $\mathbb{E}[|\xi|^2]&lt;\infty$, local universality results for zeros near the boundary of the unit disk are established. Notably, it is shown that the point process of zeros undergoes a transition from liquid-like to crystalline phases as $\alpha$ crosses the critical value $\alpha_c = -1/2$ from right to left. In the liquid phase ($\alpha &gt; \alpha_c$), the limiting point process of zeros is universal. In the crystalline phase, it is universal if and only if $\alpha = \alpha_c$ and $\sum_k b^2(k) = +\infty$ (the weak crystalline phase), and non-universal when $\sum_k b^2(k) &lt; +\infty$ (the strong crystalline phase). The zeros of the so-called random self-inversive polynomials on the unit circle exhibit a similar phase transition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multiparameter Quantum Estimation of Magnonic Couplings in a Magnomechanical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an experimentally viable scheme to enhance the simultaneous estimation precision of the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, with a particular focus on the performance of heterodyne detection. By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cram\'er Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a version of stable maps into the classifying stack $B\mathrm{GL}_N$, and develop a corresponding notion of $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. In this setting, the evaluation morphisms are not of finite type; the definition of the $K$-theoretic invariants proceeds by constructing a stability stratification of the moduli stack. In the absence of markings, the semistable locus of the stratification recovers moduli spaces of bundles on nodal curves considered by Gieseker, Nagaraj-Seshadri, Schmitt and Kausz.
  We also define versions of stable maps into quotient stacks of the form $Z/\mathrm{GL}_N$, where $Z$ is a projective $\mathrm{GL}_N$-scheme. We construct corresponding stability stratifications, whose semistable loci provide new proper moduli spaces of gauged maps from a varying nodal curve into $Z/\mathrm{GL}_N$.</description>

      <title>Stability of intrinsic localized modes on the lattice with competing power nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with competing powers (p,q) satisfying 2 &lt;= p &lt; q. The physically relevant cases are given by (p,q) = (2,3), (p,q) = (3,4), and (p,q) = (3,5). In the anticontinuum limit, all intrinsic localized modes are compact and can be classified by their codes, which record one of two nonzero (smaller and larger) states and their sign alternations. By using the spectral stability analysis, we prove that the codes for larger states of the same sign are spectrally and nonlinearly (orbitally) stable, whereas the codes for smaller states of the alternating signs are spectrally stable but have eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. We also identify numerically the spectrally stable codes which consist of stacked combinations of the sign-definite larger states and the sign-alternating smaller states.</description>

      <title>The Ginibre Ensemble Conditioned on an Overcrowding Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre Ensemble of random matrices consisting of $N$ eigenvalues. We study the event that for $ {c \in [0,1]}$, $\lfloor cN \rfloor$ of the eigenvalues are located outside of a disk of radius $ R \in (\sqrt{1-c},1)$. Except for the case $c=1$ the eigenvalue process conditioned on this event is not determinantal. Nevertheless we are able to obtain asymptotic estimates of the probability of the event, and describe the conditional distribution in three spatial regions. For $ \{ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} : \big| \lambda \big| &lt;R\}, \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : \big| \lambda \big| &gt; R+\epsilon\} $ the conditional distribution is asymptotically that of a Ginibre ensemble. Meanwhile, near the boundary of the disk, after rescaling by a factor of order $ N$, it tends to the determinantal point process that appears in the limit of the Ginibre ensemble near a hard wall in Seo arXiv:2010.08818 [math-ph] .</description>

      <title>Orientations of Orbi-K-Theory measuring Topological Phases and Brane Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Chern phases of quantum materials, as well as brane charges on M-theory orbifolds, have famously been argued to be classified by (orbi) topological K-theory, or possibly by other stable and, notably, complex-oriented cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology or Morava K-theory.
  However, closer inspection reveals that the most fine-grained "fragile" microscopic classification in both cases is in (orbi) Cohomotopy, which is the primordial "unstable" or nonabelian generalized cohomology. Coarsening takes the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an nonabelian cohomology operations. But what then is the role of complex orientation on the stable side?
  We observe here (i) that over gapped nodal lines in the 2D Brillouin torus and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges lift through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (ii) that measuring this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal complex/quaternionic orientation on stable cohomology in four/ten dimensions!
  Then we give an explicit realization of such unstable four/ten-dimensional complex/quaternionic orientation in U(2)/Sp(2)-equivariant K-theory, using real division-algebraic tools within a new model of twisted orbifold K-theory in cohesive homotopy theory; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from orbi Cohomotopy-twisted Cohomotopy to relative orbi K-theory.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the classification of 2-band crystalline topological insulator phases sensitive to the topology in the gapping process of their nodal line semimetal parent phase, and to the measurement of M-string charges inside M5-brane probes.</description>

      <title>Pulsation of quantum walk between two arbitrary graphs with weakly connected bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Grover walk on a finite graph composed of two arbitrary simple graphs connected by one edge, referred to as a bridge. The parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $\epsilon=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $\epsilon$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $\epsilon$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived. This expression reveals that the pulsation depends solely on the number of edges in each graph, regardless of their structure. In addition, we obtain that the quantum walker is transferred periodically between the two graphs, with a period of order $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, when the number of edges of two graphs is equal, the quantum walker is almost completely transferred.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically circularly polarized bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric periodic structures, near which resonant states approach ideal circularly polarized states (CPSs). We term these BICs {\em asymptotically circularly polarized BICs} ({\em acp}-BICs) and identify two types: single-angle and all-angle. Single-angle {\em acp}-BICs permit convergence to left- or right-handed CPSs only along a single momentum-space direction, whereas all-angle {\em acp}-BICs exhibit convergence to CPSs of a single handedness throughout the entire momentum space, rendering them exceptionally promising for chiral optical applications. We reveal that the existence of {\em acp}-BICs is underpinned by total reflection of circularly polarized waves.
  Moreover, all-angle {\em acp}-BICs qualify as super-BICs, with uniform nearby polarization being an intrinsic property.
  In addition, a bifurcation theory is developed to analyze the emergence of genuine CPSs from {\em acp}-BICs
  under $C_{2}$-symmetric structural perturbations.
  Our results suggest {\em acp}-BICs as a platform for singular and chiral optical responses in all-dielectric systems.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity and Regular Black Hole Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of spacetime singularities, regions of infinite curvature where classical physics breaks down, is one of the most profound challenges in General Relativity (GR). In particular, black hole solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics feature central singularities that signal the incompleteness of the theory in high curvature regimes. This thesis is devoted to the study of modified theories of gravity that aim to resolve these singularities and construct physically viable models of regular black holes: black holes that retain an event horizon but exhibit no curvature divergence anywhere in the spacetime ... Throughout the thesis, particular care is taken to ensure that the proposed models are physically sensible: they reduce to GR in the appropriate limits and lead to well behaved curvature scalars. Collectively, these results highlight the viability of regular black hole models in modified gravity theories, providing a promising path toward a consistent semiclassical description of black holes that avoids the need for quantum gravitational resolution of singularities.

      <description>arXiv:2511.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a GPU-accelerated variational framework with exact projection onto the Lowest Landau Level to probe vortex patterns in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. For repulsive interactions, our approach faithfully reproduces Abrikosov vortex lattices, achieving quantitative alignment with Thomas-Fermi theory and the Abrikosov constant, while underscoring the profound analogy between superfluid vortex ordering and Abrikosov lattices in type-II superconductors. In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Emulation of the Six-State Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Pulsed Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography remains a topic of enduring scientific and educational interest. Here, we present a clear and accessible framework for exploring the six-state quantum key distribution protocol, an enhanced three-basis extension of the BB84 scheme that combines optical experiments with computational analysis. Designed for testing quantum communication protocols through emulation, this approach provides a robust and cost-effective platform that highlights the fundamental principles of multi-basis encoding and demonstrates how experimental measurements connect directly to theoretical expectations in a controlled tabletop setting.</description>

      <title>A sharp commutator estimate for all Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a functional inequality in any dimension controlling the derivative along a transport of the Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.
  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\mathsf{d}-2\le \mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of Lie conformal algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lie conformal algebroids (LCAd) and their representations using the language of lambda-brackets and Lie conformal algebras. We describe several general constructions, such as the LCAd of conformal derivations CDer(A) of a differential algebra A, the gauge LCAd G(A,M) associated to a differential algebra A and its module M, the current LCAd F^ of a Lie algebroid F, and the LCAd structure of the space Omega(V) of Kahler differentials over a Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) V. We develop the cohomology theories of LCAd and we relate them to the corresponding cohomology theories of PVA. In particular, we find an isomorphism between the cohomology of a PVA V with coefficients in a module M and the corresponding cohomology of the LCAd Omega(V) with coefficients in the same module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a surface observable for nonabelian four-dimensional $BF$ theory with a cosmological term. The surface observable yields new $2$-knot invariants that may extend beyond known examples such as the Alexander invariant. By BV pushforward, the surface observable induces an electric observable in nonabelian Yang-Mills theory, offering a concrete realization of 't~Hooft operators. An application to self-dual Yang-Mills theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Learning Mixed Unitary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning mixed unitary channels using Fisher information, under different quantum resource assumptions including ancilla and concatenation. Our result shows that the asymptotic sample complexity scales as $\frac{r}{d\varepsilon^2}$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel (i.e.\ the number of different unitaries), $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $\varepsilon^2$ is the mean-square error. Thus the critical resource is the ancilla, which mirrors the result in~\cite{chen2022quantum} but in a more precise form, as we point out that $r$ is also important. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical potential of mixed unitary channels by showing that random mixed unitary channels are easy to learn.</description>

      <title>A Turbulent Fluid Mechanics Via Nonlinear Mixing Of Smooth Velocity Flows With Reynolds-Weighted Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a finite-volume domain $\mathfrak{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of size $\mathrm{Vol}(\mathfrak{D})\sim \mathrm{L}^{3}$ containing a viscous fluid of kinematic viscosity $\nu$ with velocity field $U_{a}(x,t)$ satisfying the Navier--Stokes equations with prescribed boundary data. We introduce a zero-centred homogeneous-isotropic Gaussian field $\mathscr{B}(x)$ on $\mathfrak{D}$ with Bargmann--Fock correlation $\mathbb{E}\langle\mathscr{B}(x)\otimes\mathscr{B}(y)\rangle=\mathsf{C}\exp(-|x-y|^{2}\lambda^{-2})$, where $\lambda\le \mathrm{L}$. For the volume-averaged Reynolds number $\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)=(|\mathrm{Vol}(\mathfrak{D})|^{-1}\int_{\mathfrak{D}}|U_{a}(x,t)|d\mu(x))\mathrm{L}/\nu$, let $\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})$ denote the critical threshold for turbulence. We propose a Reynolds-weighted mixing ansatz for a turbulent velocity field
  \[\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)=U_{a}(x,t)+\alpha U_{a}(x,t)\psi(|\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)-\mathbf{Re}_{c}(\mathfrak{D})|)\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{S}}[\mathbf{Re}(\mathfrak{D},t)]\mathscr{B}(x)\]
  with $\alpha\ge 1$, $\psi$ monotone increasing, and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{S}}$ active only for $\mathbf{Re}&gt;\mathbf{Re}_{c}$. The construction preserves the mean flow, $\mathbb{E}\langle\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)\rangle=U_{a}(x,t)$, while allowing turbulence intensity to grow with the control parameter $\mathbf{Re}$. This provides a tentative stochastic closure for Navier--Stokes, enabling Reynolds-type correlations $\mathsf{T}_{ab}(x,y;t)=\mathbb{E}\langle\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)\otimes\mathscr{U}_{b}(y,t)\rangle$ and higher moments. For test functions $f$ and curves $\Im\subset\mathfrak{D}$ we define a Hopf-like functional
  \[\mathbb{H}[\mathscr{U}_{a},t]=\mathbb{E}\bigg\langle\exp\bigg(i\int_{\Im}f(x,t)\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)dx^{a}\bigg)\bigg\rangle\]
  encoding circulation statistics generated by the mixing ansatz.</description>

      <title>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the infinite random Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain exhibits localization phenomena, such as spectral, eigenstate, and weak dynamical localization, in an arbitrary (but fixed) energy interval in a non-trivial region of the parameter space. This region depends only on the energy interval and includes weak interaction and strong disorder regimes. The crucial step in the argument is a proof that if the Green functions for the associated finite systems Hamiltonians exhibit certain (volume-dependent) decay properties in a fixed energy interval, then the infinite volume Green function decays in the same interval as well. The pertinent finite systems decay properties for the random XXZ spin chain had been previously verified by the authors.</description>

With certain boundary conditions, we rigorously and precisely characterize the essential spectrum and show how it splits from the portion of the spectrum corresponding to the acoustic modes. The fundamental mathematical tools in our analysis are a generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition and the Lopantinskii conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the convergence of Feynman graph integrals on closed real-analytic K\"ahler manifolds and uncover the structural mechanism underlying this convergence. The key insight is that, using Getzler's rescaling technique, the graph integrands extend canonically to the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of configuration spaces as forms with divisorial-type singularities. This allows the Feynman graph integrals to be rigorously defined as Cauchy principal value integrals. As an application, these integrals provide a mathematically rigorous construction of the higher-genus B-model invariants on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the sense of Bershadsky-Cecotti-Ooguri-Vafa (BCOV).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric and analytical extension of the Finsler--Ginzburg--Landau framework by introducing a distributed control field acting as a translation in the tangent bundle. Within this formulation, the classical Tonelli Lagrangian is deformed into a control--translated Finsler structure, whose Legendre dual induces a uniformly elliptic operator and a convex energy functional preserving the essential variational features of the anisotropic model. This approach provides a rigorous analytical setting for coupling external control fields with the intrinsic Finsler geometry of anisotropic superconductors. The study establishes the convexity, coercivity, and regularity properties of the induced energy functional and proves the existence of controlled minimizers through variational arguments on admissible configurations. In the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter tends to zero, a detailed $\Gamma$--convergence analysis yields a renormalized energy $W_u$ governing vortex interactions under control translation, quantifying the modification of the Green kernel and the self-energy due to the field $u(x)$. The results demonstrate that the control translation preserves the underlying Finsler structure while introducing a new geometric degree of freedom for manipulating and stabilizing vortex configurations.</description>

Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and present symmetric ghost Lagrange densities for the coupling of General Relativity to Yang--Mills theories. The graviton-ghost is constructed with respect to the linearized de Donder gauge fixing condition and the gauge ghost with respect to the covariant Lorenz gauge fixing condition. Both ghost Lagrange densities together with their accompanying gauge fixing Lagrange densities are obtained from the action of the diffeomorphism and gauge super-BRST differential -- which we define as the composition of the BRST differential with its anti-BRST differential -- on suitable gauge fixing bosons. In addition, we introduce a total gauge fixing boson and show that the complete symmetric ghost and gauge fixing Lagrange density can be generated thereof using the total super-BRST differential. In particular, we generalize two earlier approaches for flat-spacetime Yang--Mills theories to General Relativity and covariant Yang--Mills theories: The original approach by Curci and Ferrari (1976), using the Faddeev--Popov method on non-linear gauge fixings, and the modern approach by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg (1982), using BRST and anti-BRST symmetries with gauge fixing bosons.</description>

      <title>Currently there are no reasons to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis: The zeta function beyond the realm of computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine published arguments which suggest that the Riemann Hypothesis may not be true. In each case we provide evidence to explain why the claimed argument does not provide a good reason to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis. The evidence we cite involves a mixture of theorems in analytic number theory, theorems in random matrix theory, and illustrative examples involving the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices. Similar evidence is provided for four mistaken notions which appear repeatedly in the literature concerning computations of the zeta-function. A fundamental question which underlies some of the arguments is: what does the graph of the Riemann zeta-function look like in a neighborhood of its largest values? We explore that question in detail and provide a survey of results on the relationship between L-functions and the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. We highlight the key role played by the emergent phenomenon of carrier waves, which arise from fluctuations in the density of zeros. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to understand some aspects of the zeta function at large heights, but the computation evidence is misleading.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of degrees for lattice equations: a singularity approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of degree growth and algebraic entropy plays a crucial role in the field of discrete integrable systems. However, a general method for calculating degree growth for lattice equations (partial difference equations) is not yet known. Here we propose a method to rigorously compute the exact degree of each iterate for lattice equations. Halburd's method, which is a novel approach to computing the exact degree of each iterate for mappings (recurrence relations, typically from ordinary difference equations) from the singularity structure, forms the basis of our idea. The strategy is to extend this method to lattice equations. First, we illustrate, without rigorous details, how to calculate degrees for lattice equations using the lattice version of Halburd's method, and outline the issues that must be resolved to make the method rigorous. We then provide a framework to ensure that all calculations are accurate and rigorous. We further address how to detect the singularity structure in lattice equations. Our method is not only accurate and rigorous but can also be easily applied to a wide range of lattice equations.</description>

      <title>Completeness Relation in Renormalized Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space. We finally give an interesting application for sudden perturbation of the support of the delta potential.</description>

      <title>Genus two KdV soliton gases and their long-time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper employs the Riemann-Hilbert problem to provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the high-genus Korteweg-de Vries soliton gases. It is demonstrated that the two-genus soliton gas is related to the two-phase Riemann-Theta function as \(x \to +\infty\), and approaches to zero as \(x \to -\infty\). Additionally, the long-time asymptotic behavior of this two-genus soliton gas can be categorized into five distinct regions in the \(x\)-\(t\) plane, which from left to right are rapidly decay, modulated one-phase wave, unmodulated one-phase wave, modulated two-phase wave, and unmodulated two-phase wave. Moreover, an innovative method is introduced to solve the model problem associated with the high-genus Riemann surface, leading to the determination of the leading terms, which is also related with the multi-phase Riemann-Theta function. A general discussion on the case of arbitrary \(N\)-genus soliton gas is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>Rational Solutions of Painlev\'e V from Hankel Determinants and the Asymptotics of Their Pole Locations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function to a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation. More specifically, we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots asymptotically fill a region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity and the other parameters are kept fixed. Moreover, we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet energy and focusing NLS condensates of minimal intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of (poly)continua $\K$ in the upper half-plane ${\mathbb H} $ that contain a preassigned finite {\it anchor} set $E\in\mathbb H$. For a given harmonic external field we define a Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ and show that within each ``connectivity class'' of the family, there exists a minimizing compact $\mathcal K^*$ consisting of critical trajectories of a quadratic differential. In many cases this quadratic differential coincides with the square of the real normalized quasimomentum differential ${\rm d} {\bf p}$ associated with the finite gap solutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (fNLS) defined by a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\mathfrak R$ branched at the points $E\cup\bar E$.
  The motivation for this work lies in the problem of soliton condensate of least average intensity such that a given anchor set $E$ belongs to the poly-continuum $\mathcal K$. An fNLS soliton condensate is defined by a compact $\mathcal K\subset{\mathbb H} $ (its spectral support) whereas the average intensity of the condensate is proportional to $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$. We prove that the spectral support $\mathcal K^*$ provides the fNLS soliton condensate of the least average intensity within a given ``connectivity class''.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Complete Minimal Form Factors for Irrelevant Deformations of Integrable Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal form factors (MFFs) of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by generalized $T\bar{T}$ perturbations. Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are constructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue that plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of the standard integral representation which has been used for UV-complete theories since the birth of the form factor bootstrap program. By UV-complete we mean theories whose short-distance/high-energy limit is a local conformal field theory. Their asymptotics is characterized by exponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form factors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the cancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption that the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation, remain unchanged in the presence of $T\bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong. There is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and asymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor equations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor equations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are essential assumptions.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization (GS) in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators, an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. Besides the SL, we considered a generalization of regular oscillators to higher dimensions and also the Lorenz model as a prototype of chaotic oscillators. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for GS to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to have global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the resurgent structure of the topological string dual to 2d $U(N)$ Yang-Mills on torus. We find closed form formulas for instanton amplitudes up to arbitrarily high instanton orders, based on which we propose the non-perturbative partition function including contributions from all the real instantons, which is real for positive modulus and string coupling. We also explore complex instantons and find two infinite towers of them. We expect them to correspond to BPS states in type II string.</description>

Abstract: We discuss free differential algebras (FDA's), a generalization of the Cartan-Maurer equations for the group manifold vielbein, appropriate for theories containing $p$-forms ($p &gt;1$). Their dual formulation is an extension of Lie algebras, called $L_\infty$ algebras, and we illustrate this duality in a simple example. Finally we review the FDA structure and the dual $L_\infty$ structure of $d=11$ supergravity.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact, purely geometric account of the interior dynamics of Schwarzschild black holes, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of additional charges beyond the total mass ${\cal M}$. We show that dynamical evolution generically produces new singularities, absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>Competition of small targets in planar domains: from Dirichlet to Robin and Steklov boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a bounded planar domain with multiple small targets on a smooth boundary. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these targets for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on the targets. We start from the classical problem of splitting probabilities for perfectly reactive targets with Dirichlet boundary condition and improve some earlier results. We discuss how this approach can be generalized to partially reactive targets characterized by a Robin boundary condition. In particular, we show how partial reactivity reduces the effective size of the target. In addition, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-target limit. Finally, we show how our asymptotic approach can be extended to interior targets in the bulk and to exterior problems where diffusion occurs in an unbounded planar domain outside a compact set. Direct applications of these results to diffusion-controlled reactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for quasi-periodic Jacobi block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for discrete quasiperiodic Jacobi $d\times d$ block matrices with Diophantine frequencies. The H\"older exponent is shown to be any $\beta$ such that $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/(2\kappa^d)$, where $\kappa^d$ is the acceleration, i.e., the slope of the sum of the top $d$ Lyapunov exponents in the imaginary direction of the phase. This generalizes the H\"older continuity results in the Schr\"odinger operator setting in \cites{GS2,HS1}, and also strengthens them in that setting by covering more Diophantine frequencies. The proof is built on a new scheme for obtaining a local zero count for finite-volume characteristic polynomials from a global one.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>
