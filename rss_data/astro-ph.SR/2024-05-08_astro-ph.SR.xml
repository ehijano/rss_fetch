      <title>Starspots and Undetected Binary Stars Have Distinct Signatures in Young Stellar Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red-optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.</description>

      <title>Validation of EUHFORIA cone and spheromak Coronal Mass Ejection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present the validation results for arrival times and geomagnetic impact of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), using the cone and spheromak CME models implemented in EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). Validating numerical models is crucial in ensuring their accuracy and performance with respect to real data.
  Methods. We compare CME plasma and magnetic field signatures, measured in situ by satellites at the L1 point, with the simulation output of EUHFORIA. The validation of this model was carried out by using two datasets in order to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. The first dataset focuses on 16 CMEs that arrived at the Earth, offering specific insights into the model's accuracy in predicting arrival time and geomagnetic impact. Meanwhile, the second dataset encompasses all CMEs observed over eight months within Solar Cycle 24, regardless of whether they arrived at Earth, covering periods of both solar minimum and maximum activity. This second dataset enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive precision in term of CME arrivals and misses.
  Results. Our results show that EUHFORIA provides good estimates in terms of arrival times, with root mean square errors (RMSE) values of 9 hours. Regarding the number of correctly predicted ICME arrivals and misses, we find a 75% probability of detection in a 12 hours time window and 100% probability of detection in a 24 hours time window. The geomagnetic impact forecasts, measured by the $K_p$ index, provide different degrees of accuracy, ranging from 31% to 69%. These results validate the use of cone and spheromak CMEs for real-time space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Astrometric and photometric characterization of $\eta$ Tel B combining two decades of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\eta$ Tel is an 18 Myr system with a 2.09 M$_{\odot}$ A-type star and an M7-M8 brown dwarf companion, $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 4.2'' (208 au). High-contrast imaging campaigns over 20 years have enabled orbital and photometric characterization. $\eta$ Tel B, bright and on a wide orbit, is ideal for detailed examination.
  We analyzed three new SPHERE/IRDIS coronagraphic observations to explore $\eta$ Tel B's orbital parameters, contrast, and surroundings, aiming to detect a circumplanetary disk or close companion. Reduced IRDIS data achieved a contrast of 1.0$\times 10^{-5}$, enabling astrometric measurements with uncertainties of 4 mas in separation and 0.2 degrees in position angle, the smallest so far.
  With a contrast of 6.8 magnitudes in the H band, $\eta$ Tel B's separation and position angle were measured as 4.218'' and 167.3 degrees, respectively. Orbital analysis using Orvara code, considering Gaia-Hipparcos acceleration, revealed a low eccentric orbit (e $\sim$ 0.34), inclination of 81.9 degrees, and semi-major axis of 218 au. $\eta$ Tel B's mass was determined to be 48 \MJup, consistent with previous calculations.
  No significant residual indicating a satellite or disk around $\eta$ Tel B was detected. Detection limits ruled out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B with masses down to 1.6 \MJup at a separation of 33 au.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Transient Prominence Bubbles Driven by Erupting Mini-filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominence bubbles, the dark arch-shaped "voids" below quiescent prominences, are generally believed to be caused by the interaction between the prominences and the slowly-emerging or quasi-stable underlying magnetic loops. However, this scenario could not explain some short-lived bubbles with extremely dynamic properties of evolution. Based on high-resolution H$\alpha$ observations, here we propose that bubbles should be classified into two categories according to their dynamic properties: quasi-steady (Type-I) bubbles and transient (Type-II) bubbles. Type-I bubbles could remain relatively stable and last for several hours, indicating the existence of a quasi-stable magnetic topology, while Type-II bubbles grow and collapse quickly within one hour without stability duration, which are usually associated with erupting mini-filaments. Analysis of several typical Type-II bubbles from different views, especially including an on-disk event, reveals that Type-II bubbles quickly appear and expand at a velocity of $\thicksim$5--25 km s$^{-1}$ accompanied by an erupting mini-filament below. The mini-filament's rising velocity is slightly larger than that of the Type-II bubbles' boundary, which will lead to the collision with each other in a short time, subsequent collapse of Type-II bubbles, and formation of a large plume into the above prominence. We also speculate that only if the angle between the axis of the erupting mini-filament and the line-of-sight is large enough, the interaction between the erupting mini-filament and the overlying prominence could trigger a Type-II bubble with a typical arch-shaped but quickly-expanding bright boundary.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Constrained Ensemble Image Segmentation of Coronal Holes in Chromospheric Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Holes (CHs) are large-scale, low-density regions in the solar atmosphere which may expel high-speed solar wind streams that incite hazardous, geomagnetic storms. Coronal and solar wind models can predict these high-speed streams and the performance of the coronal model can be validated against segmented CH boundaries. We present a novel method named Sub-Transition Region Identification of Ensemble Coronal Holes (STRIDE-CH) to address prominent challenges in segmenting CHs with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imagery. Ground-based, chromospheric He I 10830 {\AA} line imagery and underlying Fe I photospheric magnetograms are revisited to disambiguate CHs from filaments and quiet Sun, overcome obscuration by coronal loops, and complement established methods in the community which use space-borne, coronal EUV observations. Classical computer vision techniques are applied to constrain the radiative and magnetic properties of detected CHs, produce an ensemble of boundaries, and compile these boundaries in a confidence map that quantifies the likelihood of CH presence throughout the solar disk. This method is science-enabling towards future studies of CH formation and variability from a mid-atmospheric perspective.</description>

      <title>The Catalog of early-type Runaway stars from LAMOST-DR8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway stars are OB-type stars ejected from their birthplace with large peculiar velocities. The leading hypothesis addressed in their formation includes the supernova ejection mechanism and the dynamic ejection scenario. Identification of runaway populations is the first step to investigating their formation and evolution. Here we present our work of searching for Galactic runaway candidate stars from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR8 database. After studying the kinematic properties for a collection of 4,432 early-type stars, predominantly B-type stars, using the radial velocity measurements from LAMOST DR8 and astrometric solutions made by Gaia DR3, we identified 229 runaway candidate stars. They span a wide distribution in projected rotational velocities. We investigated the Galactic spatial distribution of the runaway population and noticed that most of them likely reside within the Galactic thin disk. Based upon analyzing the Doppler shifts of the candidate stars, we found two binary runaway candidates displaying velocity variation with estimated orbital periods of 40 and 61 days.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength observations of a breakout jet at an active region periphery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed Interface-Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) observations of a small coronal jet that occurred at the solar west limb on 2014 August 29. The jet source region, a small bright point, was located at an active-region periphery and contains a fan-spine topology with a mini-filament. Our analysis has identified key features and timings that motivate the following interpretation of this event. As the stressed core flux rises, a current sheet forms beneath it; the ensuing reconnection forms a flux rope above a flare arcade. When the rising filament-carrying flux rope reaches the stressed null, it triggers a jet via explosive interchange (breakout) reconnection. During the flux-rope interaction with the external magnetic field, we observed brightening above the filament and within the dome, along with a growing flare arcade. EUV images reveal quasi-periodic ejections throughout the jet duration with a dominant period of 4 minutes, similar to coronal jetlets and larger jets. We conclude that these observations are consistent with the magnetic breakout model for coronal jets.</description>

      <title>Coronal modulation in the ultra-fast rotator LO Peg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present coronal imaging of the ultra-fast rotator, LO Peg, using the X-ray observations from XMM-Newton. The X-ray light curves show one strong flare at the end of observation, as reported in an earlier study. On removal of flaring events, the quiescent state light curve shows rotational modulations, which are modelled using a maximum likelihood model. The results obtained from modelling show the corona of LO Peg is not uniform. Active regions are concentrated around two longitudes, where one active region appears to be compact. The large coronal area that covers almost 60 degrees along longitude from the poles to the equator does not consist of active regions.</description>

      <title>EMISSA: Exploring millimetre indicators of solar-stellar activity III. Comparison of Ca II indices and millimetre continua in a 3D model atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ca II H &amp; K lines are strong chromospheric diagnostics that can be used to determine the temperature stratification and magnetic structure of the solar atmosphere. The Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) offers complementary information on the thermal structure of stellar atmospheres using mm continuum radiation. The overall aim is to establish more robust solar/stellar activity indicators using ALMA observations in comparison with classical diagnostics, such as the s index and infrared triplet (IRT) index. A study was conducted using 1.5D radiative transfer codes RH1.5D and advanced radiative transfer (ART), along with an enhanced network atmosphere model generated by the state-of-the-art 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamics (rMHD) Bifrost code, to compute synthetic spectra for both Ca II lines and mm continua. To account for the limited spatial resolution of ALMA, we simulated the effect using a Gaussian point spread function (PSF). Additionally, we analysed the correlations and slopes of scatter plots between the Ca II indices and mm continuum for the original and degraded resolutions, focusing on the entire simulation box, quiet Sun regions, and enhanced network patches separately. The activity indices generated from these lines could further be used to compare the spectra of Sun-like stars with the solar spectrum. The Ca II activity indices and mm brightness temperatures are weakly correlated at the high resolution, with the highest correlation observed at a wavelength of 0.3 mm, corresponding to ALMA band 10. As the resolution decreases, the correlation consistently increases. Conversely, the slopes exhibit a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength, while the degradation of resolution does not noticeably affect the calculated slopes. Consequently, these relationships could be valuable for calibrating the mm continuum maps obtained through ALMA observations.</description>

      <title>Cepheids as distance indicators and stellar tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the phenomenology of classical Cepheids (CCs), Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) and type II Cepheids (TIICs) in the Milky Way (MW) and in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs).
  We also examine the Hertzsprung progression in different stellar systems by using the shape of I-band light curves (Fourier parameters) and observables based on the difference in magnitude and in phase between the bump and the minimum in luminosity.
  The distribution of Cepheids in optical and in optical-near infrared (NIR) color--magnitude diagrams is investigated to constrain the topology of the instability strip. The use of Cepheids as tracers of young (CCs), intermediate (ACs) and old (TIICs) stellar populations are brought forward by the comparison between observations (MCs) and cluster isochrones covering a broad range in stellar ages and in chemical compositions.
  The different diagnostics adopted to estimate individual distances (period--luminosity, period--Wesenheit, period--luminosity--color relations) are reviewed together with pros and cons in the use of fundamental and overtones, optical and NIR photometric bands, and reddening free pseudo magnitudes (Wesenheit). We also discuss the use of CCs as stellar tracers and the radial gradients among the different groups of elements (iron, alpha, neutron-capture) together with their age-dependence.
  Finally, we briefly outline the role that near-future space and ground-based facilities will play in the astrophysical and cosmological use of Cepheids.</description>

      <title>A dusty rain falls on the nova V959 Monocerotis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present archival and ground-based infrared observations of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon, covering the period 100-4205 days after the 2012 eruption. We use these data to determine that the secondary in the nova system is a G5 main sequence star. Data from the NEOWISE survey reveal a significant increase in the emission at 3.4 microns and 4.6 microns at late (&gt;~600 days) times, which we interpret as emission by dust. Other interpretations are considered but cannot be reconciled with the data. The presence of such late dust emission, and in particular its variation with time, are unprecedented in the context of novae. The behaviour of the dust emission suggests a qualitative interpretation in which ejecta from the 2012 eruption encounter denser pre-eruption circumbinary material, giving rise to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that cause clumps of dust-bearing material to fall back towards the central binary, the dust undergoing destruction by chemisputtering as it does so. The observed rise in the dust temperature, the decline in the nova-dust distance and in the dust mass, are consistent with this interpretation. Not all novae are expected to show this behaviour, but inspection of resources such as NEOWISE might reveal other novae post-eruption that do.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Spin in the Intermediate Polar CC Sculptoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on spin variations in the intermediate polar and cataclysmic variable CC Scl, as seen by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). By studying both the spin period and its harmonic, we find that the spin has varied since it was first observed in 2011. We find the latest spin value for the source to be 389.473(6)s, equivalent to 0.00450779(7) days, 0.02s shorter than the first value measured. A linear fit to these and intermediate data give a rate of change of spin ~-4.26(2.66)e10^-11 and a characteristic timescale tau~2.90e10^5 years, in line with other known intermediate polars with varying spin. The spin profile of this source also matches theoretical spin profiles of high-inclination intermediate polars, and furthermore, appears to have changed in shape over a period of three years. Such `spin-up' in an intermediate polar is considered to be from mass accretion onto the white dwarf (the primary), and we note the presence of dwarf nova eruptions in this source as being a possible catalyst of the variations.</description>

      <title>Fast as Potoroo: Radio Continuum Detection of a Bow-Shock Pulsar Wind Nebula Powered by Pulsar J1638-4713</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06961v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (PWN), named Potoroo, and the detection of a young pulsar J1638-4713 that powers the nebula. We present a radio continuum study of the PWN based on 20-cm observations obtained from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and MeerKAT. PSR J1638-4713 was identified using Parkes radio telescope observations at frequencies above 3 GHz. The pulsar has the second-highest dispersion measure of all known radio pulsars (1553 pc/cm^3), a spin period of 65.74 ms and a spin-down luminosity of 6.1x10^36 erg/s. The PWN has a cometary morphology and one of the greatest projected lengths among all the observed pulsar radio tails, measuring over 21 pc for an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The remarkably long tail and atypically steep radio spectral index are attributed to the interplay of a supernova reverse shock and the PWN. The originating supernova remnant is not known so far. We estimated the pulsar kick velocity to be in the range of 1000-2000 km/s for ages between 23 and 10 kyr. The X-ray counterpart found in Chandra data, CXOU J163802.6-471358, shows the same tail morphology as the radio source but is shorter by a factor of 10. The peak of the X-ray emission is offset from the peak of the radio total intensity (Stokes I) emission by approximately 4.7", but coincides well with circularly polarised (Stokes V) emission. No infrared counterpart was found.</description>

      <title>The GALAH survey: Tracing the Milky Way's formation and evolution through RR Lyrae stars</title>

Abstract: Stellar mergers and accretion events have been crucial in shaping the evolution of the Milky Way (MW). These events have been dynamically identified and chemically characterised using red giants and main-sequence stars. RR Lyrae (RRL) variables can play a crucial role in tracing the early formation of the MW since they are ubiquitous, old (t$\ge$10 Gyr) low-mass stars and accurate distance indicators. We exploited Data Release 3 of the GALAH survey to identify 78 field RRLs suitable for chemical analysis. Using synthetic spectra calculations, we determined atmospheric parameters and abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca, Y, and Ba. Most of our stars exhibit halo-like chemical compositions, with an iron peak around [Fe/H]$\approx -$1.40, and enhanced Ca and Mg content. Notably, we discovered a metal-rich tail, with [Fe/H] values ranging from $-$1 to approximately solar metallicity. This sub-group includes almost ~1/4 of the sample, it is characterised by thin disc kinematics and displays sub-solar $\alpha$-element abundances, marginally consistent with the majority of the MW stars. Surprisingly, they differ distinctly from typical MW disc stars in terms of the s-process elements Y and Ba. We took advantage of similar data available in the literature and built a total sample of 535 field RRLs for which we estimated kinematical and dynamical properties. We found that metal-rich RRLs (1/3 of the sample) likely represent an old component of the MW thin disc. We also detected RRLs with retrograde orbits and provided preliminary associations with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Helmi, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and Thamnos stellar streams.</description>

      <title>SN2023fyq: A Type Ibn Supernova With Long-standing Precursor Activity Due to Binary Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a type Ibn supernova in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D$\simeq$18~Mpc). In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\sim$0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material ($\sim$0.3$\rm M_{\odot}$) at $\sim$3000$\rm R_{\odot}$ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid rising precursor emission within $\sim$30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core-collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from $-$10 to $-$13.</description>

      <title>An arcsecond view at 1-2 GHz into the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a high angular resolution (1.1") and sensitivity (maximum of ~0.1 mJy) radio survey at 1-2 GHz in the Galactic Bulge. This complements the X-ray Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey, and investigates the full radio source population in this dense Galactic region. Radio counterparts to sources at other wavelengths can aid in classification, as there are relatively few types of objects that are reasonably detectable in radio at kiloparsec distances, and even fewer that are detected in both X-rays and radio. This survey covers about 3 square degrees of the Galactic Bulge Survey area (spanning the Galactic coordinate range of -3deg &lt; l &lt; +3deg and +1.6deg &lt; b &lt; +2.1deg as a first look into this region of the Galaxy with this combination of frequency, resolution, and sensitivity. Spectral indices within the observed band of 1-2 GHz were calculated for each source to assist in determining its emission mechanism. We find 1617 unique sources in the survey, 25 of which are radio counterparts to X-ray sources, and about 100 of which are steep-spectrum (alpha &lt;~ -1.4) point sources that are viable pulsar candidates. Four radio sources are of particular interest: a compact binary; an infrared transient with an inverted radio spectrum; a potential transitional millisecond pulsar candidate; and a very steep spectrum radio source with an X-ray and bright infrared counterpart. We discuss other notable sources, including possible radio transients, potential new planetary nebulae, and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Does Metallicity affect Protoplanetary Disk Fraction? Answers from the Outer Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9-2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34-0.83 Z$_{\odot}$) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using $JHK$ data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2-2 M$_{\odot}$) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25-0.85 Z$_{\odot}$ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low-metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average $2.6\pm0.2$ times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in sub-solar metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3-1.4 and 1.4-2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.</description>

      <title>The dynamical age of the LMC globular cluster NGC 1835 using the "dynamical clock"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the study of the size-age relationship observed in star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the investigation of its origin, here we present the determination of the structural parameters and the dynamical age of the massive cluster NGC 1835. We have used a powerful combination of optical and near-ultraviolet images acquired with the WFC3 onboard the HST to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, determining the values of the core, half-mass and tidal radii through the comparison with the King model family. The same data also allowed us to evaluate the dynamical age of the cluster by using the 'dynamical clock'. This is an empirical method that quantifies the level of central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster half-mass radius by means of the A+ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. The results confirm that NGC 1835 is a very compact cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The estimated value of A+ ($0.30\pm 0.04$) is the largest measured so far in the LMC clusters, providing evidence of a highly dynamically evolved stellar system. NGC 1835 nicely fits into the correlation between A+ and the central relaxation time and in the anti-correlation between A+ and the core radius defined by the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud clusters investigated to date.</description>

      <title>DanceCam: atmospheric turbulence mitigation in wide-field astronomical images with short-exposure video streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to mitigate the adverse effects of atmospheric turbulence on astronomical imaging. Utilizing a video-to-image neural network trained on simulated data, our method processes a sliding sequence of short-exposure ($\sim$0.2s) stellar field images to reconstruct an image devoid of both turbulence and noise. We demonstrate the method with simulated and observed stellar fields, and show that the brief exposure sequence allows the network to accurately associate speckles to their originating stars and effectively disentangle light from adjacent sources across a range of seeing conditions, all while preserving flux to a lower signal-to-noise ratio than an average stack. This approach results in a marked improvement in angular resolution without compromising the astrometric stability of the final image.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic diffusion in the Chromosphere on the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects in the chromosphere on the solar wind by performing MHD simulations for Alfv\'en-wave driven winds with explicitly including Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. We find that MHD waves are significantly damped in the chromosphere by ambipolar diffusion so that the Alfv\'enic Poynting flux that reaches the corona is substantially reduced. As a result, the coronal temperature and the mass loss rate of the solar wind are considerably reduced, compared with those obtained from an ideal MHD case, which is indicative of a great importance of the non-ideal MHD effects in the solar atmosphere. However, the temperature and the mass loss rate are recovered by a small increase in the convection-originated velocity perturbation at the photosphere because of the sensitive dependence of the ambipolar diffusion and reflection of Alfv\'en waves on the physical properties of the chromosphere. We also find that density perturbations in the corona are reduced by the ambipolar diffusion of Alfv\'en waves in the chromosphere because the nonlinear generation of compressible perturbations is suppressed.</description>

      <title>PlatoSim: An end-to-end PLATO camera simulator for modelling high-precision space-based photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is the ESA M3 space mission dedicated to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets including information from the asteroseismic properties of their stellar hosts. The uninterrupted and high-precision photometry provided by space-borne instruments such as PLATO require long preparatory phases. An exhaustive list of tests are paramount to design a mission that meets the performance requirements, and as such, simulations are an indispensable tool in the mission preparation. To accommodate PLATO's need of versatile simulations prior to mission launch - that at the same time describe accurately the innovative but complex multi-telescope design - we here present the end-to-end PLATO simulator specifically developed for the purpose, namely PlatoSim. We show step-by-step the algorithms embedded into the software architecture of PlatoSim that allow the user to simulate photometric time series of CCD images and light curves in accordance to the expected observations of PLATO. In the context of the PLATO payload, a general formalism of modelling, end-to-end, incoming photons from the sky to the final measurement in digital units is discussed. We show the strong predictive power of PlatoSim through its diverse applicability and contribution to numerous working groups within the PLATO Mission Consortium. This involves the on-going mechanical integration and alignment, performance studies of the payload, the pipeline development and assessments of the scientific goals. PlatoSim is a state-of-the-art simulator that is able to produce the expected photometric observations of PLATO to a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate that PlatoSim is a key software tool for the PLATO mission in the preparatory phases until mission launch and prospectively beyond.</description>

      <title>HIP 65426 is a High-Frequency Delta Scuti Pulsator in Plausible Spin-Orbit Alignment with its Directly Imaged Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HIP 65426 hosts a young giant planet that has become the first exoplanet directly imaged with JWST. Using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we classify HIP 65426 as a high-frequency $\delta$ Scuti pulsator with a possible large frequency separation of $\Delta \nu =$7.23$\pm$0.02 cycles day$^{-1}$. We check the TESS data for pulsation timing variations and use the nondetection to estimate a 95% dynamical mass upper limit of 12.8 Mjup for HIP 65426 b. We also identify a low-frequency region of signal that we interpret as stellar latitudinal differential rotation with two rapid periods of 7.85$\pm$0.08 hr and 6.67$\pm$0.04 hr. We use our TESS rotation periods together with published values of radius and $v \sin{i}$ to jointly measure the inclination of HIP 65426 to $i_{\star}=107_{-11}^{+12}$$^\circ$. Our stellar inclination is consistent with the orbital inclination of HIP 65426 b ($108_{-3}^{+6}$$^{\circ}$) at the $68\%$ percent level based on our orbit fit using published relative astrometry. The lack of significant evidence for spin-orbit misalignment in the HIP 65426 system supports an emerging trend consistent with preferential alignment between imaged long-period giant planets and their host stars.</description>

      <title>Quantitative modelling of type Ia supernovae spectral time series: Constraining the explosion physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Empirical modelling tools have also been developed that allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe and direct comparisons between observations and explosion model predictions. Such tools have provided useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when performing quantitative spectral fitting and show that best-fitting models and parameters are highly dependent on the assumed weighting schemes and priors. As spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent manner.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Multi-filter UV to NIR Data-driven Light Curve Templates for Stripped Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the spectroscopic classification scheme for Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) is clear, and we know that they originate from massive stars that lost some or all their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium, the photometric evolution of classes within this family is not fully characterized. Photometric surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will discover tens of thousands of transients each night and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited, prompting the need for photometric classification and inference based solely on photometry. We have generated 54 data-driven photometric templates for SESNe of subtypes IIb, Ib, Ic, Ic-bl, and Ibn in U/u, B, g, V, R/r, I/i, J, H, Ks, and Swift w2, m2, w1 bands using Gaussian Processes and a multi-survey dataset composed of all well-sampled open-access light curves (165 SESNe, 29531 data points) from the Open Supernova Catalog. We use our new templates to assess the photometric diversity of SESNe by comparing final per-band subtype templates with each other and with individual, unusual and prototypical SESNe. We find that SNe Ibns and Ic-bl exhibit a distinctly faster rise and decline compared to other subtypes. We also evaluate the behavior of SESNe in the PLAsTiCC and ELAsTiCC simulations of LSST light curves highlighting differences that can bias photometric classification models trained on the simulated light curves. Finally, we investigate in detail the behavior of fast-evolving SESNe (including SNe Ibn) and the implications of the frequently observed presence of two peaks in their light curves.</description>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>
