      <title>Optimal Indoor AP Placement: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks in a room are strongly affected by interferences. To alleviate these effects and enhance the performance of the wireless networks, some optimization was carried out. In this work, an analytical study was introduced to determine the optimal number of access points with their positions on the ground floor at the Architecture Engineering department building - University of Mosul. The implementation has been done using a web-based Wi-Fi and IoT design tool called Hamina Network Planner, and a Wi-Fi Network Planning and Site Survey Software called NetSpot. The experimental results show that the simulation values of the available APs are approximately matched with the real time manual values, achieving the best rates of -22dBm and -31dBm respectively. However, the number of currently available Access Points is not sufficient to cover the building area, so that two scenarios were suggested to overcome this issue. In the first scenario, two access points have been added at different positions in the building depending on the Hamina Network Planner, and in the second one, the transmitted power has been increased. The simulation results demonstrate that the overall coverage rate enhanced and can include most of the building area.</description>

      <title>Routing Dynamics in Distributed Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum networks are not merely information conduits but intricate systems that embody the principles of quantum mechanics. In our study, we examine the underlying mechanisms of quantum connectivity within a distributed framework by exploring phenomena such as superposition and entanglement and their influence on information propagation. We investigate how these fundamental quantum effects interact with routing strategies that, while inspired by classical methods, must contend with quantum decoherence and measurement uncertainties. By simulating distributed networks of 10, 20, 50 and 100 nodes, we assess the performance of routing mechanisms through metrics that reflect both quantum fidelity and operational efficiency. Our findings reveal that the quantum coherence inherent in entangled states can enhance routing fidelity under specific conditions, yet also introduce challenges such as increased computational overhead and sensitivity to network scale. This work bridges the gap between the underlying principles of quantum systems and practical routing implementations, offering new insights into the design of robust distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Semantic Communications in Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</description>

      <title>When Next-Gen Sensing Meets Legacy Wi-Fi: Performance Analyses of IEEE 802.11bf and IEEE 802.11ax Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing is emerging as a vital future service in next-generation wireless networks, enabling applications such as object localization and activity recognition. The IEEE 802.11bf standard extends Wi-Fi capabilities to incorporate these sensing functionalities. However, coexistence with legacy Wi-Fi in densely populated networks poses challenges, as contention for channels can impair both sensing and communication quality. This paper develops an analytical framework and a system-level simulation in ns-3 to evaluate the coexistence of IEEE 802.11bf and legacy 802.11ax in terms of sensing delay and communication throughput. Forthis purpose, we have developed a dedicated ns-3 module forIEEE 802.11bf, which is made publicly available as open-source. We provide the first coexistence analysis between IEEE 802.11bfand IEEE 802.11ax, supported by link-level simulation in ns-3to assess the impact on sensing delay and network performance. Key parameters, including sensing intervals, access categories, network densities, and antenna configurations, are systematically analyzed to understand their influence on the sensing delay and aggregated network throughput. The evaluation is further extended to a realistic indoor office environment modeled after the 3GPP TR 38.901 standard. Our findings reveal key trade-offs between sensing intervals and throughput and the need for balanced sensing parameters to ensure effective coexistence in Wi-Fi networks.</description>

      <title>UniNet: A Unified Multi-granular Traffic Modeling Framework for Network Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern networks grow increasingly complex--driven by diverse devices, encrypted protocols, and evolving threats--network traffic analysis has become critically important. Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</description>

      <title>Temporal Analysis of NetFlow Datasets for Network Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets for machine learning (ML)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Although many previous studies have highlighted the critical role of temporal features, such as inter-packet arrival time and flow length/duration, in NIDS, the currently available NetFlow datasets for NIDS lack these temporal features. This study addresses this gap by creating and making publicly available a set of NetFlow datasets that incorporate these temporal features [1]. With these temporal features, we provide a comprehensive temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets by examining the distribution of various features over time and presenting time-series representations of NetFlow features. This temporal analysis has not been previously provided in the existing literature. We also borrowed an idea from signal processing, time frequency analysis, and tested it to see how different the time frequency signal presentations (TFSPs) are for various attacks. The results indicate that many attacks have unique patterns, which could help ML models to identify them more easily.</description>

      <title>Existence of Deadlock-Free Routing for Arbitrary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a network of routing nodes, represented as a directed graph, we prove the following necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of deadlock-free message routing: The directed graph must contain two edge-disjoint directed trees rooted at the same node, one tree directed into the root node and the other directed away from the root node.
  While the sufficiency of this condition is known, its necessity, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously recognized or proven. Although not directly applicable to the construction of deadlock-free routing schemes, this result provides a fundamental insight into the nature of deadlock-free networks and may lead to the development of improved tools for designing and verifying such schemes.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Inter-domain Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite efforts from cloud and content providers to lower latency to acceptable levels for current and future services (e.g., augmented reality or cloud gaming), there are still opportunities for improvement. A major reason that traffic engineering efforts are challenged to lower latency is that the Internet's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol, is oblivious to any performance metric, and circuitous routing is still pervasive.
  In this work, we propose two implementation modifications that networks can leverage to make BGP latency-aware and reduce excessive latency inflation. These proposals, latency-proportional AS prepending and local preference neutralization, show promise towards providing a method for propagating abstract latency information with a reasonable increase in routing overhead.</description>

      <title>InviCloak: An End-to-End Approach to Privacy and Performance in Web Content Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's web ecosystem, a website that uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) shares its Transport Layer Security (TLS) private key or session key with the CDN. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of InviCloak, a system that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a user and a website's private communications without changing TLS or upgrading a CDN. InviCloak builds a lightweight but secure and practical key distribution mechanism using the existing DNS infrastructure to distribute a new public key associated with a website's domain name. A web client and a website can use the new key pair to build an encryption channel inside TLS. InviCloak accommodates the current web ecosystem. A website can deploy InviCloak unilaterally without a client's involvement to prevent a passive attacker inside a CDN from eavesdropping on their communications. If a client also installs InviCloak's browser extension, the client and the website can achieve end-to-end confidential and untampered communications in the presence of an active attacker inside a CDN. Our evaluation shows that InviCloak increases the median page load times (PLTs) of realistic web pages from 2.0s to 2.1s, which is smaller than the median PLTs (2.8s) of a state-of-the-art TEE-based solution.</description>

      <title>Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations: The Observer Effect and its Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the propagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RIS, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies the fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges collectively. In particular, we examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system by considering its critical components and stringent conditions. The latter include: (a) two extremes of implementation complexity, represented by minimalist operation designs of two distinct HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We present empirical evidence that autonomous RISs remain promising under stringent conditions and outline research directions to deepen probe distortion understanding.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge General Intelligence via Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) has been instrumental in delivering real-time, localized services by leveraging the computational capabilities of edge networks. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) empowers EI to evolve into the next stage: Edge General Intelligence (EGI), enabling more adaptive and versatile applications that require advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, systematic exploration in this area remains insufficient. This survey delineates the distinctions between EGI and traditional EI, categorizing LLM-empowered EGI into three conceptual systems: centralized, hybrid, and decentralized. For each system, we detail the framework designs and review existing implementations. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance and throughput of various Small Language Models (SLMs) that are more suitable for development on edge devices. This survey provides researchers with a comprehensive vision of EGI, offering insights into its vast potential and establishing a foundation for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</description>
