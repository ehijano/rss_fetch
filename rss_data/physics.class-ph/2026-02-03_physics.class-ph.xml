      <title>Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariance from outer surfaces: Laplace-governed magnetization in the high-permeability limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetization of bodies in static fields is a textbook topic in electrodynamics, governed by Laplace equations with interface continuity (transmission) conditions. In the infinite-permeability limit, textbooks emphasize the quasi-equipotential interior and normality of the external field at the boundary, but leave the exterior largely uncharacterized. Here we identify a singular property that has not been explicitly stated in the existing literature: in this limit, the entire external magnetic response, including the external field distribution and all multipole moments, is determined solely by the outer surface geometry, independent of internal structure or deformation. Numerical simulations confirm this limiting property is well approximated under finite high-permeability conditions, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the lightweight design of magnetic devices such as flux concentrators. Since analogous Laplace transmission problems arise across physics, including heat conduction, electrostatic polarization, and acoustic scattering, this geometric invariance exhibits cross-disciplinary universality. Together with the quasi-equipotential property, it provides a complementary and essentially complete characterization of Laplace transmission problems in the infinite-permeability limit.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Acousto-Electric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a new perspective on the acousto-electric effect by deriving a wave equation for the acoustic field that is akin to Stokes 1845 viscous wave equation and in which the phonon-electron interaction provides the loss/gain term. We hope this new perspective may provide some insight into the workings of the acousto-electric effect, and we use it to build connections to other areas of research, in particular inertial motion superradiance and the Zel'dovich effect.</description>

      <title>Precise Computation of Forced Response Backbone Curves of Frictional Structures Using Analytical Hessian Tensor of Contact Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the forced vibration response of nonlinear mechanical systems with friction is critical for engineering applications. Accurately determining the backbone curve of resonance peaks is pivotal for the design of friction devices. However, the prediction of these curves is computationally challenging owing to the nonconservative and nonsmooth nature of friction nonlinearity. Although techniques such as damped nonlinear normal modes (dNNMs) and phase resonance methods have been applied, they often suffer from convergence issues, and their computational accuracy is compromised under certain conditions. This study proposes a novel method for computing the forced response backbone curves of structures with frictional contact interfaces. The method accurately tracks the backbone curve through a parameter continuation scheme, formulated via Lagrange multipliers and accelerated by incorporating a derived analytical Hessian Tensor of contact elements. This approach yields highly accurate numerical results and enables numerical singularities on the curve to be identified and robustly traversed. The proposed method is validated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam finite-element model and a lumped-parameter blade-damper-blade model. The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional dNNMs and phase resonance methods, particularly in cases involving either high structural damping or strong frictional damping. This work provides a robust computational tool and presents a detailed comparative analysis that clarifies the applicability and limitations of the proposed and conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Superlensing with Complex Frequencies Illuminations: Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that the resolution of superlensing slabs can be significantly enhanced with complex frequency illuminations. In this study, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing electromagnetic superlensing. The framework offers new and transparent insights. It helps clarify what resolution can be expected with complex frequency, or more generally, pulse illuminations, but it also highlights inherent limitations and tempers high expectations raised by recent electromagnetic experiments in the infrared.</description>

      <title>Geometric integrators for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>
