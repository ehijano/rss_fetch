      <title>Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth's surface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface temperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by a conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6) and 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since 2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar (non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both surface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by the positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated results by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose destruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven reaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of rapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic amplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that started at the end of 2023.</description>

      <title>Contributions of greenhouse gases and solar activity to global climate change from CMIP6 models simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative estimates of the contributions of the anthropogenic forcing, characterized by changes in the radiative forcing of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2, in particular), and solar activity variations to the trends of the global surface temperature on secular temporal horizons are obtained with the aid of autoregressive models from simulations with climate models of the CMIP6 ensemble and from long-term observational data since the 19th century. The results for the simulations with climate models characterized by low, medium and high temperature sensitivity to changes in the CO2 content are compared. It is found, in particular, that the estimates from observation data revealing the determinative contribution of the CO2 content to the global surface temperature trends on half-century and century-long time intervals are most consistent with the estimates from simulations with the climate model with the lowest sensitivity of the global surface temperature to doubling the CO2 atmospheric content.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Turbulence Producing Motions in the ABL Across a Natural Roughness Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landforms such as sand dunes act as roughness elements to Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows, triggering the development of new scales of turbulent motions. These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick-up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes -- with knock on consequences for dust emission. While feedbacks between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment-transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy large-eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. More, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events -- turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co-evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectra of 2D inertial gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>

      <title>OceanCastNet: A Deep Learning Ocean Wave Model with Energy Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional wave forecasting models, although based on energy conservation equations, are computationally expensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning geophysical fluid models, while computationally efficient, often suffer from issues such as energy dissipation in long-term forecasts. This paper proposes a novel energy-balanced deep learning wave forecasting model called OceanCastNet (OCN). By incorporating wind fields at the current, previous, and future time steps, as well as wave fields at the current and previous time steps as input variables, OCN maintains energy balance within the model. Furthermore, the model employs adaptive Fourier operators as its core components and designs a masked loss function to better handle the impact of land-sea boundaries. A series of experiments on the ERA5 dataset demonstrate that OCN can achieve short-term forecast accuracy comparable to traditional models while exhibiting an understanding of the wave generation process. In comparative experiments under both normal and extreme conditions, OCN consistently outperforms the widely used WaveWatch III model in the industry. Even after long-term forecasting, OCN maintains a stable and energy-rich state. By further constructing a simple meteorological model, OCN-wind, which considers energy balance, this paper confirms the importance of energy constraints for improving the long-term forecast performance of deep learning meteorological models. This finding provides new ideas for future research on deep learning geophysical fluid models.</description>

      <title>A case study of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques for weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of real-world processes are spatiotemporal, and the data generated by them exhibits both spatial and temporal evolution. Weather is one of the most essential processes in this domain, and weather forecasting has become a crucial part of our daily routine. Weather data analysis is considered the most complex and challenging task. Although numerical weather prediction models are currently state-of-the-art, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Numerous studies have proposed time series-based models as a viable alternative to numerical forecasts. Recent research in the area of time series analysis indicates significant advancements, particularly regarding the use of state-space-based models (white box) and, more recently, the integration of machine learning and deep neural network-based models (black box). The most famous examples of such models are RNNs and transformers. These models have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of time-series analysis and have demonstrated effectiveness in modelling temporal correlations. It is crucial to capture both temporal and spatial correlations for a spatiotemporal process, as the values at nearby locations and time affect the values of a spatiotemporal process at a specific point. This self-contained paper explores various regional data-driven weather forecasting methods, i.e., forecasting over multiple latitude-longitude points (matrix-shaped spatial grid) to capture spatiotemporal correlations. The results showed that spatiotemporal prediction models reduced computational costs while improving accuracy. In particular, the proposed tensor train dynamic mode decomposition-based forecasting model has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art models without the need for training. We provide convincing numerical experiments to show that the proposed approach is practical.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from offline high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere and enables simulating indefinitely at reduced costs. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>
