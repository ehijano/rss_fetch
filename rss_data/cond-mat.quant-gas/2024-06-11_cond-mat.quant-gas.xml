      <title>Multifractality and hyperuniformity in quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models with and without disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of boson density and bosonic condensate. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a divergence of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Josephson dynamics and localization revivals in ultradilute quantum liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Josephson junction of an ultradilute quantum liquid is studied in a double-well potential. We analyze the dynamics as a function of the interaction strength and compare the results to the standard bosonic Josephson junction. It is found that the beyond-mean-field effects alter the dynamics, particularly in the regime, where the beyond-mean-field corrections dominate over the residual mean-field interaction. In that case, we observe non-linear dynamics describing localization revivals instead of regular Josephson oscillations. In the regime where the ultradilute quantum liquids perform the regular Josephson oscillations, their frequency is also significantly changed in comparison with the regular Josephson junction. These results provide experimental characteristics of the ultradilute quantum liquids that contrast with the Josephson oscillations of a regular Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing period-doubled density waves by spin-orbit coupling in Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, mean-field energy can support the existence of period-doubled density waves, which are similar to Bloch waves but have the double periodicity of the underlying lattice potentials. However, they are dynamically unstable. Here, we propose to use the spin-orbit coupling to stabilize the period-doubled density waves. The stabilization mechanism is revealed to relate to interaction-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking of the spin-flip parity symmetry.</description>

      <title>Surface criticality in the mixed-field Ising model with sign-inverted next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array have been used as a quantum simulator of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields. We suggest how to implement the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction whose sign is opposite to that of the nearest neighbor one in the Rydberg atom systems. We show that this can be achieved by weakly coupling one Rydberg state with another Rydberg state. We further study the surface criticality associated with the first-order quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which emerges due to the sign-inverted NNN interaction. From the microscopic model, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation, which describes static and dynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the transition. Using both analytical GL theory and numerical method based on a mean-field theory, we calculate the order parameter in the proximity of a boundary of the system in order to show that the healing length of the order parameter logarithmically diverges, signaling the surface criticality.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensates of microwave-shielded polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the ultracold gases of bosonic microwave-shielded polar molecules. To account for the large shielding core of the inter-molecular potential, we adopt a variational ansatz incorporating the Jastrow correlation factor. We show that the system is always stable and supports a self-bound gas phase and an expanding gas phase. We also calculate the condensate fraction which is significantly reduced when the size of the shielding core of the two-body potential becomes comparable to the inter-molecular distance. Our studies distinguish the molecular condensates from the atomic ones and invalidate the application of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to the microwave-shielded molecular gases. Our work paves the way for studying the Bose-Einstein condensations of ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Survival probability, particle imbalance, and their relationship in quadratic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Quantum Tunneling via Matter Wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling refers to a phenomenon that a microscopic object can pass through a potential barrier even it does not have enough energy to overcome the barrier. It has led to many modern applications and nanotechnologies. A general belief is that quantum tunneling, as a manifestation of the wave-particle duality, occurs only when the width of the barrier is comparable to or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, via studying the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice, we discover a mechanism to realize a long-range quantum tunneling. It is found that, by the mediation role of the propagating matter wave emitted from the excited-state atom, a coherent tunneling of the tightly confined atom to the remote trapping potentials can occur as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the total system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Breaking through the generally believed distance constraint of quantum tunneling, our result opens another avenue to realize quantum tunneling and gives a guideline to develop tunneling devices.</description>

      <title>Learning effective Hamiltonians for adaptive time-evolution quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation of many-body dynamics relies on Trotterization to decompose the target time evolution into elementary quantum gates operating at a fixed equidistant time discretization. Recent advances have outlined protocols enabling more efficient adaptive Trotter protocols, which have been shown to exhibit a controlled error in the dynamics of local observables and correlation functions. However, it has remained open to which extent the errors on the actual generator of the dynamics, i.e., the target many-body Hamiltonian, remain controlled. Here, we propose to use quantum Hamiltonian learning to numerically obtain the effective Hamiltonian and apply it on the recently introduced ADA-Trotter algorithm as a concrete demonstration. Our key observation is that deviations from the target generator remain bounded on all simulation times. This result suggests that the ADA-Trotter not only generates reliable digital quantum simulation of local dynamics, but also controllably approximates the global quantum state of the target system. Our proposal is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other adaptive time-evolution algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics. Here we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz [D. Pfau et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033429 (2020).] for variational Monte Carlo calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitatively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification based on the idea of an antisymmetric geminal power singlet (AGPs) wave function. The new AGPs FermiNet outperforms the original FermiNet significantly in paired systems, giving results which are more accurate than fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and are consistent with experiment. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz, which only differs from the original Ansatz by the method of antisymmetrization, is a strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantages with the original FermiNet: the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and the flexibility of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluids.</description>

      <title>Phonon damping in a 2D superfluid: insufficiency of Fermi's golden rule at low temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that the phonon gas of a superfluid always enters a weak coupling regime at sufficiently low temperatures, whatever the strength of the interactions between the underlying particles (constitutive of the superfluid). Thus, in this limit, we should always be able to calculate the damping rate of thermal phonons by applying Fermi's golden rule to the Hamiltonian  $H_3$ of cubic phonon-phonon coupling taken from quantum hydrodynamics, at least in the case of a convex acoustic branch and in the collisionless regime (where the eigenfrequency of the considered phonons remains much greater than the gas thermalization rate). Using the many-body Green's function method, we predict that, unexpectedly, this is not true in two dimensions, contrary to the three-dimensional case. We confirm this prediction with classical phonon-field simulations and a non-perturbative theory in $H_3$, where the fourth order is regularized by hand, giving a complex energy to the virtual phonons of the four-phonon collisional processes. For a weakly interacting fluid and a phonon mode in the long-wavelength limit, we predict a damping rate about three times lower than that of the golden rule.</description>

Abstract: In classical fluids, the Weber number is a dimensionless parameter that characterises the flow of a multi-phase fluid. The superfluid analogy of a classical multi-phase fluid can be realised in a system of two or more immiscible Bose-Einstein condensates. These superfluid mixtures have been shown to display a wider variety of exotic dynamics than their single component counterparts. Here we systematically study the dynamics of a binary immiscible Bose-Einstein Condensate in two dimensions, where a small bubble of the second component is used to "stir" the first component. We begin by rigorously mapping out the critical velocity for vortex shedding as a function of the size of the bubble, in analogy to the critical velocity of a laser spoon. Observing that the dynamics of the system depend on the initial size and velocity of the bubble, we then show that a dimensionless parameter with the same form as the Weber number accurately predicts the resulting bubble fragmentation.</description>

Abstract: The concept of information scrambling elucidates the dispersion of local information in quantum many-body systems, offering insights into various physical phenomena such as wormhole teleportation. This phenomenon has spurred extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. Among these, the size-winding mechanism emerges as a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing signal detection. In this work, we establish a computational framework for determining the winding size distribution in large-$N$ quantum systems with all-to-all interactions, utilizing the scramblon effective theory. We obtain the winding size distribution for the large-$q$ SYK model across the entire time domain. Notably, we unveil that the manifestation of size winding results from a universal phase factor in the scramblon propagator, highlighting the significance of the Lyapunov exponent. These findings contribute to a sharp and precise connection between operator dynamics and the phenomenon of wormhole teleportation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

Abstract: Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model. We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing perspectives of ergodicity and localization.</description>

Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>
