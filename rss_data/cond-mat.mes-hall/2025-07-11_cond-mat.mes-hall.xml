      <title>Majorana edge reconstruction and the $\nu=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Correlated quantum shift vector of particle-hole excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.</description>

      <title>Generic and intrinsic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance at weak fields in non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) is a decrease in the electrical resistivity of a material when the driving electric field and an external magnetic field are collinear. In the semiclassical weak field regime, the NLMR of non-magnetic metals is activated in the presence of substantial concentrations of Berry curvature (BC). This restricts the appearance of a semi-classical NLMR to metals with acentric crystalline arrangements, including Weyl semimetals. Here, we show a previously unidentified mechanism of semi-classical NLMR that can be present in strongly spin-orbit coupled non-magnetic metals even if the crystal possess bulk inversion symmetry. A Zeeman-activated BC directly couples to the orbital motion of Bloch electrons to generate a negative MR that scales with the relaxation time precisely as the Drude resistivity. Importantly, the Zeeman-activated BC is \emph{independent} of the external magnetic field strength. It is instead related to the degree of non-parabolicity of the spin-orbit coupled electronic bands. We show that this NLMR mechanism, which is independent of the Land\'e $g$-factor, is generic and appears in \emph{all} centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in topological and conventional conductors.</description>

      <title>Biexciton-polariton coupling mediated by dark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement. Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Transport Calculations: An Effective Medium Theory with Plane-Wave Basis and PAW Potentials in Eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</description>

      <title>Mass-transport-limited reaction rates and molecular diffusion in the van der Waals gap beneath graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement of molecules within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a two-dimensional 2D material and a catalytic substrate offers a promising route toward the development of molecule-selective catalysts with increased reaction rates. However, identifying the kinetic limitations of such confined reactions remains challenging. Here, we employ an inverted wedding-cake configuration of multilayer graphene on platinum to study the dynamics of graphene etching in the vdW gap by various molecules (O2, H2, and CO), using in situ scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions explored (up to p = 1.4x10-3 Pa and T = 1000 {\deg}C), the etching reaction rates are limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persists even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further reveal multiple etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space. Once mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor, facilitating reaction pathways that would be otherwise inaccessible on a pristine surface without spatial confinement.</description>

      <title>Graphene Heterostructure-Based Non-Volatile Memory Devices with Top Floating Gate Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphene-based memory platform built on dual-gated field-effect transistors (GFETs). By integrating a lithographically defined metal patch directly atop the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-graphene channel, the device functions simultaneously as a top gate, floating gate (FG) reservoir, and active reset contact. This architecture forms an ultrathin van der Waals heterostructure with strong capacitive coupling to the back-gate, confirmed by a dynamic model, enabling a tunable and wide memory window that scales with back-gate voltage and is further enhanced by reducing hBN thickness or increasing FG area. Our devices demonstrate reversible, high-efficiency charge programming, robust non-volatile behavior across 10 to 300 K and a wide range of operation speeds, and endurance beyond 9800 cycles. Importantly, a grounded top electrode provides on-demand charge erasure, offering functionality that is absent in standard FG designs. These results position hBN/graphene-based GFETs as a compact, energy-efficient platform for next-generation 2D flash memory, with implications for multilevel memory schemes and cryogenic electronics.</description>

      <title>Edge State Selective Measurement of Quantum Hall Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge states reflect the key physical properties yet are difficult to probe individually, particularly when several states are present at an edge. We present momentum resolved tunneling spectroscopy between a quantum well and a quantum wire to extract the dispersions of the quantum Hall edge states. Momentum and energy selective tunneling allows to separately address the different states even if they are spatially overlapping. This delivers the edge state velocities over broad ranges of magnetic field and density, in excellent agreement with a hard-wall model. This technique provides a basis for future edge state selective spectroscopy on quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in a van der Waals plasmonic self-cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$. Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free, geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: the space-frequency domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of isotropic chiral matter, as described by Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, arises in distinct physical contexts ranging from condensed matter systems to Lorentz-violating extensions of high-energy physics. Here, we derive exact expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields that contribute independently to Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter. Each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, yielding radiation that emerges at a characteristic angle, akin to the standard case. Furthermore, we identify specific frequency ranges that permit zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones for a given setup. Remarkably, one sector of the model allows for the existence of threshold-free Cherenkov radiation arising from slowly-moving charges.</description>

      <title>Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large unconventional anomalous Hall effect far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncoplanar spin textures usually exhibit a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC) that can generate effective magnetic fields and lead to additional contributions to the Hall effect, namely topological or unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE). Unlike topological spin textures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions), materials that exhibit fluctuation-driven SSC and UAHE are rare. So far, their realization has been limited to either low temperatures or high magnetic fields, both of which are unfavorable for practical applications. Identifying new materials that exhibit UAHE in a low magnetic field at room temperature is therefore essential. Here, we report the discovery of a large UAHE far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films, where the fluctuation-driven SSC stems from the field-induced transverse-conical-spiral phase. Considering their epitaxial nature and the large UAHE stabilized at room temperature in a low magnetic field, Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films represent an exciting, albeit rare, case of a promising candidate material for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Common topological origin of longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance in Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal the coexistence and correlation of a topological cusp anomaly in the planar Hall signal and a spin-flip scattering dominated positive longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) across the entire temperature range below the Curie point in Fe3GeTe2. This correlation dies out exponentially as the magnetic field is directed away from the ab-plane, resulting in unusually sharp polar angle dependence of longitudinal MR and the Hall response.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap in a crystalline insulator doped by disordered metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Electronic rotons and Wigner crystallites in a two-dimensional dipole liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid forms the aperiodic dispersion of rotons that played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquid (magneto-rotons) and the supersolidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid in the absence of a magnetic field, their repulsive interactions were predicted to form a roton minimum that can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals and superconductivity, but it has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions doping charges to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal a striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons characterized by a local minimum of energy at a finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases, where interactions dominate over kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0 as in crystals, signalling Wigner crystallisation. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of Fermi liquids. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Dark states of electrons in a quantum system with two pairs of sublattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Superlubricity of Borophene: Tribological Properties in Comparison to hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications. Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice structures with a strongly corrugated moir\'e reconstruction. Our experimental study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction. Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the properties of these 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Reversible local strain engineering of $\mathrm{WS}_2$ using a micro-mechanical spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) introduce well-known lattice artifacts. We present a novel Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Condition (SBC) that is perfectly isotropic. Through detailed comparative simulations, we demonstrate that SBC eliminates the structural and dynamic anisotropy inherent to PBC. For the crowded systems where these artifacts are most prominent, our method is also computationally more efficient than standard Minimum Image Convention implementations. This establishes SBC as a powerful, high-fidelity alternative for simulating isotropic matter.</description>

Abstract: Topological magnon bands enable uni-directional edge transport without backscattering, enhancing the robustness of magnonic circuits and providing a novel platform for exploring quantum transport phenomena. Magnetic skyrmion lattices, in particular, host a manifold of topological magnon bands with multipole character and non-reciprocal dispersions. These modes have been explored already in the short and long wavelength limit, but previously employed techniques were unable to access intermediate wavelengths comparable to inter-skyrmion distances. Here, we report the detection of such magnons with wavevectors $|{\bf q}|\simeq 48$ rad $\mu$m$^{-1}$ in the metastable skyrmion lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad bandwidth various multipole excitation modes could be resolved over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known counterclockwise, breathing and clockwise modes with dipole character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to theoretical predictions enabled the additional identification of a quadrupole mode and, possibly, a sextupole mode. Our work highlights the potential of skyrmionic phases for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon states at GHz frequencies.</description>

Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect is widely understood as a phenomoenon in which spin current flows perpendicular to an electric field. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, however, spin current is ambiguous, and the SH conductivity depends on the definition of spin current. In this article, we develop an \textit{ab initio} computational scheme for the spin accumulation coefficient, which characterizes the spin accumulation and would be an alternative indicator of the SH effect. The proposed method has been implemented into an open-source software Wannier90 and serves high-precision \textit{ab initio} research on the SH effect.</description>

Abstract: We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce short range electron-electron interactions which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase. Without interactions, or in the presence of long range correlations, the lattice is unstable towards formation of either anisotropic Dirac cones, or simple (quadratic) semi-Dirac phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Enriching condensed-matter systems with quantum optical phenomena currently drives intense research efforts, particularly to introduce collective quantum correlations. Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range tunneling, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range tunneling is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and extended phase coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our sudy unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case $(n=1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of linearity in the spectrum for arbitrary $n$ over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_{f}$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>
