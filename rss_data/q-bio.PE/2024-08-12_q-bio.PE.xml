      <title>The 2023 Dengue Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A One-Health Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction. Here we reported the virological, entomological and epidemiological characteristics of the large autochthonous outbreak of dengue (DENV) occurred in a small village of the Lombardy region (Northern Italy) during summer 2023.
  Methods. After the diagnosis of the first autochthonous case on 18 August 2023, public health measures, including epidemiological investigation and vector control measures, were carried out. A serological screening for DENV antibodies detection was offered to the population. In the case of positive DENV IgM, a second sample was collected to detect DENV RNA and verify seroconversion. Entomological and epidemiological investigations were also performed. A modeling analysis was conducted to estimate the dengue generation time, transmission potential, distance of transmission, and assess diagnostic delays.
  Results. Overall, 416 subjects participated to the screening program and 20 were identified as DENV-1 cases (15 confirmed and 5 probable). In addition, DENV-1 infection was diagnosed in 24 symptomatic subjects referred to the local Emergency Room Department for suggestive symptoms and 1 case was identified through blood donation screening. The average generation time was estimated to be 18.3 days (95% CI: 13.1-23.5 days). R0 was estimated at 1.31 (95% CI: 0.76-1.98); 90% of transmission occurred within 500m. Entomological investigations performed in 46 pools of mosquitoes revealed the presence of only one positive pool for DENV-1.
  Discussion. This report highlights the importance of synergic surveillance, including virological, entomological and public health measures to control the spread of arboviral infections.</description>

      <title>Coexistence via trophic cascade in plant-herbivore-carnivore systems under intense predation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carnivores interact with herbivores to indirectly impact plant populations, creating trophic cascades within plant-herbivore-carnivore systems. We developed and analyzed a food chain model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the critical roles carnivores play in ecosystems where plants face intense herbivory. Our model incorporates key factors such as seed production rates, seed germination probabilities, local plant interactions, herbivory rates, and carnivore predation rates. In the absence of carnivores, herbivores significantly reduce plant densities, often driving plants to extinction under high herbivory rates. However, the presence of carnivores suppresses herbivore populations, allowing plants to recover from herbivore pressure. We found that plant densities increase with carnivore predation rates, highlighting top-down effects and underscoring the importance of conserving carnivores in ecosystems where plants are at high risk of extinction from herbivory. Our results also show that carnivore density increases with seed-production rates, while herbivore density remains constant, indicating that plants benefit carnivores more than herbivores. This increase in carnivore density driven by high seed-production rates reflects bottom-up effects in the system. Overall, our study demonstrates that plants, herbivores, and carnivores can coexist even under intense predation stress. It suggests that carnivores play a crucial role in regulating plant and herbivore populations, with significant potential for maintaining biodiversity within ecosystems.</description>
