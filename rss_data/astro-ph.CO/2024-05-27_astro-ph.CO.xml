      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Lensing Constraints on PBHs: Substellar to Intermediate Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a robust tool to detect and directly measure the abundance and mass of any kind of compact objects, either in our galaxy or in the extragalatic domain. On basis to generic, broadly applicable arguments, it is concluded that the observed microlensing magnifications are too small and the microlensing events less frequent than the expectations for a significant population of compact objects (other than normal stars). The detection of chromatic effects of microlensing, neither supports the presence of BHs. Detailed statistical studies of the observed microlensing magnifications and events frequency impose strict upper limits to the fraction of total mass of BHs ($\ltsim$ 1\%) from $10^{-7}M_\odot$ to indefinitely large masses. These results hold even when the BHs are distributed according to a mass spectrum or are forming clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The squeezed cross-bispectrum \bispeconed\ between the gravitational lensing in the Cosmic Microwave Background and the 1D \lya\ forest power spectrum can constrain bias parameters and break degeneracies between $\sigma_8$ and other cosmological parameters. We detect \bispeconed\ with $4.8\sigma$ significance at an effective redshift $z_\mathrm{eff}=2.4$ using Planck PR3 lensing map and over 280,000 quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's first-year data. We test our measurement against metal contamination and foregrounds such as Galactic extinction and clusters of galaxies by deprojecting the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We compare our results to a tree-level perturbation theory calculation and find reasonable agreement between the model and measurement.</description>

      <title>Exploring interacting bulk viscous model with decaying vacuum density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study a cosmological model composed of a viscous dark matter interacting with decaying vacuum energy in a spatially flat Universe. In the first part, we find the analytical solution of different cosmological parameters by assuming the physically viable forms of bulk viscosity and decaying vacuum density with the interaction term. The second part is dedicated to constrain the free parameters of the interacting viscous model with decaying vacuum energy by employing latest observational data of $Pantheon+$, Cosmic Chronometer and $f(z)\sigma_{8}(z)$. We find that the interacting model just deviate very slightly from well-known concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and can alleviate effectively the current $H_0$ tension between local measurement by R21 and global measurement by Planck 2018, and the excess in the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_{8}$ essentially vanish in this context. We report the Hubble constants as $H_0=72.150^{+0.989}_{-0.779}$, and $ 72.202^{+0.796}_{-0.937}$ \;$km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, deceleration parameters as $q_0=-0.533 \pm 0.024$, and $-0.531 \pm 0.024$, and equation of state parameters as $w_0=-0.689 \pm 0.016$, and $ -0.687 \pm 0.016$ for $\Lambda$CDM and interacting models, respectively. It is found that the interacting model is in good agreement with $\Lambda$CDM. Further, we discuss the amplitude of matter power spectrum $\sigma_8$ and its associated parameter $S_8$ using $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ data. Finally, the information selection criterion and Bayesian inference are discussed to distinguish the interacting model with $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>$\pi$ phase ambiguity of cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the rotation angle $\beta$ of cosmic birefringence, which is a recently reported parity-violating signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has a phase ambiguity of $n\pi \,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$. This ambiguity has a significant impact on the interpretation of the origin of cosmic birefringence. Assuming an axion-like particle as the origin of cosmic birefringence, this ambiguity can be partly broken by the anisotropic cosmic birefringence and the shape of the CMB angular power spectra. We also discuss constraints on $\beta$ from existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Interaction in the dark sector: a phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-gravitational interaction between the dark components of the Universe could lead to the variation of dark matter energy density standard evolution law. When we assume this scenario, the dark matter energy density follows $\rho_{{dm}}\sim(1+z)^{3 + \epsilon(z)}$ (where $\epsilon(z)=0$ the standard law is recovered). In this paper, we perform a Bayesian analysis to test three parameterizations for $\epsilon(z)$, namely: $\epsilon(z)=\epsilon_0$, $\epsilon(z)=\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1\frac{z}{1+z}$ and $\epsilon(z)=\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1\frac{z(1+z)}{1+z^2}$, where the first one is motivated through the fundamental grounds and the others are on the phenomenological ones. Through the Gaussian process regression, our method uses galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements, SNe Ia observations, Cosmic Chronometers, and BAO data. No specific cosmological model is considered. In all possibilities analyzed, the standard evolution law ($\epsilon(z)=0$) is within $2\sigma$ c.l. The investigated cases generally indicated scenarios of inconclusive or weak evidence toward the simplest model from the Bayesian standpoint.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Re-Mapping the close-by galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the local repulsion force caused by the expansion of the Universe. This research extends the definition of zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions for different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations for Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups viralization. With these definitions, we indicate the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. The results show that it is important to include the cosmological constant in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, optimal transport theory and their link to the Galileons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematicians have been proposing for sometimes that Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear generalization of the Poisson equation, where trace of the Hessian is replaced by its determinant, provides an alternative non-relativistic description of gravity. Monge-Amp\`ere equation is affine invariant, has rich geometric properties, connects to optimal transport theory, and remains bounded at short distances. Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, that uses a slightly different form of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, naturally emerges through the application of large-deviation principle to a Brownian system of indistinguishable and independent particles. In this work we provide a physical formulation of this mathematical model, study its theoretical viability and confront it with observations. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity cannot replace the Newtonian gravity as it does not withstand the solar-system test. We then show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity can describe a scalar field, often evoked in modified theories of gravity such as Galileons. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, as a nonlinear model of a new scalar field, is screened at short distances, and behaves differently from Newtonian gravity above galactic scales but approaches it asymptotically. Finally, we write a relativistic Lagrangian for Monge-Amp\`ere gravity in flat space time, which is the field equation of a sum of the Lagrangians of all Galileons. We also show how the Monge-Amp\`ere equation can be obtained from the fully covariant Lagrangian of quartic Galileon in the static limit. The connection between optimal transport theory and modified theories of gravity with second-order field equations, unravelled here, remains a promising domain to further explore.</description>

      <title>AGEL: Is the Conflict Real? Investigating Galaxy Evolution Models using Strong Lensing at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations currently limited to $z \lesssim 0.5$. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts between $0.3 &lt; z_{\rm defl} &lt; 0.9$. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope $\gamma$, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm obs}$) for four lenses and obtain $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of $-1.95 \pm 0.09$ and a $\gamma$--$z$ relation that does not evolve with redshift at $z&lt;1$. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at $z&lt;1$ that suggest the $\gamma$--$z$ relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of 1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; 2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and 3) assuming a simple power-law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at $z_{\rm defl} &gt; 0.5$, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A Strong Blend in the Morning: Studying the Circumgalactic Medium Before Cosmic Noon with Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study of the properties of a new class of circumgalactic medium absorbers identified in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: "Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$" (or SBLA) absorption systems. We study SBLAs at $2.4&lt;z&lt;3.1$ in SDSS-IV/eBOSS spectra by their strong extended Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption complexes covering 138 $\,\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ with an integrated $\log (N_{HI}/$cm$^{-2}) =16.04\substack{+0.05 \\ -0.06}$ and Doppler parameter $b=18.1 \substack{+0.7 \\ -0.4}\,\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. Clustering with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides a large-scale structure bias of $b = 2.34\pm0.06$ and halo mass estimate of $M_h \approx 10^{12}{\rm h^{-1}M_{sol}}$ for our SBLA sample. We measure the ensemble mean column densities of 22 metal features in the SBLA composite spectrum and find that no single-population multiphase model for them is viable. We therefore explore the underlying SBLA population by forward modelling the SBLA absorption distribution. Based on covariance measurements and favoured populations we find that $\approx 25$\% of our SBLAs have stronger metals. Using silicon only we find that our strong metal SBLAs trace gas with a $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) &gt; -2.40$ for $T=10^{3.5}$K and show gas clumping on $&lt;210$ parsec scales. We fit multiphase models to this strong sub-population and find a low ionization phase with $n_H=1$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=0.8$, an intermediate ionization phase with $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) = -3.05$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=-0.8$, and a poorly constrained higher ionization phase. We find that the low ionization phase favours cold, dense super-solar metallicity gas with a clumping scale of just 0.009 parsecs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we constrain the Hubble constant parameter, $H_0$, using a combination of the Pantheon sample and galaxy clusters (GC) measurements from minimal cosmological assumptions. Assuming the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation, an estimator is created for $H_0$ that only depends on simple geometrical distances, which is evaluated from Pantheon and a GC angular diameter distance sample afterward. The statistical and systematic errors in GC measurements are summed in quadrature in our analysis. We find $H_0 = 67.22 \pm 6.07$ ${\rm km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ in $1\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). This measurement presents an error of around 9\%, showing that future and better GC measurements can shed light on the current Hubble tension</description>

      <title>Light Fields during Inflation from BOSS and Future Galaxy Surveys</title>

Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields present during inflation offers a compelling observational target for galaxy surveys. These fields are of significant theoretical interest since they offer a window into particle physics in the inflaton sector. They also violate the single-field consistency conditions and induce a scale-dependent bias in the galaxy power spectrum. In this paper, we explore this particular signal for light scalar fields and study the prospects for measuring it with galaxy surveys. We find that the sensitivities of current and future surveys are remarkably stable for different configurations, including between spectroscopic and photometric redshift measurements. This is even the case at non-zero masses where the signal is not obviously localized on large scales. For realistic galaxy number densities, we demonstrate that the redshift range and galaxy bias of the sample have the largest impact on the sensitivity in the power spectrum. These results additionally motivated us to explore the potentially enhanced sensitivity of Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST through multi-tracer analyses. Finally, we apply this understanding to current data from the last data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and place new constraints on light fields coupled to the inflaton.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the stochastic QCD axion window: departure from equilibrium during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If dark matter is made of QCD axions, its abundance is determined by the vacuum expectation value acquired by the axion field during inflation. The axion is usually assumed to follow the equilibrium distribution arising from quantum diffusion during inflation. This leads to the so-called stochastic window under which the QCD axion can make up all the dark matter. It is characterised by $10^{10.4}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{17.2}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}&gt;10^{-2.2}\mathrm{GeV}$, where $f$ is the axion decay constant and $H_{\mathrm{end}}$ is the Hubble expansion rate at the end of inflation. However, in realistic inflationary potentials, we show that the axion never reaches the equilibrium distribution at the end of inflation. This is because the relaxation time of the axion is much larger than the typical time scale over which $H$ varies during inflation. As a consequence, the axion acquires a quasi-flat distribution as long as it remains light during inflation. This leads us to reassessing the stochastic axion window, and we find that $ 10^{10.3}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{14.1}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}&gt;10^{-13.8}\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on extended Proca-Nuevo gravity and cosmology</title>

Abstract: We confront massive Proca-Nuevo gravity with cosmological observations. The former is a non-linear theory involving a massive spin-1 field, that can be extended incorporating operators of the Generalized Proca class, and when coupled to gravity it can be covariantized in a way that exhibits consistent and ghost-free cosmological solutions, without experiencing instabilities and superluminalities at the perturbative level. When applied at a cosmological framework it induces extra terms in the Friedmann equations, however due to the special non-linear construction the field is eliminated in favor of the Hubble function. Thus, the resulting effective dark energy sector is dynamical, however it contains the same number of free parameters with the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model. We use data from Supernovae Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) observations and we construct the corresponding likelihood-contours for the free parameters. Interestingly enough, application of various information criteria, such as AIC, BIC and DIC, shows that the scenario of massive Proca-Nuevo gravity, although having exactly the same number of free parameters with $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is more efficient in fitting the data. Finally, the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter shows statistical compatibility with the model-independent, data-driven reconstructed one.</description>

Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Lagrangian Perturbation Theory for the Large Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model-independent approach to lagrangian perturbation theory for the large scale structure of the universe. We focus on the displacement field for dark matter particles, and derive its most general structure without assuming a specific form for the equations of motion, but implementing a set of general requirements based on symmetry principles and consistency with the perturbative approach. We present explicit results up to sixth order, and provide an algorithmic procedure for arbitrarily higher orders. The resulting displacement field is expressed as an expansion in operators built up from the linear density field, with time-dependent coefficients that can be obtained, in a specific model, by solving ordinary differential equations. The derived structure is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, including modified gravity scenarios of the Hordenski type and models with multiple dark matter species. This work is a first step towards a complete model-independent lagrangian forward model, to be employed in cosmological analyses with power spectrum and bispectrum, other summary statistics, and field-level inference.</description>

      <title>The host dark matter haloes of the first quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $z &gt; 6$ quasars reside in rare, massive haloes, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts they should be surrounded by an anomalously high number of bright companion galaxies. Here I show that these companion galaxies should also move unusually fast. Using a new suite of cosmological, `zoom-in' hydrodynamic simulations, I present predictions for the velocity distribution of quasar companion galaxies and its variation with quasar host halo mass at $z \, = \, 6$. Satellites accelerate as they approach the quasar host galaxy, producing a line-of-sight velocity profile that broadens with decreasing distance to the quasar host galaxy. This increase in velocity dispersion is particularly pronounced if the host halo mass is $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$. Typical line-of-sight speeds rise to $\approx 500 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ at projected radii $\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$. For about $10\%$ of satellites, they should exceed $800 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$, with $\approx 5\%$ of companions reaching line-of-sight speeds $\sim 1000 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$. For lower host halo masses $\approx 5 \times 10^{11} - 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$, the velocity profile of companion galaxies is significantly flatter. In this case, typical line-of-sight velocities are $\approx 250 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ and do not exceed $\approx 500 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$. A comparison with existing ALMA, JWST and MUSE line-of-sight velocity measurements reveals that observed $z &gt; 6$ quasar companions closely follow the velocity distribution expected for a host halo with mass $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$, ruling out a light host halo. Finally, through an estimate of UV and \oiii \, luminosity functions, I show that the velocity distribution more reliably discriminates between halo mass than companion number counts, which are strongly affected by cosmic variance.</description>

Abstract: The observation of the global 21 cm signal produced by neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and Epoch of Reionization requires measurements with extremely well-calibrated wideband radiometers. We describe the design and characterization of the Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST), which is a new ground-based, single-antenna, global 21 cm experiment. The design of MIST was guided by the objectives of avoiding systematics from an antenna ground plane and cables around the antenna, as well as maximizing the instrument's on-sky efficiency and portability for operations at remote sites. We have built two MIST instruments, which observe in the range 25-105 MHz. For the 21 cm signal, this frequency range approximately corresponds to redshifts 55.5 &gt; z &gt; 12.5, encompassing the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. The MIST antenna is a horizontal blade dipole of 2.42 m in length, 60 cm in width, and 52 cm in height above the ground. This antenna operates without a metal ground plane. The instruments run on 12 V batteries and have a maximum power consumption of 17 W. The batteries and electronics are contained in a single receiver box located under the antenna. We present the characterization of the instruments using electromagnetic simulations and lab measurements. We also show sample sky measurements from recent observations at remote sites in California, Nevada, and the Canadian High Arctic. These measurements indicate that the instruments perform as expected. Detailed analyses of the sky measurements are left for future work.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Detection of the Global 21 cm Signal with MIST for Different Models of the Soil and Beam Directivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) is a new ground-based, single-antenna, radio experiment attempting to detect the global 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. A significant challenge in this measurement is the frequency-dependence, or chromaticity, of the antenna beam directivity. MIST observes with the antenna above the soil and without a metal ground plane, and the beam directivity is sensitive to the electrical characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we use simulated observations with MIST to study how the detection of the global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn is affected by the soil and the MIST beam directivity. We simulate observations using electromagnetic models of the directivity computed for single- and two-layer models of the soil. We test the recovery of the Cosmic Dawn signal with and without beam chromaticity correction applied to the simulated data. We find that our single-layer soil models enable a straightforward recovery of the signal even without chromaticity correction. Two-layer models increase the beam chromaticity and make the recovery more challenging. However, for the model in which the bottom soil layer has a lower electrical conductivity than the top layer, the signal can be recovered even without chromaticity correction. For the other two-layer models, chromaticity correction is necessary for the recovery of the signal and the accuracy requirements for the soil parameters vary between models. These results will be used as a guideline to select observation sites that are favorable for the detection of the Cosmic Dawn signal.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh frequency primordial gravitational waves beyond the kHz: The case of cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) of primordial origin that would manifest only at ultra-high frequencies, from kilohertz to 100 gigahertz, and leave no signal at either LIGO, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, LISA, or pulsar-timing arrays. We focus on GWBs produced by cosmic strings and make predictions for the GW spectra scanning over high-energy scale (beyond $10^{10}$ GeV) particle physics parameters. Signals from local string networks can easily be as large as the Big Bang nucleosynthesis/cosmic microwave background bounds, with a characteristic strain as high as $10^{-26}$ in the 10 kHz band, offering prospects to probe grand unification physics in the $10^{14}-10^{17}$ GeV energy range. In comparison, GWB from axionic strings is suppressed (with maximal characteristic strain $\sim 10^{-31}$) due to the early matter era induced by the associated heavy axions. We estimate the needed reach of hypothetical futuristic GW detectors to probe such GWB and, therefore, the corresponding high-energy physics processes. Beyond the information of the symmetry-breaking scale, the high-frequency spectrum encodes the microscopic structure of the strings through the position of the UV cutoffs associated with cusps and kinks, as well as potential information about friction forces on the string. The IR slope, on the other hand, reflects the physics responsible for the decay of the string network. We discuss possible strategies for reconstructing the scalar potential, particularly the scalar self-coupling, from the measurement of the UV cutoff of the GW spectrum.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

      <title>Impact of local CP-odd domain in hot QCD on axionic domain-wall interpretation for NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the axionic domain-wall with a QCD bias may be incompatible with the NANOGrav 15-year data on a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, when the domain wall network collapses in the hot-QCD induced local CP-odd domain. This is due to the drastic suppression of the QCD bias set by the QCD topological susceptibility in the presence of the CP-odd domain with nonzero $\theta$ parameter of order one which the QCD sphaleron could generate. We quantify the effect on the GW signals by working on a low-energy effective model of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type in the mean field approximation. We find that only at $\theta=\pi$, the QCD bias tends to get significantly large enough due to the criticality of the thermal CP restoration, which would, however, give too big signal strengths to be consistent with the NANOGrav 15-year data and would also be subject to the strength of the phase transition at the criticality.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>
