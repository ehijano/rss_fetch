      <title>Fabrication and Experimental Study of Prototype NdFeB Helical Undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experiment with short prototypes of helical undulators, comprised of longitudinally magnetized helices made from a single piece of a rare-earth magnet, is described. Wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) in combination with a flat tool and the rotary movement of the workpiece made it possible to achieve high precision in the manufacture of NdFeB helices. An assembly of two oppositely longitudinally magnetized helices with a period of 20 mm and a relatively large inner diameter of 8 mm creates a field of 0.53 T on the axis of the system, which ensures the value of the undulator parameter K close to unity. According to the calculation, Halbach-type helical micro-undulators with periods of (3-6) mm of four helices can provide a field of 1 T and K = 0.28-0.6 at the axis.</description>

      <title>Tunable, phase-locked hard X-ray pulse sequences generated by a free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to arbitrarily dial in amplitudes and phases enables the fundamental quantum state operations pioneered for microwaves and then infrared and visible wavelengths during the second half of the last century. Self-seeded X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) routinely generate coherent, high-brightness, and ultrafast pulses for a wide range of experiments, but have so far not achieved a comparable level of amplitude and phase control. Here we report the first tunable phase-locked, ultra-fast hard X-ray (PHLUX) pulses by implementing a recently proposed method: A fresh-bunch self-seeded FEL, driven by an electron beam that was shaped with a slotted foil and a corrugated wakefield structure, generates coherent radiation that is intensity-modulated on the femtosecond time scale. We measure phase-locked (to within a shot-to-shot phase jitter corresponding to 0.1 attoseconds) pulse triplets with a photon energy of 9.7 keV, a pulse energy of several tens of microjoules, a freely tunable relative phase, and a pulse delay tunability between 4.5 and 11.9 fs. Such pulse sequences are suitable for a wide range of applications, including coherent spectroscopy, and have amplitudes sufficient to enable hard X-ray quantum optics experiments. More generally, these results represent an important step towards a hard X-ray arbitrary waveform generator.</description>

      <title>An Online Data Analysis Framework for Accelerator-Based Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on diagnostic data is of crucial importance to physics experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June 2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with minimal modification.</description>

      <title>Transverse beam instabilities in low-emittance booster synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the ring-based light source community is moving towards fourth-generation light sources, many facilities plan to upgrade their boosters in parallel to meet the more demanding beam properties for the storage ring, especially in terms of a much lower emittance. Concerns over collective effects have, therefore, risen, particularly in the transverse planes, since the vacuum chamber dimensions tend to be reduced as a way to achieve a stronger focusing force on the beam. In this article, we present numerical studies on transverse beam instabilities, both in the single- and multibunch regimes, in the SOLEIL II booster as an example of a low-emittance booster. We show that Landau damping is an efficient mechanism for suppressing both transverse single-bunch and coupled-bunch instabilities. We also prove that the damping in the longitudinal plane can diffuse to the transverse plane and limit the transverse emittance growth. Moreover, we have discovered that the beam can exhibit sawtooth instability at high energy and that broad-band impedance is one of the key factors in suppressing transverse coupled-bunch instability.</description>
