      <title>Power Spectrum Signatures of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point signatures based on the Laplacian operators on graphs, point clouds, and manifolds have become popular tools in machine learning for graphs, clustering, and shape analysis. In this work, we propose a novel point signature, the power spectrum signature, a measure on $\mathbb{R}$ defined as the squared graph Fourier transform of a graph signal. Unlike eigenvectors of the Laplacian from which it is derived, the power spectrum signature is invariant under graph automorphisms. We show that the power spectrum signature is stable under perturbations of the input graph with respect to the Wasserstein metric. We focus on the signature applied to classes of indicator functions, and its applications to generating descriptive features for vertices of graphs. To demonstrate the practical value of our signature, we showcase several applications in characterizing geometry and symmetries in point cloud data, and graph regression problems.</description>

      <title>Explainable Bayesian deep learning through input-skip Latent Binary Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling natural phenomena with artificial neural networks (ANNs) often provides highly accurate predictions. However, ANNs often suffer from over-parameterization, complicating interpretation and raising uncertainty issues. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address the latter by representing weights as probability distributions, allowing for predictive uncertainty evaluation. Latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNNs) further handle structural uncertainty and sparsify models by removing redundant weights. This article advances LBBNNs by enabling covariates to skip to any succeeding layer or be excluded, simplifying networks and clarifying input impacts on predictions. Ultimately, a linear model or even a constant can be found to be optimal for a specific problem at hand. Furthermore, the input-skip LBBNN approach reduces network density significantly compared to standard LBBNNs, achieving over 99% reduction for small networks and over 99.9% for larger ones, while still maintaining high predictive accuracy and uncertainty measurement. For example, on MNIST, we reached 97% accuracy and great calibration with just 935 weights, reaching state-of-the-art for compression of neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed method accurately identifies the true covariates and adjusts for system non-linearity. The main contribution is the introduction of active paths, enhancing directly designed global and local explanations within the LBBNN framework, that have theoretical guarantees and do not require post hoc external tools for explanations.</description>

      <title>Sample and Map from a Single Convex Potential: Generation using Conjugate Moment Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to generative modeling is to split model-fitting into two blocks: define first how to sample noise (e.g. Gaussian) and choose next what to do with it (e.g. using a single map or flows). We explore in this work an alternative route that ties sampling and mapping. We find inspiration in moment measures, a result that states that for any measure $\rho$ supported on a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a unique convex potential $u$ such that $\rho=\nabla u\,\sharp\,e^{-u}$. While this does seem to tie effectively sampling (from log-concave distribution $e^{-u}$) and action (pushing particles through $\nabla u$), we observe on simple examples (e.g., Gaussians or 1D distributions) that this choice is ill-suited for practical tasks. We study an alternative factorization, where $\rho$ is factorized as $\nabla w^*\,\sharp\,e^{-w}$, where $w^*$ is the convex conjugate of $w$. We call this approach conjugate moment measures, and show far more intuitive results on these examples. Because $\nabla w^*$ is the Monge map between the log-concave distribution $e^{-w}$ and $\rho$, we rely on optimal transport solvers to propose an algorithm to recover $w$ from samples of $\rho$, and parameterize $w$ as an input-convex neural network.</description>

      <title>Technical Insights and Legal Considerations for Advancing Federated Learning in Bioinformatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Bags of Projected Nearest Neighbours: Competitors to Random Forests?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple and intuitive adaptive k nearest neighbours classifier, and explore its utility within the context of bootstrap aggregating ("bagging"). The approach is based on finding discriminant subspaces which are computationally efficient to compute, and are motivated by enhancing the discrimination of classes through nearest neighbour classifiers. This adaptiveness promotes diversity of the individual classifiers fit across different bootstrap samples, and so further leverages the variance reducing effect of bagging. Extensive experimental results are presented documenting the strong performance of the proposed approach in comparison with Random Forest classifiers, as well as other nearest neighbours based ensembles from the literature, plus other relevant benchmarks. Code to implement the proposed approach is available in the form of an R package from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/BOPNN.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Bayesian inverse problems with diffusion priors and off-policy RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical application of Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB), a recently introduced off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) objective that can asymptotically solve Bayesian inverse problems optimally. We extend the original work by using RTB to train conditional diffusion model posteriors from pretrained unconditional priors for challenging linear and non-linear inverse problems in vision, and science. We use the objective alongside techniques such as off-policy backtracking exploration to improve training. Importantly, our results show that existing training-free diffusion posterior methods struggle to perform effective posterior inference in latent space due to inherent biases.</description>

      <title>Cover Learning for Large-Scale Topology Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</description>

      <title>Designing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Discrete Choice with Network Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model architecture that incorporates network effects into discrete choice problems, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while offering greater interpretability than general-purpose flexible model classes. Econometric discrete choice models aid in studying individual decision-making, where agents select the option with the highest reward from a discrete set of alternatives. Intuitively, the utility an individual derives from a particular choice depends on their personal preferences and characteristics, the attributes of the alternative, and the value their peers assign to that alternative or their previous choices. However, most applications ignore peer influence, and models that do consider peer or network effects often lack the flexibility and predictive performance of recently developed approaches to discrete choice, such as deep learning. We propose a novel graph convolutional neural network architecture to model network effects in discrete choices, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while retaining the interpretability necessary for inference--a quality often lacking in general-purpose deep learning architectures. We evaluate our architecture using revealed commuting choice data, extended with travel times and trip costs for each travel mode for work-related trips in New York City, as well as 2016 U.S. election data aggregated by county, to test its performance on datasets with highly imbalanced classes. Given the interpretability of our models, we can estimate relevant economic metrics, such as the value of travel time savings in New York City. Finally, we compare the predictive performance and behavioral insights from our architecture to those derived from traditional discrete choice and general-purpose deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Batch List-Decodable Linear Regression via Higher Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of list-decodable linear regression using batches. A batch is called clean if it consists of i.i.d. samples from an unknown linear regression distribution. For a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1/2)$, an unknown $\alpha$-fraction of the batches are clean and no assumptions are made on the remaining ones. The goal is to output a small list of vectors at least one of which is close to the true regressor vector in $\ell_2$-norm. [DJKS23] gave an efficient algorithm, under natural distributional assumptions, with the following guarantee. Assuming that the batch size $n$ satisfies $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(\alpha^{-1})$ and the number of batches is $m = \mathrm{poly}(d, n, 1/\alpha)$, their algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs a list of $O(1/\alpha^2)$ vectors at least one of which is $\tilde{O}(\alpha^{-1/2}/\sqrt{n})$ close to the target regressor. Here we design a new polynomial time algorithm with significantly stronger guarantees under the assumption that the low-degree moments of the covariates distribution are Sum-of-Squares (SoS) certifiably bounded. Specifically, for any constant $\delta&gt;0$, as long as the batch size is $n \geq \Omega_{\delta}(\alpha^{-\delta})$ and the degree-$\Theta(1/\delta)$ moments of the covariates are SoS certifiably bounded, our algorithm uses $m = \mathrm{poly}((dn)^{1/\delta}, 1/\alpha)$ batches, runs in polynomial-time, and outputs an $O(1/\alpha)$-sized list of vectors one of which is $O(\alpha^{-\delta/2}/\sqrt{n})$ close to the target. That is, our algorithm achieves substantially smaller minimum batch size and final error, while achieving the optimal list size. Our approach uses higher-order moment information by carefully combining the SoS paradigm interleaved with an iterative method and a novel list pruning procedure. In the process, we give an SoS proof of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality that may be of broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Temporal Difference Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive models of the future are fundamental for an agent's ability to reason and plan. A common strategy learns a world model and unrolls it step-by-step at inference, where small errors can rapidly compound. Geometric Horizon Models (GHMs) offer a compelling alternative by directly making predictions of future states, avoiding cumulative inference errors. While GHMs can be conveniently learned by a generative analog to temporal difference (TD) learning, existing methods are negatively affected by bootstrapping predictions at train time and struggle to generate high-quality predictions at long horizons. This paper introduces Temporal Difference Flows (TD-Flow), which leverages the structure of a novel Bellman equation on probability paths alongside flow-matching techniques to learn accurate GHMs at over 5x the horizon length of prior methods. Theoretically, we establish a new convergence result and primarily attribute TD-Flow's efficacy to reduced gradient variance during training. We further show that similar arguments can be extended to diffusion-based methods. Empirically, we validate TD-Flow across a diverse set of domains on both generative metrics and downstream tasks including policy evaluation. Moreover, integrating TD-Flow with recent behavior foundation models for planning over pre-trained policies demonstrates substantial performance gains, underscoring its promise for long-horizon decision-making.</description>

      <title>An Asymmetric Independence Model for Causal Discovery on Path Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory linking 'E-separation' in directed mixed graphs (DMGs) with conditional independence relations among coordinate processes in stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where causal relationships are determined by "which variables enter the governing equation of which other variables". We prove a global Markov property for cyclic SDEs, which naturally extends to partially observed cyclic SDEs, because our asymmetric independence model is closed under marginalization. We then characterize the class of graphs that encode the same set of independence relations, yielding a result analogous to the seminal 'same skeleton and v-structures' result for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In the fully observed case, we show that each such equivalence class of graphs has a greatest element as a parsimonious representation and develop algorithms to identify this greatest element from data. We conjecture that a greatest element also exists under partial observations, which we verify computationally for graphs with up to four nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel semigroup contraction analysis based on Lyapunov techniques to prove the exponential convergence of Sinkhorn equations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields exponential decays of Sinkhorn iterates towards Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to general classes of $\phi$-divergences as well as in weighted Banach spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this type in the literature on entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm. We also illustrate the impact of these results in the context of multivariate linear Gaussian models as well as statistical finite mixture models including Gaussian-kernel density estimation of complex data distributions arising in generative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of probabilistic prediction methodologies in route planning within a road network context. Specifically, we introduce the Conformalized Quantile Regression for Graph Autoencoders (CQR-GAE), which leverages the conformal prediction technique to offer a coverage guarantee, thus improving the reliability and robustness of our predictions. By incorporating uncertainty sets derived from CQR-GAE, we substantially improve the decision-making process in route planning under a robust optimization framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying the CQR-GAE model to a real-world traffic scenario. The results indicate that our model significantly outperforms baseline methods, offering a promising avenue for advancing intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in infinite-dimensional diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness and scalability in function generation tasks where the underlying structure is inherently infinite-dimensional. To accelerate inference in such models, we derive, for the first time, an analog of the probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Leveraging this newly formulated PF-ODE, we reduce the number of function evaluations while maintaining sample quality in function generation tasks, including applications to PDEs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Error Analysis of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models based on transformer architectures have become integral to state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. However, their training remains computationally expensive and exhibits instabilities, some of which are expected to be caused by finite-precision computations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of round-off errors within the forward pass of a transformer architecture which yields fundamental bounds for these effects. In addition, we conduct a series of numerical experiments which demonstrate the practical relevance of our bounds. Our results yield concrete guidelines for choosing hyperparameters that mitigate round-off errors, leading to more robust and stable inference.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Circular Regression with von Mises Quasi-Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The probability model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Gibbs sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters and apply our sampling scheme to the Double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles.</description>

      <title>Score matching for bridges without learning time-reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning bridged diffusion processes using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, yields a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, we learn the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$ directly, for given $t, y$, completely avoiding first learning a time-reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term. The code can be found at https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge.</description>

      <title>The Breakdown of Gaussian Universality in Classification of High-dimensional Linear Factor Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption of Gaussian or Gaussian mixture data has been extensively exploited in a long series of precise performance analyses of machine learning (ML) methods, on large datasets having comparably numerous samples and features. To relax this restrictive assumption, subsequent efforts have been devoted to establish "Gaussian equivalent principles" by studying scenarios of Gaussian universality where the asymptotic performance of ML methods on non-Gaussian data remains unchanged when replaced with Gaussian data having the same mean and covariance. Beyond the realm of Gaussian universality, there are few exact results on how the data distribution affects the learning performance.
  In this article, we provide a precise high-dimensional characterization of empirical risk minimization, for classification under a general mixture data setting of linear factor models that extends Gaussian mixtures. The Gaussian universality is shown to break down under this setting, in the sense that the asymptotic learning performance depends on the data distribution beyond the class means and covariances. To clarify the limitations of Gaussian universality in the classification of mixture data and to understand the impact of its breakdown, we specify conditions for Gaussian universality and discuss their implications for the choice of loss function.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Experimental Design via Contrastive Diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a powerful tool to reduce the cost of running a sequence of experiments. When based on the Expected Information Gain (EIG), design optimization corresponds to the maximization of some intractable expected contrast between prior and posterior distributions. Scaling this maximization to high dimensional and complex settings has been an issue due to BOED inherent computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a pooled posterior distribution with cost-effective sampling properties and provide a tractable access to the EIG contrast maximization via a new EIG gradient expression. Diffusion-based samplers are used to compute the dynamics of the pooled posterior and ideas from bi-level optimization are leveraged to derive an efficient joint sampling-optimization loop. The resulting efficiency gain allows to extend BOED to the well-tested generative capabilities of diffusion models. By incorporating generative models into the BOED framework, we expand its scope and its use in scenarios that were previously impractical. Numerical experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods show the potential of the approach.</description>

      <title>Credal Two-Sample Tests of Epistemic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce credal two-sample testing, a new hypothesis testing framework for comparing credal sets -- convex sets of probability measures where each element captures aleatoric uncertainty and the set itself represents epistemic uncertainty that arises from the modeller's partial ignorance. Compared to classical two-sample tests, which focus on comparing precise distributions, the proposed framework provides a broader and more versatile set of hypotheses. This approach enables the direct integration of epistemic uncertainty, effectively addressing the challenges arising from partial ignorance in hypothesis testing. By generalising two-sample test to compare credal sets, our framework enables reasoning for equality, inclusion, intersection, and mutual exclusivity, each offering unique insights into the modeller's epistemic beliefs. As the first work on nonparametric hypothesis testing for comparing credal sets, we focus on finitely generated credal sets derived from i.i.d. samples from multiple distributions -- referred to as credal samples. We formalise these tests as two-sample tests with nuisance parameters and introduce the first permutation-based solution for this class of problems, significantly improving existing methods. Our approach properly incorporates the modeller's epistemic uncertainty into hypothesis testing, leading to more robust and credible conclusions, with kernel-based implementations for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for amortized neural posterior estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

      <title>A Geometric Framework for Understanding Memorization in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As deep generative models have progressed, recent work has shown them to be capable of memorizing and reproducing training datapoints when deployed. These findings call into question the usability of generative models, especially in light of the legal and privacy risks brought about by memorization. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the manifold memorization hypothesis (MMH), a geometric framework which leverages the manifold hypothesis into a clear language in which to reason about memorization. We propose to analyze memorization in terms of the relationship between the dimensionalities of (i) the ground truth data manifold and (ii) the manifold learned by the model. This framework provides a formal standard for "how memorized" a datapoint is and systematically categorizes memorized data into two types: memorization driven by overfitting and memorization driven by the underlying data distribution. By analyzing prior work in the context of the MMH, we explain and unify assorted observations in the literature. We empirically validate the MMH using synthetic data and image datasets up to the scale of Stable Diffusion, developing new tools for detecting and preventing generation of memorized samples in the process.</description>

      <title>An Optimistic Algorithm for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with adversarial constraints, where an online algorithm must make sequential decisions to minimize both convex loss functions and cumulative constraint violations. We focus on a setting where the algorithm has access to predictions of the loss and constraint functions. Our results show that we can improve the current best bounds of $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ regret and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative constraint violations to $ O(\sqrt{E_T(f)}) $ and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{E_T(g^+)}) $, respectively, where $ E_T(f) $ and $E_T(g^+)$ represent the cumulative prediction errors of the loss and constraint functions. In the worst case, where $E_T(f) = O(T) $ and $ E_T(g^+) = O(T) $ (assuming bounded gradients of the loss and constraint functions), our rates match the prior $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ results. However, when the loss and constraint predictions are accurate, our approach yields significantly smaller regret and cumulative constraint violations. Finally, we apply this to the setting of adversarial contextual bandits with sequential risk constraints, obtaining optimistic bounds $O (\sqrt{E_T(f)} T^{1/3})$ regret and $O(\sqrt{E_T(g^+)} T^{1/3})$ constraints violation, yielding better performance than existing results when prediction quality is sufficiently high.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large-scale models in recent years has increased the importance of statistical models with numerous parameters. Several studies have analyzed over-parameterized linear models with high-dimensional data, which may not be sparse; however, existing results rely on the assumption of sample independence. In this study, we analyze a linear regression model with dependent time-series data in an over-parameterized setting. We consider an estimator using interpolation and develop a theory for the excess risk of the estimator. Then, we derive non-asymptotic risk bounds for the estimator for cases with dependent data. This analysis reveals that the coherence of the temporal covariance plays a key role; the risk bound is influenced by the product of temporal covariance matrices at different time steps. Moreover, we show the convergence rate of the risk bound and demonstrate that it is also influenced by the coherence of the temporal covariance. Finally, we provide several examples of specific dependent processes applicable to our setting.</description>

      <title>Tackling water table depth modeling via machine learning: From proxy observations to verifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial patterns of water table depth (WTD) play a crucial role in shaping ecological resilience, hydrological connectivity, and human-centric systems. Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) continuous map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation across the study region and within ten major ecoregions of North America, we demonstrate that our models (corr=0.6-0.75) can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD compared to two available PB simulations of WTD (corr=0.21-0.40). However, we still argue that currently-available large-scale simulations of static WTD could be uncertain within data-scarce regions such as steep mountainous regions. We reason that biased observational data mainly collected from low-elevation floodplains and the over-flexibility of available models can negatively affect the verifiability of large-scale simulations of WTD. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to improve machine learning-based WTD estimations. In particular, we advocate for the use of proxy satellite data, the incorporation of physical laws, the implementation of better model verification standards, the development of novel globally-available emergent indices, and the collection of more reliable observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequential multi-task problem, where each task is modeled as the stochastic multi-armed bandit with K arms. We assume the bandit tasks are adjacently similar in the sense that the difference between the mean rewards of the arms for any two consecutive tasks is bounded by a parameter. We propose two algorithms (one assumes the parameter is known while the other does not) based on UCB to transfer reward samples from preceding tasks to improve the overall regret across all tasks. Our analysis shows that transferring samples reduces the regret as compared to the case of no transfer. We provide empirical results for our algorithms, which show performance improvement over the standard UCB algorithm without transfer and a naive transfer algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Clifford Algebraic Approach to E(n)-Equivariant High-order Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</description>

      <title>Swing-by Dynamics in Concept Learning and Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spectrum of weighted sample covariance: another proof of spectrum convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose another proof of the high dimensional spectrum convergence of the weighted sample covariance, more concise and self-sufficient but with stronger, but reasonable assumptions. We explain and illustrates this theorem for different weight distributions and show how the spectrum behaves in finite samples with heavy tails. The general purpose is to provide a detailed introduction to the high dimensional spectrum of weighted sample covariance.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.</description>

      <title>Connections between sequential Bayesian inference and evolutionary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <title>Analysis of High-dimensional Gaussian Labeled-unlabeled Mixture Model via Message-passing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19553</link>

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data in conjunction with a limited amount of labeled data. Although SSL has been applied in various applications and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated, it is still not fully understood when and why SSL performs well. Some existing theoretical studies have attempted to address this issue by modeling classification problems using the so-called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These studies provide notable and insightful interpretations. However, their analyses are focused on specific purposes, and a thorough investigation of the properties of GMM in the context of SSL has been lacking. In this paper, we conduct such a detailed analysis of the properties of the high-dimensional GMM for binary classification in the SSL setting. To this end, we employ the approximate message passing and state evolution methods, which are widely used in high-dimensional settings and originate from statistical mechanics. We deal with two estimation approaches: the Bayesian one and the $\ell_2$-regularized maximum likelihood estimation (RMLE). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two approaches, examining aspects such as the global phase diagram, estimation error for the parameters, and prediction error for the labels. A specific comparison is made between the Bayes-optimal (BO) estimator and RMLE, as the BO setting provides optimal estimation performance and is ideal as a benchmark. Our analysis shows that with appropriate regularizations, RMLE can achieve near-optimal performance in terms of both the estimation error and prediction error, especially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data. These results demonstrate that the $\ell_2$ regularization term plays an effective role in estimation and prediction in SSL approaches.</description>

      <title>Assessing high-order effects in feature importance via predictability decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the large body of work devoted in recent years to describe redundancy and synergy in multivariate interactions among random variables, we propose a novel approach to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance, one of the most used techniques for explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, we propose an adaptive version of a well-known metric of feature importance, named Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO), to disentangle high-order effects involving a given input feature in regression problems. LOCO is the reduction of the prediction error when the feature under consideration is added to the set of all the features used for regression. Instead of calculating the LOCO using all the features at hand, as in its standard version, our method searches for the multiplet of features that maximize LOCO and for the one that minimize it. This provides a decomposition of the LOCO as the sum of a two-body component and higher-order components (redundant and synergistic), also highlighting the features that contribute to building these high-order effects alongside the driving feature. We report the application to proton/pion discrimination from simulated detector measures by GEANT.</description>

      <title>FEDS: Feature and Entropy-Based Distillation Strategy for Efficient Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) methods have recently outperformed traditional codecs such as VVC in rate-distortion performance. However, their large models and high computational costs have limited their practical adoption. In this paper, we first construct a high-capacity teacher model by integrating Swin-Transformer V2-based attention modules, additional residual blocks, and expanded latent channels, thus achieving enhanced compression performance. Building on this foundation, we propose a \underline{F}eature and \underline{E}ntropy-based \underline{D}istillation \underline{S}trategy (\textbf{FEDS}) that transfers key knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight student model. Specifically, we align intermediate feature representations and emphasize the most informative latent channels through an entropy-based loss. A staged training scheme refines this transfer in three phases: feature alignment, channel-level distillation, and final fine-tuning. Our student model nearly matches the teacher across Kodak (1.24\% BD-Rate increase), Tecnick (1.17\%), and CLIC (0.55\%) while cutting parameters by about 63\% and accelerating encoding/decoding by around 73\%. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that FEDS generalizes effectively to transformer-based networks. The experimental results demonstrate our approach strikes a compelling balance among compression performance, speed, and model parameters, making it well-suited for real-time or resource-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Generative Samplers for Investigating Critical Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating critical phenomena or phase transitions is of high interest in physics and chemistry, for which Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a crucial tool for numerically analyzing macroscopic properties of given systems, are often hindered by an emerging divergence of correlation length -- known as scale invariance at criticality (SIC) in the renormalization group theory. SIC causes the system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing sampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields for generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed Generative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for near-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a nuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat Bath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to high-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional HB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers from a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation always occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and higher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not considered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a part of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those residual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show that the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for 128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.</description>
