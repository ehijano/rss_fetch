      <title>On Hardy spaces associated with the twisted Laplacian and sharp estimates for the corresponding wave operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove various equivalent characterisations of the Hardy space $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ associated with the twisted Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ which generalises the result of [MPR81] for the case $p=1$. Using the atomic characterisation of $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ corresponding to the twisted convolution, we prove sharp boundedness result for the wave operator $\mathcal{L}^{-\delta/2}e^{\pm it\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}}$ for a fixed $t&gt;0$ on $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. More precisely we prove that it is a bounded operator from $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ to $L^p(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $ 0&lt;p\leq 1$ and $\delta\geq (2n-1)\left(1/p-1/2\right)$.</description>

      <title>Smoothness in the space of bounded linear operators on semi-Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nonzero positive operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$, a semi-inner product is naturally induced on $\mathbb{H}$. In this work, we introduce the notion of \emph{$A$-smoothness} for bounded linear operators on the resulting semi-Hilbert space and investigate its various properties. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the $A$-smoothness for $A$-bounded operators and further analyze the $A$-smoothness of $A$-compact operators in terms of their $A$-norm attainment sets. Utilizing these characterizations, we establish that G\^{a}teaux differentiability of the semi-norm $\|\cdot\|_A$ at an $A$-bounded operator is equivalent to its $A$-smoothness. Furthermore, we characterize the $A$-smoothness of $2\times 2$ block diagonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces and Bossard's reduction argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of E. Basset, G. Lancien and A. Proch\'azka, we use the reduction argument of Bossard to prove two results: if a separable Banach space is isomorphically universal for the class of Lipschitz-free spaces over the countable complete discrete metric spaces then it is isomorphically universal for the class of separable Banach spaces, and if a complete separable metric space is Lipschitz universal for the same class of metric spaces then it is Lipschitz universal for all separable metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A surprising threshold for the validity of the method of singular projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact manifold $ \mathcal{N} $ embedded into $ \mathbb{R}^{\nu} $ and a projection $ P $ that retracts $ \mathbb{R}^{\nu} $ except a singular set of codimension $ \ell $ onto $ \mathcal{N} $, we investigate the maximal range of parameters $ s $ and $ p $ such that the projection $ P $ can be used to turn an $ \mathbb{R}^{\nu} $-valued $ W^{s,p} $ map into an $ \mathcal{N} $-valued $ W^{s,p} $ map.
  Devised by Hardt and Lin with roots in the work of Federer and Fleming, the method of projection is known to apply in $ W^{1,p} $ if and only if $ p &lt; \ell $, and has been extended in some special cases to more general values of the regularity parameter $ s $.
  As a first result, we prove in full generality that, when $ s \geq 1 $, the method of projection can be applied in the whole expected range $ sp &lt; \ell $.
  When $ 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 $, the method of projection was only known to be applicable when $ p &lt; \ell $, a more stringent condition than $ sp &lt; \ell $.
  As a second result, we show that, somehow surprisingly, the condition $ p &lt; \ell $ is optimal, by constructing, for every $ 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 $ and $ p \geq \ell $, a bounded $ W^{s,p} $ map into $ \mathbb{R}^{\ell} $ whose singular projections onto the sphere $ \mathbb{S}^{\ell-1} $ all fail to belong to $ W^{s,p} $.
  As a byproduct of our method, a similar conclusion is obtained for the closely related method of almost retraction, devised by Haj\l asz, for which we also prove a more stringent threshold of applicability when $ 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 $.</description>

      <title>On similarity to contraction semigroups and tensor products, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01005v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of finite tensor products of Hilbert spaces, we prove that similarity of a tensor product of operator semigroups to a contraction semigroup is equivalent to the corresponding similarity for each factor, after an appropriate rescaling. A similar result holds with contractivity replaced by quasi-contractivity. This splitting phenomenon allows us to construct new and, in a sense, the strongest possible examples of $C_0$-semigroups not similar to contractions, thus completing an important chapter of the theory. We also address the discrete setting and relate it to our results.</description>

      <title>Similarity to contraction semigroups: structural properties, criteria, and applications to control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal new aspects of the structure of Hilbert space $C_0$-semigroups $\mathcal T = (T(t))_{t\ge 0}$ similar to semigroups of contractions. In particular, we prove that $\mathcal T$ is similar to a semigroup of contractions if and only if $\mathcal T$ is similar to a quasi-contraction $C_0$-semigroup and $T(t)$ is similar to a contraction for a single $t&gt;0.$ Moreover, our methods allow us to estimate the corresponding similarity constants and clarify their role in the study of similarity to contractions. Along the way, we obtain similarity conditions involving unbounded operators and imposing minimal assumptions on regularity of $\mathcal T$. Such a general setting allows us to find significant applications to control theory, including characterizations of exactly observable and exactly controllable systems. Finally we establish several criteria of the same flavor for similarity to isometric semigroups, and illustrate the developed theory by a number of pertinent examples.</description>

      <title>Robustness to noise and erasures of Gabor frames in finite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the robustness of structured frames to measurement noise and erasures, with the focus on Gabor frames $(g, \Lambda)$ with arbitrary sets of time-frequency shifts $\Lambda$. This property of frames is important in many signal processing applications, from wireless communication to phase retrieval and quantization. We aim to analyze the dependence of the frame bounds of such frames on their structure and cardinality and provide constructions of nearly tight Gabor frames with small $\vert \Lambda \vert$. We show that the frame bounds of Gabor frames with a random window $g$ and frame set $\Lambda$ show similar behavior to the frame bounds of random frames with independent entries. Moreover, we study uniform estimates for the frame bounds in the case of measurement erasures. We prove numerical robustness to erasures for mutually unbiased bases frames with erasure rate up to 50\% and show that the Gabor frame generated by the Alltop window can provide results similar to the best previously known deterministic constructions.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff-Kellogg type results in product spaces and their application to differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the well-known Birkhoff-Kellogg invariant-direction Theorem in product spaces. Our results concern operator systems and give the existence of component-wise eigenvalues, instead of scalar eigenvalues as in the classical case, that have corresponding eigenvectors with all components nontrivial and localized by their norm. We also show that, when applied to nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential equations, this localization property of the eigenvectors provides, in turn, qualitative properties of the solutions. This is illustrated in two context of systems of PDEs and ODEs. We illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results with two explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Operators on de Branges Spaces and Paley-Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of de Branges spaces containing polynomials, sufficient and necessary conditions are given for the boundedness and compactness of the Hausdorff operators under consideration. For the Paly-Wiener spaces we reduce the study of our Hausdorff operators to classical integral ones. The operators that appeared are Carleman and therefore closeble in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We obtain also conditions for boundedness, compactness and nuclearity of our operators in the Paley-Wiener space as well as the conditions for their belonging to the Hilbert-Schmidt class.</description>

      <title>Totally convex functions, $L^2$-Optimal transport for laws of random measures, and solution to the Monge problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Optimal Transport problem for laws of random measures in the Kantorovich-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$, associated with a Hilbert space $\mathrm{H}$ (with finite or infinite dimension) and for the corresponding quadratic cost induced by the squared Wasserstein metric in $\\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}).$
  Despite the lack of smoothness of the cost, the fact that the space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ is not Hilbertian, and the curvature distortion induced by the underlying Wasserstein metric, we will show how to recover at the level of random measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ the same deep and powerful results linking Euclidean Optimal Transport problems in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ and convex analysis.
  Our approach relies on the notion of totally convex functionals, on their total subdifferentials, and their Lagrangian liftings in the space square integrable $\mathrm{H}$-valued maps $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$
  With these tools, we identify a natural class of regular measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ for which the Monge formulation of the OT problem has a unique solution and we will show that this class includes relevant examples of measures with full support in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ arising from the push-forward transformation of nondegenerate Gaussian measures in $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$</description>

      <title>Approximation of rearrangements by polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric decreasing rearrangement of functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ features in several seminal inequalities, such as the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. The latter was shown by the authors to hold for all smoothing rearrangements, a class that includes the more general $(k,n)$-Steiner rearrangement, as well as others introduced by Brock and by Solynin. The theory of rearrangements and their associated set maps is developed, with an emphasis on approximation, particularly by polarizations. The P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds with equality for polarizations, so is proved relatively easily for rearrangements that can be suitably approximated by them. One goal here is to show that the Brock rearrangements cannot be approximated in such a way. It turns out that under mild conditions, each set map associated with a rearrangement has in turn an associated contraction map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. With this new analytical tool, several general results on the approximation of rearrangements are also proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connections existing between max-infinitely divisible distributions and Poisson processes from the point of view of functional analysis. More precisely, we derive functional identities for the former by using well-known results of Poisson stochastic analysis. We also introduce a family of Markov semigroups whose stationary measures are the so-called multivariate max-stable distributions. Their generators thus provide a functional characterization of extreme valued distributions in any dimension. Additionally, we give a few functional identities associated to those semi-groups, namely a Poincar{\'e} identity and commutation relations. Finally, we present a stochastic process whose semigroup corresponds to the one we introduced and that can be expressed using extremal stochastic integrals.</description>

      <title>Compactness of compositions of strictly singular operators on direct sums of Baernstein, Schreier and $\ell_p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the direct sum of finitely many Banach spaces chosen from the following three families: (i) the Baernstein spaces $B_p$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$; (ii) the $p$-convexified Schreier spaces $S_p$ for $1\le p&lt;\infty$; (iii) the sequence spaces $\ell_p$ for $1\le p&lt;\infty$ (and $c_0$). We show that the quotient algebra of strictly singular by compact operators on $X$ is nilpotent; that is, there is a natural number $k$, dependent only on the collections of direct summands from each of the three families, such that:
  - every composition of $k+1$ strictly singular operators on $X$ is compact;
  - there are $k$ strictly singular operators on $X$ whose composition is not compact.</description>

      <title>Power series statistical convergence and an abstract Korovkin-type approximation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an abstract Korovkin-type approximation theorem in general spaces, extending the framework of approximation theory to accommodate broader contexts. A critical result supporting this theorem is the proof that any $P$-statistically convergent sequence contains a classically convergent subsequence over a density $1$ set, which plays a foundational role in the analysis. As a conclusion, we investigate the convergence of the $r$-th order generalization of linear operators, which may lack positivity, and present a Korovkin-type approximation theorem for periodic functions, both utilizing $P$-statistical convergence. These contributions generalize and improve existing results in approximation theory, providing novel insights and methodologies, supported by practical examples and corollaries.</description>

      <title>Continuous Donoho-Elad Spark Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donoho and Elad \textit{[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003]} introduced the important notion of the spark of a frame, using which they derived a fundamental uncertainty principle. Based on spark, they also provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of sparse solutions to the NP-hard $\ell_0$-minimization problem. In this nano note, we show that the notion of spark can be extended to linear maps whose domains are measure spaces. Using this generalization, we derive an uncertainty principle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of sparse solutions to linear systems on measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Doubly Commuting Semigroups of Isometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00409v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the structure of doubly commuting semigroups of isometries. We record a new proof of Cooper's theorem in the Hilbert module setting. We discuss the Fell topology on the set of equivalence classes of irreducible, doubly commuting isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$. We show that if $d$ is finite, the topology is $T_0$. We indicate the pathologies that occur when $d=\infty$. In particular, we show that Wold decomposition fails for isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\infty}$ and prove that the Fell topology on the set of equivalence classes of irreducible, doubly commuting isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\infty}$ is not $T_0$</description>

      <title>Caccioppoli-type inequalities for the Dunkl-$A$-Laplacian and their application to nonexistence result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a suitable function $A:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$, we introduce the $A$-Laplacian in the Dunkl framework as $\Delta_{k,A}(u) =\text{div}_k(A(\nabla_ku))$, where $\nabla_k$ is the Dunkl-gradient operator associated with the multiplicity function $k$ and the root system $\mathcal{R}$. We derive the local and global Caccioppoli-type inequality for an element $u$ in the Dunkl-Orlicz-Sobolev space, satisfying the Dunkl-differential inequality $$ -\Delta_{k, A}(u) \geq b\Phi(u)\chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}. $$ Using the Caccioppoli inequality, we establish a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of a nonzero solution $u$ to the Dunkl-differential inequality.</description>

Abstract: We introduce random-kernel networks, a multilayer extension of random feature models where depth is created by deterministic kernel composition and randomness enters only in the outermost layer. We prove that deeper constructions can approximate certain functions with fewer Monte Carlo samples than any shallow counterpart, establishing a depth separation theorem in sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Infinity thick quasiconvexity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate geometric properties of a metric measure space where every function in the Newton--Sobolev space $N^{1,\infty}(Z)$ has a Lipschitz representative. We prove that when the metric space is locally complete and the reference measure is infinitesimally doubling, the above property is equivalent to the space being very $\infty$-thick quasiconvex up to a scale. That is, up to some scale, every pair of points can be joined by a family of quasiconvex curves that is not negligible for the $\infty$-modulus.
  As a first application, we prove a local-to-global improvement for the weak $(1,\infty)$-Poincar\'e inequality for locally complete quasiconvex metric spaces that have a doubling reference measure. As a second application, we apply our results to the existence and uniqueness of $\infty$-harmonic extensions with Lipschitz boundary data for precompact domains in a large class of metric measure spaces. As a final application, we illustrate that in the context of Sobolev extension sets, very $\infty$-thick quasiconvexity up to a scale plays an analogous role as local uniform quasiconvexity does in the Euclidean space.
  Our assumptions are adapted to the analysis of Sobolev extension sets and thus avoid stronger assumptions such as the doubling property of the measure. Examples satisfying our assumptions naturally occur as simplicial complexes, GCBA spaces, and metric quotients of Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>On the reducibility of the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator with a quasi-periodic bounded potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the decay along the diagonal of the matrix representing the perturbation with respect to the Hermite basis, we prove a reducibility result in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ for the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by time quasi-periodic potential, via a KAM iteration. The potential is only bounded (no decay at infinity is required) and its derivative with respect to the spatial variable $x$ is allowed to grow at most like $|x|^\delta$ when $x$ goes to infinity, where the power $\delta&lt;1$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>On analysis of problems of mathematical physics with non-Lipschitz boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in solving problems of mathematical physics on domains with irregular boundaries in Rn. We distinguish two frameworks: a measure-free approach in the image of the trace operator spaces for extension domains and an L2-approach depending on a d-upper regular boundary measure. In both cases, the domains can have boundaries with different Hausdorff dimensions inside the interval (n -- 2, n). The generalization of the Poincar{\'e}-Steklov/Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for these two contexts is given. To illustrate the established convergence of spectral problems for elliptic operators with Robin boundary conditions, we give a numerical example of the stability of localized eigenfunctions, using results of M. Graffin.</description>

      <title>On nonexpansiveness of metric projection operators on Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.01370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate properties of metric projections onto specific closed and geodesically convex proper subsets of Wasserstein spaces $(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbf{R}^d),W_p).$ When $d=1$, as $(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbf{R}),W_2)$ is isometrically isomorphic to a flat space with a Hilbertian structure, the corresponding projection operators are expected to be nonexpansive. We give a direct proof of this fact, relying on intrinsic analysis, which also implies nonexpansiveness in certain special cases in higher dimensions. When $d&gt;1$, we show the failure of this property in two regimes: when $p&gt;1$ is either small enough or large enough. Finally, we prove some positive curvature properties of Wasserstein spaces $(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbf{R}^d),W_p)$ when $d\ge 2$ and $p\in(1,+\infty)$ are arbitrary: we show that Wasserstein spaces are nowhere locally Busemann NPC spaces, and they nowhere locally satisfy the so-called projection criterion. As a corollary of the former, they have nonnegative upper Alexandrov curvature, in a precise sense that we define here. In our analysis a particular subset of probability measures having densities uniformly bounded above by a given constant plays a special role.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

Abstract: The Arens-Michael envelope of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism if and only if the Lie algebra is solvable. The necessity was proved by Pirkovskii in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134, 2621--2631, 2006]. We prove the sufficiency.</description>

      <title>A second order approach to the Kato square root problem on open sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the Kato square root property for coupled second-order elliptic systems in divergence form subject to mixed boundary conditions on an open and possibly unbounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ under two simple geometric conditions: The Dirichlet boundary parts for the respective components are Ahlfors--David regular and a quantitative connectivity property in the spirit of locally uniform domains holds near the remaining Neumann boundary parts. In contrast to earlier work, our proof is not based on the first-order approach due to Axelsson--Keith--McIntosh but uses a second-order approach in the spirit of the original solution to the Kato square root problem on Euclidean space. This way, the proof becomes substantially shorter and technically less demanding.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study a new family of tensor tomography problems. At rank 2 it corresponds to linearization of travel time of elastic waves, measured for all polarizations. We provide a kernel characterization for ranks up to 2. The kernels consist of potential tensors, but in an unusual sense: the associated differential operators have degree 2 instead of the familiar 1. The proofs are based on Fourier analysis, Helmholtz decompositions, and cohomology.</description>

      <title>Moments, Sums of Squares, and Tropicalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tropicalization to study the duals to cones of nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares on a semialgebraic set $S$. The truncated cones of moments of measures supported on the set $S$ is dual to nonnegative polynomials on $S$, while "pseudo-moments" are dual to sums of squares approximations to nonnegative polynomials. We provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tropicalizations of the moment and pseudo-moment cones, and demonstrate their usefulness in distinguishing between nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares. We give examples that show new limitations of sums of squares approximations of nonnegative polynomials. When the semialgebraic set is defined by binomial inequalites, its moment and pseudo-moment cones are closed under Hadamard product. In this case, their tropicalizations are polyhedral cones that encode all binomial inequalities on the moment and pseudo-moment cones.</description>
