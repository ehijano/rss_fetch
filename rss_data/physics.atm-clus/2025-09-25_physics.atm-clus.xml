      <title>A relativistic coupled-cluster treatment of magnetic hyperfine structure of the $X^2\Pi$ and $A^2\Sigma^+$ states of OH isotopologues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Ab initio}$ calculations of the parallel component of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant have been carried out for hydroxyl radical isotopologues ($^{16,17}$OH(D)) over the internuclear distance range $R \in [0.6, 1.8]$ \r{A}. For the ground electronic state $X^2\Pi$, the HFS functions were evaluated for contributions induced by both oxygen and hydrogen nuclei. In addition, the hydrogen-induced HFS curve was calculated for the excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ state. The quantum-chemistry study employs a four-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations up to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes was studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative calculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions represent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date exhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced HFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational levels ($v\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged $\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within $1\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range over which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous studies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of higher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and non-adiabatic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Realization of Graphene Quantum Dots for Innovative Biosensor Development and Diverse Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum dots (QDs), which are miniature semiconductor structures with remarkable optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement processes. Traditional QDs, such as CdTe, have been extensively investigated; however, they frequently exhibit toxicity and stability issues. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as a safer and more stable alternative to traditional QDs. GQDs are honeycomb-lattice carbon atoms with unique electronic and optical properties that make them promising candidates for biomedical, electronic, and energy storage applications. GQD synthesis methods (top-down and bottom-up) and their advantages over standard QDs include better photostability, biocompatibility, and configurable band gaps. GQDs are perfect for real-world uses like sensitive biosensing, real-time food safety monitoring, and smart packaging because of their low toxicity, high sensitivity, and affordability. These uses are all essential for cutting down on food grain waste. This emphasizes the growing significance of GQDs in advancing nanotechnology and their potential integration with quantum technologies, paving the door for creative solutions in biosensing, food safety, environmental monitoring, and future quantum electronics.</description>
