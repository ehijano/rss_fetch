      <title>Soliton Synchronization with Randomness: Rogue Waves and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

      <title>Suleimanov-Talanov self-focusing and the hierarchy of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-focusing of wave packets from the point of view of the semiclassical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. A type of finite-time collapse/blowup of the solution of the associated dispersionless limit was investigated by Talanov in the 1960s, and recently Suleimanov identified a special solution of the dispersive problem that formally regularizes the blowup and is related to the hierarchy of the Painlev\'e-III equation. In this paper we approximate the Talanov solutions in the full dispersive equation using a semiclassical soliton ensemble, a sequence of exact reflectionless solutions for a corresponding sequence of values of the semiclassical parameter epsilon tending to zero, approximating the Talanov initial data more and more accurately in the limit as epsilon tends to zero. In this setting, we rigorously establish the validity of the dispersive saturation of the Talanov blowup obtained by Suleimanov. We extend the result to the full hierarchy of higher focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, exhibiting new generalizations of the Talanov initial data that produce such dispersively regularized extreme focusing in both mixed and pure flows. We also argue that generic perturbations of the Talanov initial data lead to a different singularity of the dispersionless limit, namely a gradient catastrophe for which the dispersive regularization is instead based on the tritronqu\'ee solution of the Painlev\'e-I equation and the Peregrine breather solution which appears near points in space time corresponding to the poles of the former transcendental function as shown by Bertola and Tovbis.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>
