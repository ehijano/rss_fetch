      <title>Dual minus partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Dual-minus partial order, get some characterizations of the partial order, and prove that both the dual star partial order and the dual sharp partial order are Dual-minus-type partial orders. Based on the Dual-minus partial order, we introduce the Dual-minus sharp partial order and the Dual-minus star partial order, which are also Dual-minus-type partial orders. In addition, we discuss relationships among the Dual-minus sharp partial order, the D-sharp partial order and the G-sharp partial order(the Dual-minus star partial order, the D-star partial order and the P-star partial order).</description>

      <title>Cluster Algebras and Dilogarithm Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a reasonably self-contained exposition of the fascinating interplay between cluster algebras and the dilogarithm in the recent two decades. The dilogarithm has a long and rich history since Euler. The most intriguing property of the function is that it satisfies various functional relations, which we call dilogarithm identities (DIs). In the 1990s Gliozzi and Tateo conjectured a family of DIs based on root systems, which vastly generalize the classic DIs such as Euler's and Abel's identities. On the other hand, the cluster algebras are a class of commutative algebras introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky around 2000. It turned out that a DI is associated with each period in a cluster pattern of cluster algebra theory. In particular, they solve the conjecture on the DIs by Gliozzi and Tateo. We employ these DIs as the leitmotif and present several proofs, variations, and generalizations of them with various methods and techniques. The quantum DIs are also treated from the unified point of view with the classical ones.</description>

      <title>On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Weyl Algebras and Jordanian Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07021v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\delta$ be a derivation in a $K$-algebra $R$ and let ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ be the isotropy group with respect to the natural conjugation action of $\rm Aut(R)$ of $K$-automorphisms on the set $\rm Der(R)$ of $K$-derivations: that is, the subgroup of automorphisms that commute with the derivation. We explore the characterization of ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ for quantum Weyl algebras and we prove that in the case of the Jordanian plane it is always a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we obtain an arithmetic characterization that allows us to trivially demonstrate that these algebras are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Twisted unipotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure and representation theory of the Hopf algebras ${}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_J$ when $G$ is an affine algebraic unipotent group over $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathrm{dim}(G) = n$ and $J$ is a Hopf $2$-cocycle for $G$. The cotriangular Hopf algebras ${}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_J$ have the same coalgebra structure as $\mathcal{O}(G)$ but a deformed multiplication. We show that they are involutive $n$-step iterated Hopf Ore extensions of derivation type. The 2-cocycle $J$ has as support a closed subgroup $T$ of $G$, and ${}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_J$ is a crossed product $S \#_{\sigma}U(\mathfrak{t})$, where $\mathfrak{t}$ is the Lie algebra of $T$ and $S$ is a deformed coideal subalgebra. The simple ${}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_J$-modules are stratified by a family of factor algebras ${}_J\mathcal{O}(Z_g)_J$, parametrised by the double cosets $TgT$ of $T$ in $G$. The finite dimensional simple ${}_J\mathcal{O}(G)_J$-modules are all 1-dimensional, so form a group $\Gamma$, which we prove to be an explicitly determined closed subgroup of $G$. A selection of examples illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Categorifications of Non-Integer Quivers: Types $H_4$, $H_3$ and $I_2(2n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a weighted unfolding of quivers with real weights, and use this to provide a categorification of mutations of quivers of finite types $H_4$, $H_3$ and $I_2(2n+1)$. In particular, the (un)folding induces a semiring action on the categories associated to the unfolded quivers of types $E_8$, $D_6$ and $A_{2n}$ respectively. We then define the tropical seed pattern on the folded quivers, which includes $c$- and $g$-vectors, and show its compatibility with the unfolding.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture for monotone and MDS-constructible Ferrers diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes were introduced by Etzion and Silberstein in 2009. In their work, they proposed a conjecture on the largest dimension of a space of matrices over a finite field whose nonzero elements are supported on a given Ferrers diagram and all have rank lower bounded by a fixed positive integer $d$. Since stated, the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture has been verified in a number of cases, often requiring additional constraints on the field size or on the minimum rank $d$ in dependence of the corresponding Ferrers diagram. As of today, this conjecture still remains widely open. Using modular methods, we give a constructive proof of the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture for the class of strictly monotone Ferrers diagrams, which does not depend on the minimum rank $d$ and holds over every finite field. In addition, we leverage on the last result to also prove the conjecture for the class of MDS-constructible Ferrers diagrams, without requiring any restriction on the field size.</description>

      <title>Gerstenhaber-Schack Bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $\textbf{Gerstenhaber-Schack bialgebra}$ (GSb) consists of a graded Hopf algebra $A$ together with three multilinear operations $\{\omega^{n,m}\in Hom^{3-m-n}(A^{\otimes m},A^{\otimes n}) :m+n=4\}$ whose sum is a $2$-cocycle in the Gerstenhaber-Schack (G-S) complex of $A$. A $\textbf{G-S extension}$ of $A$ is a GSb containing it. G-S extensions of $A$ are classified up to isomorphism by the degree -1 component of the G-S cohomology group $H_{GS}^{2}(A;A)$. We exhibit a space $X$ and a non-trivial topologically induced GSb structure on $H^{\ast}\left( \Omega X;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right) .$</description>
