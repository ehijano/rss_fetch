      <title>Majorization-Minimization Networks for Inverse Problems: An Application to EEG Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require optimization schemes with strong stability and convergence guarantees. While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines.</description>

      <title>The Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset: A dataset for pulse deinterleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset, a comprehensive dataset to serve both as a benchmark for radar pulse deinterleaving research and as an enabler of new research methods. The dataset addresses the critical problem of separating interleaved radar pulses from multiple unknown emitters for electronic warfare applications and signal intelligence. Our dataset contains a total of 6000 pulse trains over two receiver configurations, totalling to almost 3 billion pulses, featuring realistic scenarios with up to 110 emitters and significant parameter space overlap. To encourage dataset adoption and establish standardised evaluation procedures, we have launched an accompanying Turing Deinterleaving Challenge, for which models need to associate pulses in interleaved pulse trains to the correct emitter by clustering and maximising metrics such as the V-measure. The Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset is one of the first publicly available, comprehensively simulated pulse train datasets aimed to facilitate sophisticated model development in the electronic warfare community</description>

      <title>PENGUIN: General Vital Sign Reconstruction from PPG with Flow Matching State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) plays a crucial role in continuous cardiovascular health monitoring as a non-invasive and cost-effective modality. However, PPG signals are susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, making accurate estimation of vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) challenging. Existing estimation methods are often restricted to a single-task or environment, limiting their generalizability across diverse PPG decoding scenarios. Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring). Our method consistently outperformed both task-specific and general-purpose baselines, demonstrating PENGUIN as a general framework for robust vital sign reconstruction from PPG.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Foundational Model for Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication and sensing. Yet, today's learning-based wireless techniques do not generalize well: most models are task-specific, environment-dependent, and limited to narrow sensing modalities, requiring costly retraining when deployed in new scenarios. This work introduces a task-agnostic, multi-modal foundational model for physical-layer wireless systems that learns transferable, physics-aware representations across heterogeneous modalities, enabling robust generalization across tasks and environments. Our framework employs a physics-guided self-supervised pretraining strategy incorporating a dedicated physical token to capture cross-modal physical correspondences governed by electromagnetic propagation. The learned representations enable efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, including massive multi-antenna optimization, wireless channel estimation, and device localization, using limited labeled data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior generalization, robustness to deployment shifts, and reduced data requirements compared to task-specific baselines.</description>

      <title>Cross-Frequency Bispectral EEG Analysis of Reach-to-Grasp Planning and Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural control of grasping arises from nonlinear interactions across multiple brain rhythms, yet EEG-based motor decoding has largely relied on linear, second-order spectral features. Here, we examine whether higher-order cross-frequency dynamics distinguish motor planning from execution during natural reach-to-grasp behavior. EEG was recorded in a cue-based paradigm during executed precision and power grips, enabling stage-resolved analysis of preparatory and execution-related neural activity.
  Cross-frequency bispectral analysis was used to compute bicoherence matrices across canonical frequency band pairs, from which magnitude- and phase-based features were extracted. Classification, permutation-based feature selection, and within-subject statistical testing showed that execution is characterized by substantially stronger and more discriminative nonlinear coupling than planning, with dominant contributions from beta- and gamma-driven interactions. In contrast, decoding of precision versus power grips achieved comparable performance during planning and execution, indicating that grasp-type representations emerge during planning and persist into execution.
  Spatial and spectral analyses further revealed that informative bispectral features reflect coordinated activity across prefrontal, central, and occipital regions. Despite substantial feature redundancy, effective dimensionality reduction preserved decoding performance. Together, these findings demonstrate that nonlinear cross-frequency coupling provides an interpretable and robust marker of motor planning and execution, extending bispectral EEG analysis to ecologically valid grasping and supporting its relevance for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetic control.</description>

      <title>Structure-Informed Estimation for Pilot-Limited MIMO Channels via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation in wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems faces fundamental pilot overhead limitations in high-dimensional beyond-5G and sixth-generation (6G) scenarios. This paper presents a hybrid tensor-neural architecture that formulates pilot-limited channel estimation as low-rank tensor completion from sparse observations -- a fundamentally different setting from prior tensor methods that assume fully observed received signal tensors. A canonical polyadic (CP) baseline implemented via a projection-based scheme (Tucker completion under partial observations) and Tucker decompositions are compared under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scattering conditions: CP performs well for specular channels matching the multipath model, while Tucker provides greater robustness under model mismatch. A lightweight three-dimensional (3D) U-Net learns residual components beyond the low-rank structure, bridging algebraic models and realistic propagation effects. Empirical recovery threshold analysis shows that sample complexity scales approximately with intrinsic model dimensionality $L(N_r + N_t + N_f)$ rather than ambient tensor size $N_r N_t N_f$, where $L$ denotes the number of dominant propagation paths. Experiments on synthetic channels demonstrate 10-20\,dB normalized mean-square error (NMSE) improvement over least-squares (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) baselines at 5-10\% pilot density, while evaluations on DeepMIMO ray-tracing channels show 24-44\% additional NMSE reduction over pure tensor-based methods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle for Vertex-Time Graph Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an uncertainty principle for graph signals in the vertex-time domain, unifying the classical time-frequency and graph uncertainty principles within a single framework. By defining vertex-time and spectral-frequency spreads, we quantify signal localization across these domains. Our framework identifies a class of signals that achieve maximum concentration in both the spatial and temporal domains. These signals serve as fundamental atoms for a new vertex-time dictionary, enhancing signal reconstruction under practical constraints, such as intermittent data commonly encountered in sensor and social networks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel graph topology inference method leveraging the uncertainty principle. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy, greater robustness to noise, and enhanced graph learning performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Semantic Pilot Design for Data-Aided Channel Estimation Using a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a semantic pilot design for data-aided channel estimation in text-inclusive data transmission, using a large language model (LLM). In this scenario, channel impairments often appear as typographical errors in the decoded text, which can be corrected using an LLM. The proposed method compares the initially decoded text with the LLM-corrected version to identify reliable decoded symbols. A set of selected symbols, referred to as a semantic pilot, is used as an additional pilot for data-aided channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to leverage semantic information for reliable symbol selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional pilot-only estimation, achieving lower normalized mean squared error and phase error of the estimated channel, as well as reduced bit error rate.</description>

      <title>Spatial Angular Pseudo-Derivative Searching: A Single Snapshot Super-resolution Sparse DOA Scheme with Potential for Practical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution, and real-time DOA estimation is a cornerstone of environmental perception in automotive radar systems. While sparse signal recovery techniques offer super-resolution and high-precision estimation, their prohibitive computational complexity remains a primary bottleneck for practical deployment. This paper proposes a sparse DOA estimation scheme specifically tailored for the stringent requirements of automotive radar such as limited computational resources, restricted array apertures, and a single snapshot. By introducing the concept of the spatial angular pseudo-derivative and incorporating this property as a constraint into a standard L0-norm minimization problem, we formulate an objective function that more faithfully characterizes the physical properties of the DOA problem. The associated solver, designated as the SAPD search algorithm, naturally transforms the high-dimensional optimization task into an efficient grid-search scheme. The SAPD algorithm circumvents high-order matrix inversions and computationally intensive iterations. We provide an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the SAPD method achieves a superior balance of real-time efficiency, high precision, and super-resolution, making it highly suitable for next-generation automotive radar applications.</description>

      <title>GPINND: A deep-learning-based state of health estimation for Lithium-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical models offer superior interpretability and reliability for battery degradation diagnosis. However, the high computational cost of iterative parameter identification severely hinders the practical implementation of electrochemically informed state of health (SOH) estimation in real-time systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an SOH estimation method that integrates deep learning with electrochemical mechanisms and adopts a sequential training strategy. First, we construct a hybrid-driven surrogate model to learn internal electrochemical dynamics by fusing high-fidelity simulation data with physical constraints. This model subsequently serves as an accurate and differentiable physical kernel for voltage reconstruction. Then, we develop a self-supervised framework to train a parameter identification network by minimizing the voltage reconstruction error. The resulting model enables the non-iterative identification of aging parameters from external measurements. Finally, utilizing the identified parameters as physicochemical health indicators, we establish a high-precision SOH estimation network that leverages data-driven residual correction to compensate for identification deviations. Crucially, a sequential training strategy is applied across these modules to effectively mitigate convergence issues and improve the accuracy of each module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average voltage reconstruction root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0198 V and an SOH estimation RMSE of 0.0014.</description>

      <title>Maneuverable-Jamming-Aided Secure Communication and Sensing in A2G-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a maneuverablejamming-aided secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (A2G-ISAC) system, where a dual-functional source UAV and a maneuverable jamming UAV operate collaboratively in a hybrid monostatic-bistatic radar configuration. The maneuverable jamming UAV emits artificial noise to assist the source UAV in detecting multiple ground targets while interfering with an eavesdropper. The effects of residual interference caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are considered, which degrades the system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR) under transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraints, and sensing requirements, the dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming are jointly optimized. Given that secure communication and sensing fundamentally conflict in terms of resource allocation, making it difficult to achieve optimal performance for both simultaneously, we adopt a two-phase design to address this challenge. By dividing the mission into the secure communication (SC) phase and the SCS phase, the A2G-ISAC system can focus on optimizing distinct objectives separately. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm employing the trust-region successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation iteratively optimizes dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming. For the SCS phase, a weighted distance minimization problem determines the suitable dual-UAV sensing positions by a greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the highest ASR among benchmarks while maintaining robust sensing performance, and confirm the impact of the SIC residual interference on both secure communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Aortic Valve Disease Detection from PPG via Physiology-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional diagnosis of aortic valve disease relies on echocardiography, but its cost and required expertise limit its use in large-scale early screening. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease.</description>

      <title>Joint Fractional Delay and Doppler Frequency Estimator Under Spectrum Wrapping Phenomenon for LEO-ICAN AFDM Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the design of integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) signals has attracted increasing attention, especially in the field of vehicle-to-everything (V2X). As a new-generation waveform, Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) features high robustness against Doppler effects, a simple modulation structure, and low pilot overhead, making it a promising candidate for high-dynamic LEO satellite scenarios. However, LEO-ICAN AFDM signals face challenges in fractional delay and Doppler frequency estimation. Existing studies that ignore its inherent spectrum wrapping phenomenon may lead to deviations of varying degrees in model construction. This paper conducts an in-depth derivation of AFDM's input-output relationship under fractional cases, reveals the envelope characteristics of its equivalent channel, and proposes a joint estimation algorithm based on peak-to-sidelobe power ratio (PSPR) detection and early-late gate (ELG) to estimate fractional Doppler frequency and delay. Simulations show that the algorithm has low complexity, low guard interval overhead, and high precision compared with traditional methods.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Polar-Domain Dictionary Design for Elevated BSs in Near-Field U-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field U-MIMO communications require carefully optimized sampling grids in both angular and distance domains. However, most existing grid design methods neglect the influence of base station height, assuming instead that the base station is positioned at ground level - a simplification that rarely reflects real-world deployments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalized grid design framework that accommodates arbitrary base station locations. Unlike conventional correlation-based approaches, our method optimizes the grid based on the minimization of the optimal normalized mean squared error, leading to more accurate channel representation. We evaluate the performance of a hybrid U-MIMO system operating at sub-THz frequencies, considering the P-SOMP algorithm for channel estimation. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed design enhances both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Localization via Gaussian Belief Propagation with Quadratic Angle Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) is a technique that relies on linearized error and input-output models to yield low-complexity solutions to complex estimation problems, which has been recently shown to be effective in the design of range-based GaBP schemes for stationary and moving rigid body localization (RBL) in three-dimensional (3D) space, as long as an accurate prior on the orientation of the target rigid body is available. In this article we present a novel range-based RBL scheme via GaBP that removes the latter limitation. To this end, the proposed method incorporates a quadratic angle approximation to linearize the relative orientation between the prior and the target rigid body, enabling high precision estimates of corresponding rotation angles even for large deviations. Leveraging the resulting linearized model, we derive the corresponding message-passing (MP) rules to obtain estimates of the translation vector and rotation matrix of the target rigid body, relative to a prior reference frame. Numerical results corroborate the good performance of the proposed angle approximation itself, as well as the consequent RBL performance in terms of root mean square errors (RMSEs) in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SotA), while maintaining a low computational complexity</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Detector for Multiple Scatterers in SAR Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent scatterer interferometry and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tomography are powerful tools for the detection and time monitoring of persistent scatterers. They have been proven to be effective in urban scenarios, especially for buildings and infrastructures 3-D reconstruction and monitoring of deformation. In urban areas, occurrence of layover leads to the presence of multiple contributions within the same image pixel from scatterers located at different heights. In the context of SAR Tomography, this problem can be addressed by considering a multiple hypothesis test to detect the presence of feasible multiple scatterers [1][2]. In the present paper, we consider this problem in the framework of the information theory and exploit the theoretical tool, developed in [3], to design a one-stage adaptive architecture for multiple hypothesis testing problems in the context of SAR Tomography. Moreover, we resort to the compressive sensing approach for the estimation of the unknown parameters under each hypothesis. This architecture has been verified on both simulated as well as real data also in comparison with suitable counterparts.</description>

      <title>Total Variation Sparse Bayesian Learning for Block Sparsity via Majorization-Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block sparsity is a widely exploited structure in sparse recovery, offering significant gains when signal blocks are known. Yet, practical signals often exhibit unknown block boundaries and isolated non-zero entries, which challenge traditional approaches. A promising method to handle such complex sparsity patterns is the difference-of-logs total variation (DoL-TV) regularized sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). However, due to the complex form of DoL-TV term, the resulting optimization problem is hard to solve. This paper develops a new optimization framework for the DoL-TV SBL cost function. By introducing an exponential reparameterization of the SBL hyperparameters, we reveal a novel structure that admits a majorization-minimization formulation and naturally extends to unknown noise variance estimation. Sparse recovery results on both synthetic data and extended source direction-of-arrival estimation demonstrate improved accuracy and runtime performance compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Separate RF Signals Under Uncertainty: Detect-Then-Separate vs. Unified Joint Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum forces communication signals to coexist, creating heterogeneous interferers whose structure often departs from Gaussian models. Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes.</description>

      <title>HFMCA: Orthonormal Feature Learning for EEG-based Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is critical for brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience, but the intrinsic noise and high dimensionality of EEG signals hinder effective feature learning. We propose a self-supervised framework based on the Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA), which learns orthonormal EEG representations by enforcing feature decorrelation and reducing redundancy. This design enables robust capture of essential brain dynamics for various EEG recognition tasks. We validate HFMCA on two benchmark datasets, SEED and BCIC-2A, where pretraining with HFMCA consistently outperforms competitive self-supervised baselines, achieving notable gains in classification accuracy. Across diverse EEG tasks, our method demonstrates superior cross-subject generalization under leave-one-subject-out validation, advancing state-of-the-art by 2.71\% on SEED emotion recognition and 2.57\% on BCIC-2A motor imagery classification.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for mmWave Beam Prediction Using Sub-6 GHz Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming in millimeter-wave (mmWave) high-mobility environments typically incurs substantial training overhead. While prior studies suggest that sub-6 GHz channels can be exploited to predict optimal mmWave beams, existing methods depend on large deep learning (DL) models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for sub-6 GHz channel-mmWave beam mapping based on the knowledge distillation (KD) technique. We develop two compact student DL architectures based on individual and relational distillation strategies, which retain only a few hidden layers yet closely mimic the performance of large teacher DL models. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed student models achieve the teacher's beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency while reducing trainable parameters and computational complexity by 99%.</description>

      <title>Resilient Channel Charting Under Varying Radio Link Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting (CC) has become a key technology for RF-based localization, enabling unsupervised radio fingerprinting, even in non line of sight scenarios, with a minimum of reference position labels. However, most CC models assume fixed-size inputs, such as a constant number of antennas or channel measurements. In practical systems, antennas may fail, signals may be blocked, or antenna sets may change during handovers, making fixed-input architectures fragile. Existing radio-fingerprinting approaches address this by training separate models for each antenna configuration, but the resulting training effort scales prohibitively with the array size. We propose Adaptive Positioning (AdaPos), a CC architecture that natively handles variable numbers of channel measurements. AdaPos combines convolutional feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder using learnable antenna identifiers and self-attention to fuse arbitrary subsets of CSI inputs. Experiments on two public real-world datasets (SISO and MIMO) show that AdaPos maintains state-of-the-art accuracy under missing-antenna conditions and replaces roughly 57 configuration-specific models with a single unified model. With AdaPos and our novel training strategies, we provide resilience to both individual antenna failures and full-array outages.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Transformer for Joint Multi-Receiver Uplink Neural Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cross-attention Transformer for joint decoding of uplink OFDM signals received by multiple coordinated access points. A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.</description>

      <title>Safe-NEureka: a Hybrid Modular Redundant DNN Accelerator for On-board Satellite AI Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are revolutionizing the space sector, with on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming pivotal for next-generation satellites. AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Enhancing PPG-Based Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $&lt;$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $&lt;$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04795v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description>

      <title>19.3 GHz Acoustic Filter with High Close-in Rejection in Tri-layer Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic filters are preferred front-end solutions at sub-6 GHz due to their superior frequency selectivity compared to electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. With the ongoing development of 5G and the evolution toward 6G, there is a growing need to extend acoustic filter technologies into frequency range 3 (FR3), which spans 7 to 24 GHz to accommodate emerging high-frequency bands. However, scaling acoustic filters beyond 10 GHz presents significant challenges, as conventional platforms suffer from increased insertion loss (IL) and degraded out-of-band (OoB) rejection at higher frequencies. Recent innovations have led to the emergence of periodically poled piezoelectric lithium niobate (P3F LN) laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs), offering low-loss and high electromechanical coupling performance above 10 GHz. This work presents the first tri-layer P3F LN filter operating at 19.3 GHz, achieving a low IL of 2.2 dB, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 8.5%, and an impressive 49 dB close in rejection. These results demonstrate strong potential for integration into FR3 diplexers.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Over-the-Air-Computing for Multimodal Dual-Stream Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quadrature over-the-air computing (Q-OTAC) framework that enables the simultaneously computation of two independent functions and/or data stream within a single transmission. In contrast to conventional OTAC schemes, where a single function is computed by treating each complex signal as a single component, the proposed Q-OTAC exploits both in-phase and quadrature (IQ) components of a complex signal, encoding two distinct functions and/or data streams at the edge devices (EDs) and employing a novel low-complexity IQ-decoupled combiner at the access point (AP) to independently recover each stream, which effectively doubles the computation rate. A key strength of this framework lies in its simplicity and broad compatibility: the extension into the quadrature domain is conceptually straightforward, yet remakably powerful, allowing seamless integration into existing OTAC techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this approach, including the first demonstration of dual-function aggregation (e.g., parallel summation and product), highlighting the potential of Q-OTAC for enabling multi-modal and high-efficiency beyond fifth generation (B5G) applications.</description>

Abstract: Decoding the attended speaker in a multi-speaker environment from electroencephalography (EEG) has attracted growing interest in recent years, with neuro-steered hearing devices as a driver application. Current approaches typically rely on ground-truth labels of the attended speaker during training, necessitating calibration sessions for each user and each EEG set-up to achieve optimal performance. While unsupervised self-adaptive auditory attention decoding (AAD) for stimulus reconstruction has been developed to eliminate the need for labeled data, it suffers from an initialization bias that can compromise performance. Although an unbiased variant has been proposed to address this limitation, it introduces substantial computational complexity that scales with data size. This paper presents three computationally efficient alternatives that achieve comparable performance, but with a significantly lower and constant computational cost. The code for the proposed algorithms is available at https://github.com/YYao-42/Unsupervised_AAD.</description>

      <title>Statistics Approximation-Enabled Distributed Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a distributed beamforming approach for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, referred to as Global Statistics &amp; Local Instantaneous information-based minimum mean-square error (GSLI-MMSE). The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path.</description>

      <title>Dictionary Learning under Symmetries via Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous ECG-PCG Acquisition System with Real-Time Burst-Adaptive Noise Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds. However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Most of the existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either non-real-time or computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. We employ a burst adaptive normalized least mean square algorithm that adjusts its adaptation in response to high-energy, non-stationary hospital noise. The algorithm's performance was initially assessed using datasets with artificially induced noise. Subsequently, the complete end-to-end system was validated using real-world hospital recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed system achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. Furthermore, complexity analysis confirms the pipeline's suitability for embedded implementation. These results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening in noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>On the Tail Transition of First Arrival Position Channels: From Cauchy to Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the zero-drift first arrival position (FAP) channel is known to exhibit a Cauchy noise distribution, practical molecular communication systems typically operate under nonzero drift. This letter analyzes the resulting transition in FAP noise behavior from heavy-tailed algebraic decay to exponential regularization. By asymptotically examining the exact FAP distribution, we identify a characteristic propagation distance (CPD) $r_c=\sigma^2/v$ that separates diffusion-dominated and drift-dominated regimes. Numerical results show that in low-drift environments, Gaussian approximations substantially underestimate the achievable rate, whereas the zero-drift Cauchy model provides a physically grounded performance baseline.</description>

      <title>Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response Under Uniform Drift for Absorbing Spherical Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact channel impulse response (CIR) for the three-dimensional point-to-sphere absorbing channel under drift has remained unavailable due to symmetry breaking. This letter closes this gap by deriving an exact analytical CIR for a fully absorbing spherical receiver under uniform drift with arbitrary direction. By formulating the problem in terms of joint first-hitting time-location statistics and applying a Girsanov-based measure change, drift effects are isolated into an explicit multiplicative factor, yielding an exact series representation. The resulting CIR provides a rigorous reference model and enables efficient, noise-free evaluation of key channel metrics without relying on Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Combining Residual U-Net and Data Augmentation for Dense Temporal Segmentation of Spike Wave Discharges in Single-Channel EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manual annotation of spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, is labor-intensive for long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies. While machine learning approaches show promise for automated detection, they often struggle with cross-subject generalization due to high inter-individual variability in seizure morphology and signal characteristics. In this study we compare the performance of 15 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs and find that a 1D U-Net performs the best. We then improve its performance by employing residual connections and data augmentation strategies combining amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise injection, and signal inversion during training to enhance cross-subject generalization. We also compare our method, named AugUNet1D, to a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks" and show that AugUNet1D performs better on our dataset. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for other users.</description>

      <title>Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifolds: A Framework for Cross-Domain Representation Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 78.76% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion determines when different semantic-observation pairs share compatible latent structure, enabling principled unification into universal representations and providing a mathematical foundation for decomposing general foundation models into domain-specific components.</description>
