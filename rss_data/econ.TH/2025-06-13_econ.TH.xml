      <title>Seeding an Uncertain Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study how a startup with uncertainty over product quality and no knowledge of the underlying diffusion network optimally chooses initial seeds. To ensure widespread adoption when the product is good while minimizing negative perceptions when it is bad, the optimal number of initial seeds should grow logarithmically with network size. When there are agents of different types that govern their connectivity, it is asymptotically optimal to seed agents of a single type: the type that minimizes the marginal cost per probability of making the product go viral. These results rationalize startup behavior in practice.</description>

      <title>The pursuit of happiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population to a cooperative state.</description>

      <title>Cursed Equilibria and Knightian Uncertainty in a Trading Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel equilibrium concept that incorporates Knightian uncertainty into the cursed equilibrium (Eyster and Rabin, 2005). This concept is then applied to a two-player game in which agents can engage in trade or refuse to do so. While the Bayesian Nash equilibrium predicts that trade never happens, players do trade in a cursed equilibrium. The inclusion of uncertainty enhances this effect for cursed and uncertainty averse players. This contrasts general findings that uncertainty reduces trade but is consistent with behavior that has been observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Growth: An Extension of the Solow-Swan Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function stands as a central element in the renowned Solow-Swan model in economics, providing a crucial theoretical framework for comprehending the determinants of economic growth. This model not only guides policymakers and economists but also influences their decisions, fostering sustainable and inclusive development. In this study, we utilize a one-input version of a new generalization of the Cobb-Douglas production function proposed recently, thereby extending the Solow-Swan model to incorporate energy production as a factor. We offer a rationale for this extension and conduct a comprehensive analysis employing advanced mathematical tools to explore solutions to this new model. This approach allows us to effectively integrate environmental considerations related to energy production into economic growth strategies, fostering long-term sustainability.</description>
