      <title>Chiral Phonons in Graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dependence of Phonon-Induced Current Noise in ArmchairCarbon Nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the frequency dependence of phonon-induced current noise in armchair carbon nanotubes at room temperature. Our results reveal the emergence of multiple resonance peaks in the high-frequency regime, which cannot be accounted for by the Lorentzian lineshape expected from a Markovian process. The electron-phonon scattering processes responsible for most of these peaks are identified based on energy and momentum conservation laws and conventional selection rules. However, certain peaks cannot be fully explained within the framework of harmonic phonon scattering, suggesting the involvement of nontrivial interactions between electrons and anharmonic phonons.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Current Noise Induced by Electron-Phonon Scattering in Metallic Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate current noise in metallic carbon nanotubes induced by electron-phonon scattering, focusing on the probability density function (PDF) of the current that characterizes the nonequilibrium steady state. Quantum transport simulations combined with analyses of higher-order statistical moments reveal that the PDF evolves continuously from a Gaussian distribution in the ballistic regime to a non-Gaussian gamma distribution in the diffusive regime. In the crossover regime, the PDF exhibits pronounced asymmetry, attributed to a statistical imbalance in the number of conduction pathways contributing to high- and low-current events. Furthermore, in the diffusive regime, we identify non-Markovian features arising from high-frequency resonances in the current noise, which dominate the asymptotic scaling behavior of the current variance.</description>

      <title>Optically Controlled Skyrmion Number Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to control the motion of magnetic Skyrmions through the generation of a Skyrmion number current. This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend solely on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Induced Steady States in Topological Superconductors: Mechanisms and Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for conditions supporting degenerate steady states in nonequilibrium topological superconductors is important for advancing dissipative quantum engineering, a field that has attracted significant research attention over the past decade. In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Realistic modelling of transport properties at finite tempeature in magnetic materials by local quantization of a Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative description of the electrical resistivity of a magnetic material remains challenging to this day. Qualitatively, it is well understood that the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached good agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach for non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the resistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of magnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the missing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder itself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \textit{ab-initio} transport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder. Using the example of $\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local quantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of the spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous approaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order effects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie temperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably predicted a constant contribution.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge-current conversion in altermagnetic candidate RuO$_2$ probed by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the THz emission spectroscopy, we investigate ultrafast spin-to-charge current conversion in epitaxial thin films of the altermagnetic candidate RuO$_2$. We perform a quantitative analysis of competing effects that can contribute to the measured anisotropic THz emission. These include the anisotropic inverse spin splitter and spin Hall effects in RuO$_2$, the anisotropic conductivity of RuO$_2$, and the birefringence of the TiO$_2$ substrate. We observe that the leading contribution to the measured signals comes from the anisotropic inverse spin Hall effect, with an average spin-Hall angle of $2.4\times 10^{-3}$ at room temperature. In comparison, a possible contribution from the altermagnetic inverse spin-splitter effect is found to be below $2\times 10^{-4}$. Our work stresses the importance of carefully disentangling spin-dependent phenomena that can be generated by the unconventional altermagnetic order, from the effects of the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally deficient topological square-root insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most surprising features of effectively non-Hermitian physical systems is their potential to exhibit a striking nonlinear response and fragility to small perturbations. This feature arises from spectral singularities known as exceptional points, whose realization in the spectrum typically requires fine-tuning of parameters. The design of such systems receives significant impetus from the recent conception of \emph{exceptional deficiency}, in which the entire energy spectrum is composed of exceptional points. Here, we present a concrete and transparent mechanism that enforces exceptional deficiency through lattice sum rules in non-Hermitian topological square-root insulators. We identify the resulting dynamical signatures in static broadband amplification and non-Abelian adiabatic state amplification, differentiate between bulk and boundary effects, and outline routes to implementation in physical platforms</description>

      <title>Gating upconversion electroluminescence in a single molecule via adsorption-induced interaction of unpaired spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules with unpaired spins (radicals) offer promising alternatives to closed-shell molecules as they are less limited regarding the spin statistics in their electroluminescence. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence and density functional theory to study single vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules, which are stable neutral radicals. Two distinct adsorption geometries of the molecule on NaCl/Au(111) lead to a difference in the interaction of the unpaired electron with the substrate, which in turn allows us to investigate its effects on the light emission process. Remarkably, we observe that up-conversion electroluminescence is gated by the adsorption geometry of the molecule, an effect we attribute to a reordering of excited states and enhanced excited state transition probabilities. The profound influence of the unpaired electron via state reordering opens new possibilities for tuning not only molecular electroluminescence but also many other spin dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

      <title>Gapped spinful phases obtained via Gutzwiller projections of Euler states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for coated plasmonic particles: effects of shape and size-corrected dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, modal expansion methods (MEMs) were developed to accurately predict the extinction and scattering spectra of bare and coated plasmonic particles. However, it remains uncertain whether the accuracy of analytical models is preserved when incorporating size-corrected dielectric functions. We compare numerical (COMSOL) and analytical extinction and scattering spectra for various particle shapes - rods, disks, prisms, bicones, and bipyramids - using both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. Size correction primarily causes broadening and a reduction in the plasmonic peaks. Still, the accuracy of analytical models is maintained for all shapes except sharp bicones, where MEM fails for both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. This failure arises from the strong localization of the plasmonic field near the sharp bicone tips. However, for realistic bicone models with nanometer-scale tip curvature, MEM performs well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of temperature-dependent magnetization dynamics is a fundamental challenge in computational magnetism. While Atomistic Spin Dynamics (ASD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for studying magnetic phenomena, their classical nature leads to significant deviations from experimental observations, particularly at low temperatures. Here we present a comprehensive implementation of quantum-corrected ASD into the Vampire software package, based on the open-system Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a quantum thermostat. Our implementation incorporates memory effects along with colored noise derived from quantum-mechanical considerations that improve the description of the equilibrium magnetization. We demonstrate excellent quantitative agreement with experimental magnetization curves for nickel and gadolinium across the full temperature range. Our results establish that incorporating quantum environmental effects and colored noise substantially enhances the predictive capabilities of ASD simulations, providing a robust framework for modeling temperature-dependent magnetic phenomena in localized moment magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Two Dimensional Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions occur when a dynamical free energy becomes non-analytic at critical \emph{times}. They have been shown to exist in, among other systems, topological insulators and superconductors. Additionally in both one dimensional systems and two dimensional higher order topological matter a dynamical analogue of the bulk-boundary correspondence has been observed which is suggestive of a dynamical switching between different phases. If the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial, zeroes of the Loschmidt matrix appear between critical times, leading to significant, periodically occurring contributions to the boundary dynamical free energy. In this article we extend these ideas to two dimensional topological matter by showing that in-gap bands in the spectrum of the Loschmidt matrix between successive critical times exist if the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial. We further show that these in-gap bands are directly responsible for a boundary contribution to the dynamical free energy, thus establishing a dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence in two dimensional topological matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Increasing the proximity induced spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with pressure</title>

Abstract: Combining graphene with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) leads to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the graphene. The induced SOC has a large effect on the low-energy part of the band structure leading to or stabilizing novel phases such as topological phases or superconductivity. Here, the pressure dependence of the SOC strength is investigated in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. We performed magnetoconductance studies, such as weak localization, quantum Hall, and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation measurements to extract the different SOC terms which determine the low-energy band structure of BLG. We find the proximity-induced SOC strengths increased by more than 50\% as a result of applying 2\,GPa hydrostatic pressure. Our studies highlight the opportunity to increase the SOC coupling strength with pressure, which can be important for correlated phases or spin qubits in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator nano-SQUID: Flux-tunable platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Vibration-assisted tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 5 K was used to study individual Au atoms adsorbed on the surface of a WSe2 layer grown on epitaxial graphene. In line with theoretical predictions, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal that the weakly bound adatom gives rise to an electronic state within the energy band gap of the WSe2 layer. Adatoms in different surface locations show different gap-state energy values that follow a random distribution around the Fermi level of the sample with a standard deviation of ~50 meV. The location-dependent shift is attributed to spatial variations in disorder potential. Tunneling via the gap state is accompanied by vibrational excitations as apparent from pronounced sideband peaks in the conductance spectra with Poisson-distributed intensities indicating significant electron-phonon coupling with a Huang-Rhys factor of S=2.8. STM tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2 constitutes a model case of resonant double-barrier tunneling accompanied by strong coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>
