      <title>Role of non-extensivity $q$-parameter in tectonic seismic forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By writing total Tsallis entropy as a function of non-extensivity q-parameter withing the fragment-asperity model for earthquakes, a critical range of values is identified: 1.4 &lt;q&lt; 1.8. It comes directly from constructing the non-extensive entropy with the assumption that the energy of stress-bearing interactions, which the probability distribution depends on, is proportional to the surface of contact. Such interval of q-values corresponds to the strong variation of entropy and contains the most of reported results for this parameter determined for main-shocks around the world in recent decades, indicating the role of q as a seismic risk factor. Although this knowledge is clearly not enough to elaborate a procedure to predict the occurrence of intense and devastating tectonic earthquakes, it may serve as a relevant element of consideration.</description>

      <title>Salt-Rock Creep Deformation Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks and Analytical Models for Subsurface Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data. Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a 15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models, effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity and representation theorems for rotational seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing rotational motion measurements for seismic source inversion, structural imaging and ambient noise analysis. We derive reciprocity and representation theorems for rotational motion. The representations express the rotational motion inside an inhomogeneous anisotropic earth in terms of translational and rotational motion at the surface. The theorems contribute to the theoretical basis for rotational seismology methodology, such as determining the moment tensor of earthquake sources.</description>
