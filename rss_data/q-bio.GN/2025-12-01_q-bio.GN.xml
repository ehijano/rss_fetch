      <title>deepFEPS: Deep Learning-Oriented Feature Extraction for Biological Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine- and deep-learning approaches for biological sequences depend critically on transforming raw DNA, RNA, and protein FASTA files into informative numerical representations. However, this process is often fragmented across multiple libraries and preprocessing steps, which creates a barrier for researchers without extensive computational expertise. To address this gap, we developed deepFEPS, an open-source toolkit that unifies state-of-the-art feature extraction methods for sequence data within a single, reproducible workflow. deepFEPS integrates five families of modern feature extractors - k-mer embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText), document-level embeddings (Doc2Vec), transformer-based encoders (DNABERT, ProtBERT, and ESM2), autoencoder-derived latent features, and graph-based embeddings - into one consistent platform. The system accepts FASTA input via a web interface or command-line tool, exposes key model parameters, and outputs analysis-ready feature matrices (CSV). Each run is accompanied by an automatic quality-control report including sequence counts, dimensionality, sparsity, variance distributions, class balance, and diagnostic visualizations. By consolidating advanced sequence embeddings into one environment, deepFEPS reduces preprocessing overhead, improves reproducibility, and shortens the path from raw sequences to downstream machine- and deep-learning applications. deepFEPS lowers the practical barrier to modern representation learning for bioinformatics, enabling both novice and expert users to generate advanced embeddings for classification, clustering, and predictive modeling. Its unified framework supports exploratory analyses, high-throughput studies, and integration into institutional workflows, while remaining extensible to emerging models and methods.

      <title>PathGene: Benchmarking Driver Gene Mutations and Exon Prediction Using Multicenter Lung Cancer Histopathology Image Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.
