      <title>Online Inference of Constrained Optimization: Primal-Dual Optimality and Sequential Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online statistical inference for the solutions of stochastic optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of H\'ajek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>WTNN: Weibull-Tailored Neural Networks for survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weibull distribution is a commonly adopted choice for modeling the survival of systems subject to maintenance over time. When only proxy indicators and censored observations are available, it becomes necessary to express the distribution's parameters as functions of time-dependent covariates. Deep neural networks provide the flexibility needed to learn complex relationships between these covariates and operational lifetime, thereby extending the capabilities of traditional regression-based models. Motivated by the analysis of a fleet of military vehicles operating in highly variable and demanding environments, as well as by the limitations observed in existing methodologies, this paper introduces WTNN, a new neural network-based modeling framework specifically designed for Weibull survival studies. The proposed architecture is specifically designed to incorporate qualitative prior knowledge regarding the most influential covariates, in a manner consistent with the shape and structure of the Weibull distribution. Through numerical experiments, we show that this approach can be reliably trained on proxy and right-censored data, and is capable of producing robust and interpretable survival predictions that can improve existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust and Sparse Estimation of Unbounded Density Ratio under Heavy Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the non-asymptotic properties of robust density ratio estimation (DRE) in contaminated settings. Weighted DRE is the most promising among existing methods, exhibiting doubly strong robustness from an asymptotic perspective. This study demonstrates that Weighted DRE achieves sparse consistency even under heavy contamination within a non-asymptotic framework. This method addresses two significant challenges in density ratio estimation and robust estimation. For density ratio estimation, we provide the non-asymptotic properties of estimating unbounded density ratios under the assumption that the weighted density ratio function is bounded. For robust estimation, we introduce a non-asymptotic framework for doubly strong robustness under heavy contamination, assuming that at least one of the following conditions holds: (i) contamination ratios are small, and (ii) outliers have small weighted values. This work provides the first non-asymptotic analysis of strong robustness under heavy contamination.</description>

      <title>Impact of Positional Encoding: Clean and Adversarial Rademacher Complexity for Transformers under In-Context Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional encoding (PE) is a core architectural component of Transformers, yet its impact on the Transformer's generalization and robustness remains unclear. In this work, we provide the first generalization analysis for a single-layer Transformer under in-context regression that explicitly accounts for a completely trainable PE module. Our result shows that PE systematically enlarges the generalization gap. Extending to the adversarial setting, we derive the adversarial Rademacher generalization bound. We find that the gap between models with and without PE is magnified under attack, demonstrating that PE amplifies the vulnerability of models. Our bounds are empirically validated by a simulation study. Together, this work establishes a new framework for understanding the clean and adversarial generalization in ICL with PE.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Stochastic Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) map is a geometry-driven transformation between high-dimensional probability distributions which underpins a wide range of tasks in statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Tabular Data: A Training Perspective of Self-Attention via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis examines self-attention training through the lens of Optimal Transport (OT) and develops an OT-based alternative for tabular classification. The study tracks intermediate projections of the self-attention layer during training and evaluates their evolution using discrete OT metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Monge gap, optimality, and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset.
  Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping. The method achieves accuracy comparable to Transformers while reducing computational cost and scaling more efficiently under standardized inputs, though its performance depends on careful dummy-geometry design. All experiments and implementations are conducted in R.</description>

      <title>Don't Throw Away Your Beams: Improving Consistency-based Uncertainties in LLMs via Beam Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency-based methods have emerged as an effective approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models. These methods typically rely on several generations obtained via multinomial sampling, measuring their agreement level. However, in short-form QA, multinomial sampling is prone to producing duplicates due to peaked distributions, and its stochasticity introduces considerable variance in uncertainty estimates across runs. We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling. We empirically evaluate our approach on six QA datasets and find that its consistent improvements over multinomial sampling lead to state-of-the-art UQ performance.</description>

      <title>Supervised learning pays attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning with attention enables large neural networks to make context-specific predictions by selectively focusing on relevant examples. Here, we adapt this idea to supervised learning procedures such as lasso regression and gradient boosting, for tabular data. Our goals are to (1) flexibly fit personalized models for each prediction point and (2) retain model simplicity and interpretability.
  Our method fits a local model for each test observation by weighting the training data according to attention, a supervised similarity measure that emphasizes features and interactions that are predictive of the outcome. Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Algorithms for Mobile Health Interventions with Active Querying Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning in mobile health (mHealth) interventions requires balancing intervention efficacy with user burden, particularly when state measurements (for example, user surveys or feedback) are costly yet essential. The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.</description>

      <title>DW-KNN: A Transparent Local Classifier Integrating Distance Consistency and Neighbor Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most used ML classifiers. However, if we observe closely, standard distance-weighted KNN and relative variants assume all 'k' neighbors are equally reliable. In heterogeneous feature space, this becomes a limitation that hinders reliability in predicting true levels of the observation.
  We propose DW-KNN (Double Weighted KNN), a transparent and robust variant that integrates exponential distance with neighbor validity. This enables instance-level interpretability, suppresses noisy or mislabeled samples, and reduces hyperparameter sensitivity.
  Comprehensive evaluation on 9 data-sets helps to demonstrate that DW-KNN achieves 0.8988 accuracy on average. It ranks 2nd among six methods and within 0.2% of the best-performing Ensemble KNN. It also exhibits the lowest cross-validation variance (0.0156), indicating reliable prediction stability. Statistical significance test confirmed ($p &lt; 0.001$) improvement over compactness weighted KNN (+4.09\%) and Kernel weighted KNN (+1.13\%). The method provides a simple yet effective alternative to complex adaptive schemes, particularly valuable for high-stakes applications requiring explainable predictions.</description>

      <title>All Emulators are Wrong, Many are Useful, and Some are More Useful Than Others: A Reproducible Comparison of Computer Model Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient surrogate modeling is essential for modern computational science, and there are a staggering number of emulation methods to choose from. With new methods being developed all the time, comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods remains a challenge due to inconsistent benchmarking practices and (sometimes) limited reproducibility and transparency. In this work, we present a large-scale, fully reproducible comparison of $29$ distinct emulators across $60$ canonical test functions and $40$ real emulation datasets. To facilitate rigorous, apples-to-apples comparisons, we introduce the R package \texttt{duqling}, which streamlines reproducible simulation studies using a consistent, simple syntax, and automatic internal scaling of inputs. This framework allows researchers to compare emulators in a unified environment and makes it possible to replicate or extend previous studies with minimal effort, even across different publications. Our results provide detailed empirical insight into the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art emulators and offer guidance for both method developers and practitioners selecting a surrogate for new data. We discuss best practices for emulator comparison and highlight how \texttt{duqling} can accelerate research in emulator design and application.</description>

      <title>Banach neural operator for Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical neural networks are known for their ability to approximate mappings between finite-dimensional spaces, but they fall short in capturing complex operator dynamics across infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hype: Comparing Lightweight and Deep Learning Models for Air Quality Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of urban air pollution is essential for protecting public health and guiding mitigation policies. While Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid pipelines dominate recent research, their complexity and limited interpretability hinder operational use. This study investigates whether lightweight additive models -- Facebook Prophet (FBP) and NeuralProphet (NP) -- can deliver competitive forecasts for particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) in Beijing, China. Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants. These findings demonstrate that interpretable additive models remain competitive with both traditional and complex approaches, offering a practical balance of accuracy, transparency, and ease of deployment.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Mean-Variance with Jumps: An Equilibrium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revisiting the continuous-time Mean-Variance (MV) Portfolio Optimization problem, we model the market dynamics with a jump-diffusion process and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to facilitate informed exploration within the control space. We recognize the time-inconsistency of the MV problem and adopt the time-inconsistent control (TIC) approach to analytically solve for an exploratory equilibrium investment policy, which is a Gaussian distribution centered on the equilibrium control of the classical MV problem. Our approach accounts for time-inconsistent preferences and actions, and our equilibrium policy is the best option an investor can take at any given time during the investment period. Moreover, we leverage the martingale properties of the equilibrium policy, design a RL model, and propose an Actor-Critic RL algorithm. All of our RL model parameters converge to the corresponding true values in a simulation study. Our numerical study on 24 years of real market data shows that the proposed RL model is profitable in 13 out of 14 tests, demonstrating its practical applicability in real world investment.</description>

      <title>Debiased Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been significant progress in Bayesian inference based on sparsity-inducing (e.g., spike-and-slab and horseshoe-type) priors for high-dimensional regression models. The resulting posteriors, however, in general do not possess desirable frequentist properties, and the credible sets thus cannot serve as valid confidence sets even asymptotically. We introduce a novel debiasing approach that corrects the bias for the entire Bayesian posterior distribution. We establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem that guarantees the frequentist validity of the debiased posterior. We demonstrate the practical performance of our proposal through Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications in economics.</description>

      <title>Distributional Shrinkage II: Optimal Transport Denoisers with Higher-Order Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the signal denoising problem through the lens of optimal transport: the goal is to recover an unknown scalar signal distribution $X \sim P$ from noisy observations $Y = X + \sigma Z$, with $Z$ being standard Gaussian independent of $X$ and $\sigma&gt;0$ a known noise level. Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \ldots, T_\infty : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $\sigma^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \sharp Q, P)$. The limiting denoiser $T_\infty$ identifies the optimal transport map with $T_\infty \sharp Q = P$.
  We provide a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure underlying this hierarchy through Bell polynomial recursions, revealing how higher-order score functions encode the optimal transport map for signal denoising. We study two estimation strategies with convergence rates for higher-order scores from i.i.d. samples drawn from $Q$: (i) plug-in estimation via Gaussian kernel smoothing, and (ii) direct estimation via higher-order score matching. This hierarchy of agnostic denoisers opens new perspectives in signal denoising and empirical Bayes.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Functions on Dually Flat Spaces Using Geodesic Descent Based on Dual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose geodesic-based optimization methods on dually flat spaces, where the geometric structure of the parameter manifold is closely related to the form of the objective function. A primary application is maximum likelihood estimation in statistical models, especially exponential families, whose model manifolds are dually flat. We show that an m-geodesic update, which directly optimizes the log-likelihood, can theoretically reach the maximum likelihood estimator in a single step. In contrast, an e-geodesic update has a practical advantage in cases where the parameter space is geodesically complete, allowing optimization without explicitly handling parameter constraints. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and validate their effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Drawback of Enforcing Equivariance and its Compensation via the Lens of Expressive Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.</description>

      <title>New Approximation Results and Optimal Estimation for Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \citet{farrell2021deep} establish non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for general deep feedforward neural network (with rectified linear unit activation function) estimators, with \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} achieving a suboptimal convergence rate for fully connected feedforward networks. The authors suggest that improved approximation of fully connected networks could yield sharper versions of \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} without altering the theoretical framework. By deriving approximation bounds specifically for a narrower fully connected deep neural network, this note demonstrates that \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} can be improved to achieve an optimal rate (up to a logarithmic factor). Furthermore, this note briefly shows that deep neural network estimators can mitigate the curse of dimensionality for functions with compositional structure and functions defined on manifolds.</description>

      <title>Provably Learning from Modern Language Models via Low Logit Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern language models and their inner workings are incredibly complex, recent work (Golowich, Liu &amp; Shetty; 2025) has proposed a simple and potentially tractable abstraction for them through the observation that empirically, these language models all seem to have approximately low logit rank. Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.
  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in the Linear Valuation Model using Shape Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a shape-constrained approach to dynamic pricing for censored data in the linear valuation model eliminating the need for tuning parameters commonly required by existing methods. Previous works have addressed the challenge of unknown market noise distribution $F_0$ using strategies ranging from kernel methods to reinforcement learning algorithms, such as bandit techniques and upper confidence bounds (UCB), under the assumption that $F_0$ satisfies Lipschitz (or stronger) conditions. In contrast, our method relies on isotonic regression under the weaker assumption that $F_0$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$, for which we derive a regret upper bound. Simulations and experiments with real-world data obtained by Welltower Inc (a major healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust) consistently demonstrate that our method attains lower empirical regret in comparison to several existing methods in the literature while offering the advantage of being tuning-parameter free.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Analysis of Policy Evaluation for Robust Average Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first finite-sample analysis of policy evaluation in robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior work in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by showing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under a carefully constructed semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite expected sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18309v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive non-stationary implicit process prior that can capture complex transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Secant Alignment for Score-Based Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating density ratios has become increasingly important with the recent rise of score-based and diffusion-inspired methods. However, current tangent-based approaches rely on a high-variance learning objective, which leads to unstable training and costly numerical integration during inference. We propose \textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)}, a score-based framework along diffusion interpolants that replaces the instantaneous tangent with its interval integral, the secant, as the learning target. We show theoretically that the secant is a provably lower variance and smoother target for neural approximation, and also a strictly more general representation that contains the tangent as the infinitesimal limit. To make secant learning feasible, we introduce the \textit{Secant Alignment Identity (SAI)} to enforce self consistency between secant and tangent representations, and \textit{Contraction Interval Annealing (CIA)} to ensure stable convergence. Empirically, this stability-first formulation produces high efficiency and accuracy. ISA-DRE achieves comparable or superior results with fewer function evaluations, demonstrating robustness under large distribution discrepancies and effectively mitigating the density-chasm problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) for modeling dynamical systems from time-series data. The method uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded inputs, allowing the feature-space dimension to be chosen independently of the observation size and offering a flexible alternative to polynomial-based NGRC projections. We demonstrate the approach on benchmark tasks, including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation, using partial and noisy measurements. We further show that small amounts of measurement noise during training act as an effective regularizer, improving long-term autonomous stability compared to standard regression alone. Across all tests, the models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond the training data. The framework offers explicit control of system state during prediction, and these properties make NGRC a natural candidate for applications such as surrogate modeling and digital-twin applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Guarantees for Variational Inference in the Presence of Even and Elliptical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend several recent results providing symmetry-based guarantees for variational inference (VI) with location-scale families. VI approximates a target density $p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable distributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can recover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when $p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two important directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for $f$-divergences, a broad class that includes the reverse and forward Kullback-Leibler divergences and the $\alpha$-divergences. We highlight properties specific to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence under which we obtain our strongest guarantees. Second, we obtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and elliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates. These partial symmetries arise naturally in Bayesian hierarchical models, where the prior induces a challenging geometry but still possesses axes of symmetry. We illustrate these theoretical results in a number of experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has been widely used to optimize expensive and gradient-free objective functions across various domains. However, existing BO methods have not addressed the objective where both inputs and outputs are functions, which increasingly arise in complex systems as advanced sensing technologies. To fill this gap, we propose a novel function-on-function Bayesian optimization (FFBO) framework. Specifically, we first introduce a function-on-function Gaussian process (FFGP) model with a separable operator-valued kernel to capture the correlations between function-valued inputs and outputs. Compared to existing Gaussian process models, FFGP is modeled directly in the function space. Based on FFGP, we define a scalar upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function using a weighted operator-based scalarization strategy. Then, a scalable functional gradient ascent algorithm (FGA) is developed to efficiently identify the optimal function-valued input. We further analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of FFBO over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Localizing Anomalous Cliques in Inhomogeneous Networks using Egonets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.08925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cliques, or fully connected subgraphs, are among the most important and well-studied graph motifs in network science. We consider the problem of finding a statisti- cally anomalous clique hidden in a large network. There are two parts to this problem: (1) detection, i.e., determining whether an anomalous clique is present, and (2) localization, i.e., determining which vertices of the network constitute the detected clique. While this problem has been extensively studied under the homogeneous Erdos-Renyi model, little progress has been made beyond this simple setting, and no existing method can perform detection and localization in inhomogeneous networks within finite time. To address this gap, we first show that in homogeneous networks, the anomalousness of a clique depends solely on its size. This property does not carry over to inhomogeneous networks, where the identity of the vertices forming the clique plays a critical role, and a smaller clique can be more anomalous than a larger one. Building on this insight, we propose a unified method for clique detection and localization based on a class of subgraphs called egonets. The proposed method generalizes to a wide variety of inhomogeneous network models and is naturally amenable to parallel computing. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed method and demonstrate its empirical performance through simulation studies and application to two real world networks.</description>

Abstract: Correlation clustering is a flexible framework for partitioning data based solely on pairwise similarity or dissimilarity information, without requiring the number of clusters as input. However, in many practical scenarios, these pairwise similarities are not available a priori and must be obtained through costly measurements or human feedback. This motivates the use of active learning to query only the most informative pairwise comparisons, enabling effective clustering under budget constraints. In this work, we develop a principled active learning approach for correlation clustering by introducing several information-theoretic acquisition functions that prioritize queries based on entropy and expected information gain. These strategies aim to reduce uncertainty about the clustering structure as efficiently as possible. We evaluate our methods across a range of synthetic and real-world settings and show that they significantly outperform existing baselines in terms of clustering accuracy and query efficiency. Our results highlight the benefits of combining active learning with correlation clustering in settings where similarity information is costly or limited.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Diffusion Models with Application to Schedule Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating realistic new samples. Over the years, advanced architectures and sampling methods have been developed to make these models practically usable. However, certain synthesis process decisions still rely on heuristics without a solid theoretical foundation. In our work, we offer a novel analysis of the DM's inference process, introducing a comprehensive frequency response perspective. Specifically, by relying on Gaussianity assumption, we present the inference process as a closed-form spectral transfer function, capturing how the generated signal evolves in response to the initial noise. We demonstrate how the proposed analysis can be leveraged to design a noise schedule that aligns effectively with the characteristics of the data. The spectral perspective also provides insights into the underlying dynamics and sheds light on the relationship between spectral properties and noise schedule structure. Our results lead to scheduling curves that are dependent on the spectral content of the data, offering a theoretical justification for some of the heuristics taken by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Pretrained Transformers May Be Universally Robust In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we present the first theoretical analysis suggesting that adversarially pretrained transformers can serve as universally robust foundation models -- models that can robustly adapt to diverse downstream tasks with only lightweight tuning. Specifically, we demonstrate that single-layer linear transformers, after adversarial pretraining across a variety of classification tasks, can robustly generalize to unseen classification tasks through in-context learning from clean demonstrations (i.e., without requiring additional adversarial training or examples). This universal robustness stems from the model's ability to adaptively focus on robust features within given tasks. We also show the two open challenges for attaining robustness: accuracy--robustness trade-off and sample-hungry training. This study initiates the discussion on the utility of universally robust foundation models. While their training is expensive, the investment would prove worthwhile as downstream tasks can enjoy free adversarial robustness.

      <title>A Framework for Controllable Multi-objective Learning with Annealed Stein Variational Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient $Q$-Learning and Actor-Critic Methods for Robust Average Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under contamination, total-variation (TV) distance, and Wasserstein uncertainty sets. A key ingredient of our analysis is showing that the optimal robust $Q$ operator is a strict contraction with respect to a carefully designed semi-norm (with constant functions quotiented out). This property enables a stochastic approximation update that learns the optimal robust $Q$-function using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We also provide an efficient routine for robust $Q$-function estimation, which in turn facilitates robust critic estimation. Building on this, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that learns an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We provide numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Generic Machine Learning Framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting radio frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding unique characteristics that are featured in their received signal. These fingerprints are nuanced, but sufficiently detailed, motivating the pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The downstream task that requires the most meticulous RF fingerprinting (RFF) is known as specific emitter identification (SEI), which entails recognising each individual transmitter. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous defence and civilian applications such as signal intelligence, electronic surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless devices, to name a few. In recent years, data-driven RFF approaches have become popular due to their ability to automatically learn intricate fingerprints. They generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional RFF techniques that are often labour-intensive, inflexible, and only applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. In this paper, we present a generic and versatile machine learning (ML) framework for data-driven RFF with several popular downstream tasks such as SEI, data association (EDA) and RF emitter clustering (RFEC). It is emitter-type agnostic. We then demonstrate the introduced framework for several tasks using real RF datasets for spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and countering drones applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rectified flow (Liu et al., 2022; Liu, 2022; Wu et al., 2023) is a method for defining a transport map between two distributions, and enjoys popularity in machine learning, although theoretical results supporting the validity of these methods are scant. The rectified flow can be regarded as an approximation to optimal transport, but in contrast to other transport methods that require optimization over a function space, computing the rectified flow only requires standard statistical tools such as regression or density estimation, which we leverage to develop empirical versions of transport maps. We study some structural properties of the rectified flow, including existence, uniqueness, and regularity, as well as the related statistical properties, such as rates of convergence and central limit theorems, for some selected estimators. To do so, we analyze the bounded and unbounded cases separately as each presents unique challenges. In both cases, we are able to establish convergence at faster rates than those for the usual nonparametric regression and density estimation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Concentration at the Edge of Stability: Information Geometry of Kernel Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Bernoulli-Based Sampling Method for Multi-Label Data with Application to Meta-Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.</description>

      <title>DS FedProxGrad: Asymptotic Stationarity Without Noise Floor in Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work \cite{arifgroup} introduced Federated Proximal Gradient \textbf{(\texttt{FedProxGrad})} for solving non-convex composite optimization problems in group fair federated learning. However, the original analysis established convergence only to a \textit{noise-dominated neighborhood of stationarity}, with explicit dependence on a variance-induced noise floor. In this work, we provide an improved asymptotic convergence analysis for a generalized \texttt{FedProxGrad}-type analytical framework with inexact local proximal solutions and explicit fairness regularization. We call this extended analytical framework \textbf{DS \texttt{FedProxGrad}} (Decay Step Size \texttt{FedProxGrad}). Under a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule \cite{robbins1951stochastic} and a mild decay condition on local inexactness, we prove that $\liminf_{r\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}^r)\|^2] = 0$, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically stationary and the convergence rate does not depend on a variance-induced noise floor.</description>
