      <title>Quasi-Isometric Reductions Between Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the recursion-theoretic aspects of large-scale geometries of infinite strings, a subject initiated by Khoussainov and Takisaka (2017). We investigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive infinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such reductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically reducible to $\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers an open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.</description>

      <title>Dual Adjunction Between $\Omega$-Automata and Wilke Algebra Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Omega$-automata and Wilke algebras are formalisms for characterising $\omega$-regular languages via their ultimately periodic words. $\Omega$-automata read finite representations of ultimately periodic words, called lassos, and they are a subclass of lasso automata. We introduce lasso semigroups as a generalisation of Wilke algebras that mirrors how lasso automata generalise $\Omega$-automata, and we show that finite lasso semigroups characterise regular lasso languages. We then show a dual adjunction between lasso automata and quotients of the free lasso semigroup with a recognising set, and as our main result we show that this dual adjunction restricts to one between $\Omega$-automata and quotients of the free Wilke algebra with a recognising set.</description>

      <title>Computing Inductive Invariants of Regular Abstraction Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular transition systems (RTS) are a popular formalism for modeling infinite-state systems in general, and parameterised systems in particular. In a CONCUR 22 paper, Esparza et al. introduce a novel approach to the verification of RTS, based on inductive invariants. The approach computes the intersection of all inductive invariants of a given RTS that can be expressed as CNF formulas with a bounded number of clauses, and uses it to construct an automaton recognising an overapproximation of the reachable configurations. The paper shows that the problem of deciding if the language of this automaton intersects a given regular set of unsafe configurations is in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ and $\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard.
  We introduce $\textit{regular abstraction frameworks}$, a generalisation of the approach of Esparza et al., very similar to the regular abstractions of Hong and Lin. A framework consists of a regular language of $\textit{constraints}$, and a transducer, called the $\textit{interpretation}$, that assigns to each constraint the set of configurations of the RTS satisfying it. Examples of regular abstraction frameworks include the formulas of Esparza et al., octagons, bounded difference matrices, and views. We show that the generalisation of the decision problem above to regular abstraction frameworks remains in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$, and prove a matching (non-trivial) $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness bound.
  $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$-hardness implies that, in the worst case, the automaton recognising the overapproximation of the reachable configurations has a double-exponential number of states. We introduce a learning algorithm that computes this automaton in a lazy manner, stopping whenever the current hypothesis is already strong enough to prove safety. We report on an implementation and show that our experimental results improve on those of Esparza et al.</description>

      <title>Bisimulations and Logics for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) are models of non-interleaving concurrency for analyzing concurrent systems. There is a rich literature that deals with bisimulations for concurrent systems, and some of them have been extended to HDAs. However, no logical characterizations of these relations are currently available for HDAs.
  In this work, we address this gap by introducing Ipomset modal logic, a Hennessy-Milner type logic over HDAs, and show that it characterizes Path-bisimulation, a variant of the standard ST-bisimulation. We also define a notion of Cell-bisimulation, using the open-maps framework of Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel, and establish the relationship between these bisimulations (and also their "strong" variants, which take restrictions into account). In our work, we rely on the new categorical definition of HDAs as presheaves over concurrency lists and on track objects.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we introduce the reflection complexity function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove general results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove a Morse-Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of quasi-Sturmian, episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and complementation-symmetric Rote, and rich sequences. Furthermore, we prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software $\mathtt{Walnut}$ to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue-Morse sequence. We note that there are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>
