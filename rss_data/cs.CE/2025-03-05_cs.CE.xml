      <title>Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD): a scalable and interpretable approach for large-scale physics-based problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively employed as a powerful function approximator for modeling physics-based problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their popularity, standard deep learning models often demand prohibitively large computational resources and yield limited accuracy when scaling to large-scale, high-dimensional physical problems. Their black-box nature further hinders the application in industrial problems where interpretability and high precision are critical. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD), a scalable and interpretable framework that has the merits of both machine learning and finite element methods for modeling large-scale physical systems. By integrating locally supported interpolation functions from finite element into the network architecture, INN-TD achieves a sparse learning structure with enhanced accuracy, faster training/solving speed, and reduced memory footprint. This makes it particularly effective for tackling large-scale high-dimensional parametric PDEs in training, solving, and inverse optimization tasks in physical problems where high precision is required.</description>

      <title>An accurate and robust level-set formulation for multiple junction kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The front-capturing Level-Set (LS) method is widely employed in academia and industry to model grain boundary (GB) migration during the microstructure evolution of polycrystalline materials under thermo-mechanical treatments. During capillarity-driven grain growth, the conventional mean curvature flow equation, $\vec{v} = - \mu \gamma \kappa \vec{n}$, is used to compute the GB normal migration velocity. Over recent decades, extensive efforts have been made to incorporate polycrystalline heterogeneity into this framework. However, despite increased complexity and computational costs, these approaches have yet to achieve fully satisfactory performance. This paper introduces a simple yet robust LS formulation that accurately captures multiple junction kinetics, even with extreme GB energy ratios. Validation against existing analytical solutions highlights the method's accuracy and efficiency. This novel approach offers significant potential for advancing the study of highly heterogeneous interface systems.</description>

      <title>Smart Reaction Templating: A Graph-Based Method for Automated Molecular Dynamics Input Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling chemical reactions in molecular dynamics simulations requires detailed pre- and post-reaction templates, often created through labor-intensive manual workflows. This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Microweather Wind Velocities for Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pursuit of safe, reliable, and weather-tolerant urban air mobility (UAM) solutions, this work proposes a generative modeling approach for characterizing microweather wind velocities. Microweather, or the weather conditions in highly localized areas, is particularly complex in urban environments owing to the chaotic and turbulent nature of wind flows. Furthermore, traditional means of assessing local wind fields are not generally viable solutions for UAM applications: 1) field measurements that would rely on permanent wind profiling systems in operational air space are not practical, 2) physics-based models that simulate fluid dynamics at a sufficiently high resolution are not computationally tractable, and 3) data-driven modeling approaches that are largely deterministic ignore the inherent variability in turbulent flows that dictates UAM reliability. Thus, advancements in predictive capabilities are needed to help mitigate the unique operational safety risks that microweather winds pose for smaller, lighter weight UAM aircraft.
  This work aims to model microweather wind velocities in a manner that is computationally-efficient, captures random variability, and would only require a temporary, rather than permanent, field measurement campaign. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in conditional generative AI such as text-to-image generation, the proposed approach learns a probabilistic macro-to-microweather mapping between regional weather forecasts and measured local wind velocities using generative modeling (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, flow matching, and Gaussian mixture models). A simple proof of concept was implemented using a dataset comprised of local (micro) measurements from a Sonic Detection and Ranging (SoDAR) wind profiler along with (macro) forecast data from a nearby weather station over the same time period.</description>

      <title>FinArena: A Human-Agent Collaboration Framework for Financial Market Analysis and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve stock trend predictions and support personalized investment decisions, this paper proposes FinArena, a novel Human-Agent collaboration framework. Inspired by the mixture of experts (MoE) approach, FinArena combines multimodal financial data analysis with user interaction. The human module features an interactive interface that captures individual risk preferences, allowing personalized investment strategies. The machine module utilizes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent system to integrate diverse data sources, such as stock prices, news articles, and financial statements. To address hallucinations in LLMs, FinArena employs the adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generative (RAG) method for processing unstructured news data. Finally, a universal expert agent makes investment decisions based on the features extracted from multimodal data and investors' individual risk preferences. Extensive experiments show that FinArena surpasses both traditional and state-of-the-art benchmarks in stock trend prediction and yields promising results in trading simulations across various risk profiles. These findings highlight FinArena's potential to enhance investment outcomes by aligning strategic insights with personalized risk considerations.</description>

      <title>Applying Computational Engineering Modelling to Analyse the Social Impact of Conflict and Violent Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents a novel framework for analysing the societal impacts of armed conflict by applying principles from engineering and material science. Building on the idea of a "social fabric", it recasts communities as plates with properties, such as resilience and vulnerability, analogous to material parameters like thickness or elasticity. Conflict events are treated as external forces that deform this fabric, revealing how repeated shocks and local weaknesses can compound over time. Using a custom Python-based Finite Element Analysis implementation, the thesis demonstrates how data on socioeconomic indicators (e.g., infrastructure, health, and demographics) and conflict incidents can be translated into a single computational model. Preliminary tests validate that results align with expected physical behaviours, and a proof-of-concept highlights how this approach can capture indirect or spillover effects and illuminate the areas most at risk of long-term harm. By bridging social science insights with computational modelling, this work offers an adaptable frame to inform both academic research and on-the-ground policy decisions for communities affected by violence.</description>

      <title>RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7 to 89.1 on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient computation of sensitivities is a promising approach for efficiently of designing and optimizing high voltage direct current cable joints. This paper presents the adjoint variable method for coupled nonlinear transient electrothermal problems as an efficient approach to compute sensitivities with respect to a large number of design parameters. The method is used to compute material sensitivities of a 320kV high voltage direct current cable joint specimen. The results are validated against sensitivities obtained via the direct sensitivity method.</description>

      <title>Towards personalised assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm structural integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition involving the permanent dilation of the aorta, often detected incidentally through imaging for some other condition. The standard clinical approach to managing AAA follows a one-size-fits-all model based on aneurysm size and growth rate, leading to underestimation or overestimation of rupture risk in individual patients. The widely studied stress-based rupture risk estimation using computational biomechanics requires wall strength information. However, non-invasive methods for local patient-specific wall strength measurement have not yet been developed. Recently, we introduced an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images to measure wall strain throughout the cardiac cycle. In the present study, we integrated wall tension computation and strain measurement to develop a novel measure of local structural integrity of AAA wall - Relative Structural Integrity Index (RSII), independent of material properties and thickness of the wall and conditions of blood pressure measurement. Our methods provide a visual map of AAA wall structural integrity for individual patients using only their medical images and blood pressure data. We applied our methods to twelve patients. Additionally, we compared our measure of structural integrity of aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal aortas. Our results show similar values of the wall structural integrity measure across the patients, indicating the reliability of our methods. In line with experimental observations reported in the literature, our analysis revealed that localized low stiffness areas are primarily found in the most dilated AAA regions. Our results clearly demonstrate that the AAA wall is stiffer than the non-aneurysmal aorta.</description>

      <title>SocialEyes: Scaling mobile eye-tracking to multi-person social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Challenges in real-world, multi-person environments have, however, restrained eye-tracking research predominantly to single-person, in-lab settings. We developed a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data from multiple mobile eye-tracking devices during collective viewing experiences (e.g., concerts, films, lectures). We implemented lightweight operator interfaces for real-time-monitoring, remote-troubleshooting, and gaze-projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. We tested the system in a live concert and a film screening with 30 simultaneous viewers during each of two public events (N=60). We observe precise time-synchronisation between devices measured through recorded clock-offsets, and accurate gaze-projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Our novel analysis metrics and visualizations illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data for understanding collaborative behaviour and social interaction. This advancement promotes ecological validity in eye-tracking research and paves the way for innovative interactive tools.</description>

      <title>PatternPaint: Practical Layout Pattern Generation Using Diffusion-Based Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating diverse VLSI layout patterns is essential for various downstream tasks in design for manufacturing, as design rules continually evolve during the development of new technology nodes. However, existing training-based methods for layout pattern generation rely on large datasets. In practical scenarios, especially when developing a new technology node, obtaining such extensive layout data is challenging. Consequently, training models with large datasets becomes impractical, limiting the scalability and adaptability of prior approaches. To this end, we propose PatternPaint, a diffusion-based framework capable of generating legal patterns with limited design-rule-compliant training samples. PatternPaint simplifies complex layout pattern generation into a series of inpainting processes with a template-based denoising scheme. Furthermore, we perform few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results show that using a sub-3nm technology node (Intel 18A), our model is the only one that can generate legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings among all previous works and achieves a high diversity score. Additionally, our few-shot finetuning can boost the legality rate with 1.87X improvement compared to the original pretrained model. As a result, we demonstrate a production-ready approach for layout pattern generation in developing new technology nodes.</description>
