      <title>Tracing the Galactic Origins of Selected Four G-type Stars in the Solar Neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-method investigation of four metal-poor G-type main-sequence stars to resolve their Galactic origins. By combining high-resolution spectroscopy from PolarBase, photometric/astrometric data from Gaia DR3, and spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, we derive precise stellar parameters, chemical abundances, kinematics and Galactic orbital parameters. The stars HD 22879, HD 144579, HD 188510, and HD 201891 show effective temperatures of 5855 +/- 110, 5300 +/- 160, 5370 +/- 60, and 5880 +/- 90 K; surface gravities of 4.40 +/- 0.18, 4.52 +/- 0.37, 4.57 +/- 0.13, and 4.48 +/- 0.18 (in cgs units); and metallicities of -0.86 +/- 0.08, -0.55 +/- 0.12, -1.60 +/- 0.07, and -1.15 +/- 0.07 dex, respectively. Kinematic analysis suggests that HD 22879, HD 144579, and HD 201891 are potential bulge-origin escapees, possibly ejected by the Galactic bar or spiral arm perturbations. HD 188510, however, shows halo-like dynamics, including a retrograde orbit. Chemical abundance trends ([alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]) reveal mixed origins, challenging kinematic classifications. This discrepancy highlights the importance of integrative methodologies in Galactic archaeology. We associate HD 22879, HD 144579, and HD 201891 with the bulge globular clusters NGC 6441, NGC 5927, and NGC 6544, respectively. HD 188510's retrograde motion and low metallicity align with ejection from the halo globular cluster NGC 5139 (omega Centauri). These results illustrate the complex interplay of dynamical processes -- including bar resonances, spiral arm perturbations, and tidal stripping -- in depositing metal-poor stars into the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Advancing accuracy in age determinations of old-disk stars using an oscillating red giant in an eclipsing binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of resonant oscillation modes in low-mass red giant branch stars enables their ages to be inferred with exceptional ($\sim$10%) precision, unlocking the possibility to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the Milky Way at early cosmic times. Ensuring the accuracy of such a precise age scale is a fundamental yet difficult challenge. Since the age of red giant branch stars primarily hinges on their mass, an independent mass determination for an oscillating red giant star provides the means for such assessment. We analyze the old eclipsing binary KIC10001167, which hosts an oscillating red giant branch star and is a member of the thick disk of the Milky Way. Of the known red giants in eclipsing binaries, this is the only member of the thick disk that has asteroseismic signal of high enough quality to test the seismic mass inference at the 2% level. We measure the binary orbit and obtain fundamental stellar parameters through combined analysis of light curve eclipses and radial velocities, and perform a detailed asteroseismic, photospheric, and Galactic kinematic characterization of the red giant and binary system. We show that the dynamically determined mass $0.9337\pm0.0077 \rm\ M_{\odot}$ (0.8%) of this 10 Gyr-old star agrees within 1.4% with the mass inferred from detailed modelling of individual pulsation mode frequencies (1.6%). This is now the only thick disk stellar system, hosting a red giant, where the mass has been determined both asteroseismically with better than 2% precision, and through a model-independent method at 1% precision, and we hereby affirm the potential of asteroseismology to define an accurate age scale for ancient stars to trace the Milky Way assembly history.</description>

      <title>Which is the most eccentric binary known? Insights from the 2023/4 pericenter passages of Zeta Bo\"otis and Eta Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a clear dearth of very eccentric binaries among those for which individual eccentricities can be measured. In this paper we report on observations of the two nearby, bright and very eccentric visual binaries Zeta Bo\"otis ($\zeta$ Boo) and Eta Ophiuchi ($\eta$ Oph), for which VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric observations were obtained during their pericenter passages in 2023/4. Previous observations of $\zeta$ Boo suggest an eccentricity $e&gt;0.99$ with high significance, implying that it has the highest eccentricity of any known binary. However, our interferometric measurements near periastron passage reveal that the eccentricity is actually $e=0.980450\pm0.000064$ (second highest well constrained eccentricity) with a pericenter distance $a_p=0.818\pm0.009\text{ au}$. We attribute the previous over-estimation to a degeneracy that plagues very eccentric visual binary orbital solutions. For $\eta$ Oph we find an eccentricity $e=0.93077\pm0.00013$ (compared to previous estimates of $e=0.95\pm 0.02$), a pericenter distance $a_p=2.15\pm0.10 \text{ au}$ and attribute the over-estimated dynamical mass in the previous solution to an underestimated error in the semi-major axis. In both systems full circularization is expected as the stars evolve and expand, ultimately leading to close binaries with no memory of their very eccentric past.</description>

      <title>Delayed and Displaced: The Impact of Binary Interactions on Core-collapse SN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova feedback models in hydrodynamical simulations typically assume that all stars evolve as single stars. However, the majority of massive stars are formed in binaries and multiple systems, where interactions with a companion can affect stars' subsequent evolution and kinematics. We assess the impact of binary interactions on the timing and spatial distribution of core-collapse supernovae, using `cogsworth` simulations to evolve binary star populations, and their subsequent galactic orbits, within state-of-the-art hydrodynamical zoom-in galaxy simulations. We show that binary interactions: (a) displace supernovae, with ~13% of all supernovae occurring more than 0.1 kpc from their parent cluster; and (b) produce delayed supernovae, such that ~25% of all supernovae occur after the final supernova from a single star population. Delays are largest for low-mass merger products, which can explode more than 200 Myr after a star formation event. We characterize our results as a function of: (1) initial binary population distributions, (2) binary physics parameters and evolutionary pathways, (3) birth cluster dissolution assumptions, and (4) galaxy models (which vary metallicity, star formation history, gravitational potential and simulation codes), and show that the overall timing and spatial distributions of supernovae are surprisingly insensitive to most of these variations. We provide metallicity-dependent analytic fits that can be substituted for single-star subgrid feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, and discuss some of the possible implications for binary-driven feedback in galaxies, which may become particularly important at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning between thermal and non-thermal electrons and ions in magnetotail reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>

      <title>Formation of chromospheric fan-shaped jets through magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets highlight the highly dynamic nature of the solar atmosphere. They have been named as ''light walls'' or ''peacock jets'' in high-resolution observations. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanisms responsible for the generation of recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets utilizing data from the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, along with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). These jets appear as dark elongated structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, persist for over an hour, and are located in the intergranular lanes between a pair of same-polarity sunspots. Our analysis reveals that magnetic flux cancellation at the jet base plays a crucial role in their formation. HMI line-of-sight magnetograms show a gradual decrease in opposite-polarity fluxes spanning the sequence of jets in H$\alpha$ - 0.8 angstrom images, suggesting that recurrent magnetic reconnection, likely driven by recurrent miniature flux-rope eruptions that are built up and triggered by flux cancellation, powers these jets. Additionally, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a 3D magnetic null-point topology at the jet formation site $\sim$1.25 Mm height. Furthermore, we observed strong brightening in AIA 304 angstrom channel above the neutral line. Based on our observations and extrapolation results, we propose that these recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets align with the minifilament eruption model previously proposed for coronal jets. Though our study focuses on fan-shaped jets in between same-polarity sunspots, similar mechanism might be responsible for light bridge-associated fan-shaped jets.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of a ring structure in the disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) with ALMA Band 7 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young stellar objects (YSOs) are surrounded by protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplace of young planets. Ring and gap structures are observed among evolved protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as a consequence of planet formation. The pre-Main Sequence (pre-MS) star MP Mus hosts one of the few known examples of protoplanetary disks within ~100 pc. Previously, a disk ring structure, with a radius of 80-85 au, was detected in scattered light via near-infrared coronographic/polarimetric imaging. This ring structure may be indicative of the disk clearing process. Although such ring structures were not seen in the ALMA Band 6 images, some features were detected at $\sim$50 au. In this paper, we analyzed new ALMA Band 7 observations of MP Mus in order to investigate the details of its disk substructures. By subtracting the continuum profile generated from Band 7 data, we discovered a ring structure in the Band 7 dust continuum image at $\sim$50 au. We calculated the overall dust mass as $28.4\pm2.8 M_{\oplus}$ at 0.89 mm and $26.3\pm2.6 M_{\oplus}$ at 1.3 mm and the millimeter spectral index $\alpha_{0.89-1.3mm} \sim 2.2 \pm 0.3$ between 0.89 mm and 1.3 mm. Moreover, we display the spatial distribution of the spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$), estimating values ranging from 1.3 at the inner disk to 4.0 at a large radius. Additionally, we observed an extended gas disk up to $\sim$120 au, in contrast with a compact continuum millimeter extent of $\sim$60 au. We conclude that there are strong indicators for an active radial drift process within the disk. However, we cannot discard the possibility of a dust evolution process and a grain growth process as responsible for the outer disk structures observed in the ALMA continuum imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigating open cluster King 6: Detection of three new variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents photometric analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster King 6, utilizing photometric data in UBV(RI)$_c$ passband and data from the 2MASS mission. The Gaia DR3 kinematic data were used to estimate the membership probabilities and TESS data is employed to search for variable stars within the cluster. The cluster's radius is estimated to be 9$^\prime$.0 based on the stellar density profile, while optical and near-infrared color-color diagrams} revealed color excesses of E(B-V) = 0.58$ \pm$ 0.03, E(J-K) = 0.24 $\pm$ 0.03, and E(V-K) = 1.53 $\pm$ 0.01 mag. Interstellar extinction law is normal in the direction of the cluster. The cluster$^\prime$s estimated age is $\sim$251 Myr and distance is 724 $\pm$ 5 pc. The mass function slope was found to be x = 0.57 $\pm$ 0.28 by considering stars $\geq$ 1 M$_\odot$. Our analysis indicates that the cluster is dynamically relaxed. Furthermore, we identified three new variable stars for the first time in the cluster region using TESS data. These variables belong to the category of slow pulsating B-type variables, with periods of 46.70, 47.92, and 37.56 hours.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Heavy Ion Abundances with Solar Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When observed at 1 AU, slow solar wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions with magnetic topologies that are intermittently open to the heliosphere. Fast wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere eg coronal holes. The evolution of the solar wind helium abundance (AHe) with solar activity is likely driven by the evolution of different solar wind source regions. Separating the solar wind into fast and slow for each element based on its characteristic speed derived in Alterman et al. (2025) we quantify the evolution of helium and heavy element abundances $(X/H):(X/H)_\mathrm{photo}$ with solar activity. We show that AHe strongly correlates with sunspot number; in slow and fast wind the average non-transient solar wind AHe is limited to 51% of its photospheric value; slow wind heavy element abundances evolve significantly with solar activity; fast wind heavy element abundances do not; the correlation coefficient with sunspot number of elemental abundances for species heavier than He monotonically increases with increasing mass; and the correlation coefficients between the in situ observations and the normalized sunspot number are stronger than those using the unnormalized sunspot number. We infer that the sunspot number is a clock timing the solar cycle but not the driver of the physical process underlying the evolution of these abundances with solar activity; this underlying process is likely related to the energy available to accelerate the solar plasma from the chromosphere and transition region or low corona into the solar wind; and differences between the evolution of slow and fast solar wind abundances are similarly related to the energy available to accelerate the elements at these heights above the Suns surface.</description>

      <title>Transverse Oscillations of Coronal Loops Induced by a Jet-Related Confined Flare on 11 July 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report the multiwavelength and multiview observations of transverse oscillations of two loop strands induced by a jet-related, confined flare in active region NOAA 13056 on 11 July 2022. The jet originates close to the right footpoint of the loops and propagates in the northeast direction. The average rise time and fall time of the jet are $\approx$ 11 and $\approx$ 13.5 minutes, so that the lifetime of the jet reaches $\approx$ 24.5 minutes. The rising motion of the jet is divided into two phases with average velocities of $\approx$ 164 and $\approx$ 546\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The falling motion of the jet is coherent with an average velocity of $\approx$ 124\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The transverse oscillations of the loops, lasting for 3 $-$ 5 cycles, are of fundamental standing kink mode. The maximal initial amplitudes of the two strands are $\approx$ 5.8 and $\approx$ 4.9 Mm. The average periods are $\approx$ 405\,s and $\approx$ 407\,s. Both of the strands experience slow expansions during oscillations. The lower limits of the kink speed are 895$_{-17}^{+21}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_1 and 891$_{-35}^{+29}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_2, respectively. The corresponding lower limits of the Alfv\'{e}n speed are estimated to be 664$_{-13}^{+16}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and 661$_{-26}^{+22}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A post-common-envelope binary with double-peaked Balmer emission lines from TMTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical method provides an efficient way to discover post-common-envelope binaries (PCEB) with faint white dwarfs (WDs), thanks to the development of time-domain survey projects. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the PCEB system TMTS J15530469+4457458 (J1553), discovered by the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey, to explore its physical origin and evolutionary fate. This system is characterized by double-peaked Balmer emission lines, and a cross-correlation function is applied to derive its radial velocity (RV) from a series of phase-resolved Keck spectra. Analyses with the cross-correlation function suggest that this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary and only one star is optically visible. Further analysis through Doppler tomography indicates that J1553 is a detached binary without an accretion disk. Under such a configuration, the simultaneous light-curve and RV fitting reveal that this system contains an unseen WD with mass $M_{\rm A}=0.56\pm 0.09\, M_{\odot}$, and an M4 dwarf with mass $M_{\rm B}=0.37\pm 0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_{\rm B}=0.403^{+0.014}_{-0.015}\,R_{\odot}$. The extra prominent Balmer emission lines seen in the spectra can trace the motion of the WD, which are likely formed near the WD surface as a result of wind accretion. According to the MESA simulation, J1553 could have evolved from a binary consisting of a 2.0-4.0 ${M}_{\odot}$ zero-age-main-sequence star and an M dwarf with an initial orbital period $P_i\approx 201-476$ d, and the system has undergone a common-envelope (CE) phase. After about $3.3\times10^6$ yr, J1553 should evolve into a cataclysmic variable, with a transient state as a supersoft X-ray source at the beginning. J1553 is an excellent system for studying wind accretion, CE ejection physics, and binary evolution theory.</description>

      <title>SOLIS. XIX. The chemically rich SVS13-B protostellar jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the IRAM NOEMA Large Program SOLIS, we imaged the protostellar sources SVS13-A and SVS13-B in SiO, SO, CS, and CH3OH at a spatial resolution of 2"-3" (600-900 au). The CS and SO emission traces the 5000 au envelope that hosts the SVS13-A and VLA3 young stellar objects, and CH3OH probes the compact hot corino associated with SVS13-A. In addition, CS blue-shifted emission reveals a molecular shell in the direction of the jet driven by SVS13-A that is revealed by high-velocity SiO, SO and low-velocity H_2 emission. We also imaged the protostellar jet driven by SVS13-B in SiO, and in SO, CS, and CH3OH for the first time as well. The molecules peak at different distances from the driving source: SiO(2-1) peaks at about 1600 au, and SO(2_3-1_2), CS(2--1) and CH3OH(2_k,k-1_k,k) peak at about 2000-2850 au. Moreover, SiO(2-1) emits at larger distances than SiO(5--4), indicating a lower excitation at a larger distance from the protostar.
  The multi-species observations revealed a stratified chemical structure in the jet of SVS13-B. A jet-like component with a transversal size &lt; 450 au is traced by SiO, which is efficiently formed in high-velocity shocks (&gt; 25 km/s) by sputtering and vaporisation of the grain cores and mantles. A slower and wider (transversal size of about 750 au) component is probed by methanol, which is released from dust mantles at lower shock velocities (&lt; 10 km/s). The SO and CS emission traces an intermediate component with respect to the components probed by SiO and CH3OH. High spatial resolution imaging (down to 10 au) of the jet of SVS13-B in multiple species will aid in reconstructing the chemistry of shocked material in protostellar jets.</description>

      <title>The growth of a lithium abundance dispersion in pre main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium is predicted, and observed, to be depleted in contracting, low-mass pre main sequence (PMS) stars. Yet these stars reach the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) with a spread in lithium abundance at a given effective temperature that is not predicted by standard stellar evolutionary models and which appears to be correlated with rotation. Using a homogeneous dataset provided by the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, we have followed the evolving photospheric lithium content of cohorts of stars destined to be ZAMS late G-, K- and M-dwarfs, in clusters at ages of 2-300 Myr. We show that a dispersion in the LiI 6708A line strength develops in the lower mass stars after 10-20 Myr on the PMS, as soon as Li depletion begins, even in fully convective stars. A model based on a surface starspot coverage varying from star-to-star, leading to a differential Li-burning rate, can explain this temporal behaviour and its mass dependence. However, to fully explain the magnitude of the Li dispersion and its correlation with rotation, the spot coverage during Li-burning would need to be a factor of two larger on average than measured in ZAMS clusters like the Pleiades and continue increasing with rotation in PMS stars beyond the usual "saturation limit" observed for other magnetic activity indicators.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Spacecraft Analysis of Type III Radio Burst Electron Beam Deceleration and electron deceleration model in the inhomegeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Impact of Alfv\'en Wave Forcing in Interplanetary Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology.
  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Identify Spectral Energy Distribution Outliers: Application to the S-PLUS DR4 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of specific stellar populations using photometry for spectroscopic follow-up is a first step to confirm and better understand their nature. In this context, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify candidates for spectroscopic follow-up using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). First, using an anomaly detection technique based on an autoencoder model, we select a large sample of objects ($\sim 19,000$) whose Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is not well reconstructed by the model after training it on a well-behaved star sample. Then, we apply the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to the 66 color measurements from S-PLUS, complemented by information from the SIMBAD database, to identify stellar populations. Our analysis reveals 69 carbon-rich star candidates that, based on their spatial and kinematic characteristics, may belong to the CH or Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) categories. Among these chemically peculiar candidates, we identify four as likely carbon dwarf stars. We show that it is feasible to identify three primary white dwarf (WD) populations: WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (DA), WDs with neutral helium-dominated atmospheres (DB), and the WDs main sequence binaries (WD + MS). Furthermore, by using eROSITA X-ray data, we also highlight the identification of candidates for very active low-mass stars. Finally, we identified a large number of binary systems using the autoencoder model, but did not observe a clear association between the overdensities in the t-SNE map and their orbital properties.</description>

      <title>First detections of PN, PO and PO+ toward a shocked low-mass starless core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M &lt; $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Four Elements to Rule Them All: Abundances are Rigidly Coupled in the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical tagging is a central pursuit of galactic archaeology, but requires sufficiently discriminative abundances to uniquely identify sites of star formation. This task is complicated by intrinsic scatter among conatal stars, inter-element correlations, imprecise abundance measurements, and systematics across stellar evolutionary states. In this work, we formalize the abundance correlation structure of the disk by quantifying the amplitude of information in individual element abundances once a subset is known, and map inter-element residual correlations to uncover hidden signatures of nucleosynthesis. We use two datasets of 79 (593) stars across $-0.15&lt;\rm [Fe/H]&lt;0.13$ ($-1&lt;\rm [Fe/H]&lt;0.41$) with measurements of 30 (19) element abundances of solar neighborhood stars, including 11 (7) light and $\alpha$, 7 (3) Fe-peak, and 12 (9) neutron capture elements. With a simple linear regression model, we predict most $\alpha$ and Fe-peak element abundances within 0.03~dex ($\sim7\%$), and neutron capture elements within 0.05~dex ($\sim10\%$). Including first and second peak s-process elements as predictors improves most neutron capture element predictions to within 0.02~dex (5\%), although no predictive power is gained by including an r-process element. We uncover strong (anti-)correlations in small residual abundances between and within element families. Our finding that disk abundance space is rigidly coupled, from light to heavy elements, implies chemical tagging is infeasible at $&gt;2\%$ precision for $\sim$30 elements. However, the residual structure encodes fingerprints of star formation history, inherited from nucleosynthesis and environmental variations, and provides critical constraints for chemical evolution models. Future disk surveys must achieve sub-2-5\% precision in 30+ elements to access this independent information.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximations to the Focused Transport Equation of Energetic Particles, I. The Standard Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.</description>

      <title>The impact of new ($\alpha$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is weaker. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates increase the ws-process mainly in all the stages, while the new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates only increase the ws-process in C and Ne burning stages. Updating these new reaction rates would increase the production of ws-process isotopes by tens of times. We also note that for more massive stars, the enhancement by new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates become more significant.</description>

      <title>Introducing STARDIS: An Open and Modular Stellar Spectral Synthesis Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called stardis. stardis is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of spectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure, inputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of stardis as well as the radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show spectral comparisons between stardis and korg with the same input atmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to phoenix for solar models. We find that stardis generally agrees well with korg for solar models on the few percent level or better, that the codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in cooler stars. stardis can be found at https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis, and documentation can be found at https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated dataset that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine-invariant (e.g. \texttt{emcee}) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, it has been highlighted that there are discrepancies between different orbital fitting solutions. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 62364, HD 38529, 14 Her, eps Ind A, HD 211847, HD 111031, and GJ 680, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on the comparison between our direct modeling of the astrometric catalog data and the orvara code, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfo: a partially stripped SN II from a yellow supergiant</title>

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN) 2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a few hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs of the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed in the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days, while no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with normal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the broad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the explosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\pm0.1$ mag, making it a faint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad P-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 km/s. One month after the explosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though the H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN 2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN 2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From its spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a yellow supergiant, having an initial mass of 15 $M_{\odot}$. This detection supports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter than SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb class, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded progenitors than luminous SNe IIb.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>
