      <title>Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of robust cell differentiation under epigenetic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding to final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation processes exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the cells towards varying final cell states that increase the stability. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a differentiation process that uses a directed shifting of fixed points, visualized through the dimensional reduction of gene-expression states. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed.</description>
