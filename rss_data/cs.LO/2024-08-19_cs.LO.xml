      <title>Computational Complexity of Standpoint LTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standpoint linear temporal logic SLTL is a recent formalism able to model possibly conflicting commitments made by distinct agents, taking into account aspects of temporal reasoning. In this paper, we analyse the computational properties of SLTL. First, we establish logarithmic-space reductions between the satisfiability problems for the multi-dimensional modal logic PTLxS5 and SLTL. This leads to the EXPSPACE-completeness of the satisfiability problem in SLTL, which is a surprising result in view of previous investigations. Next, we present a method of restricting SLTL so that the obtained fragment is a strict extension of both the (non-temporal) standpoint logic and linear-time temporal logic LTL, but the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete in this fragment. Thus, we show how to combine standpoint logic with LTL so that the worst-case complexity of the obtained combination is not higher than of pure LTL.</description>

      <title>A Unified Automata-Theoretic Approach to LTLf Modulo Theories (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel automata-based approach to address linear temporal logic modulo theory (LTL-MT) as a specification language for data words. LTL-MT extends LTL_f by replacing atomic propositions with quantifier-free multi-sorted first-order formulas interpreted over arbitrary theories. While standard LTL_f is reduced to finite automata, we reduce LTL-MT to symbolic data-word automata (SDWAs), whose transitions are guarded by constraints from underlying theories. Both the satisfiability of LTL-MT and the emptiness of SDWAs are undecidable, but the latter can be reduced to a system of constrained Horn clauses, which are supported by efficient solvers and ongoing research efforts. We discuss multiple applications of our approach beyond satisfiability, including model checking and runtime monitoring. Finally, a set of empirical experiments shows that our approach to satisfiability works at least as well as a previous custom solution.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Parameter Learning in Probabilistic Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter learning is a crucial task in the field of Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence: given a probabilistic logic program and a set of observations in the form of interpretations, the goal is to learn the probabilities of the facts in the program such that the probabilities of the interpretations are maximized. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to solve such a task within the formalism of Probabilistic Answer Set Programming, both based on the extraction of symbolic equations representing the probabilities of the interpretations. The first solves the task using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization solver while the second is based on an implementation of the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that our proposals often outperform existing approaches based on projected answer set enumeration in terms of quality of the solution and in terms of execution time. The paper has been accepted at the ICLP2024 conference and is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</description>

      <title>Complete representation by partial functions for signatures containing antidomain restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate notions of complete representation by partial functions, where the operations in the signature include antidomain restriction and may include composition, intersection, update, preferential union, domain, antidomain, and set difference. When the signature includes both antidomain restriction and intersection, the join-complete and the meet-complete representations coincide. Otherwise, for the signatures we consider, meet-complete is strictly stronger than join-complete. A necessary condition to be meet-completely representable is that the atoms are separating. For the signatures we consider, this condition is sufficient if and only if composition is not in the signature. For each of the signatures we consider, the class of (meet-)completely representable algebras is not axiomatisable by any existential-universal-existential first-order theory. For 14 expressively distinct signatures, we show, by giving an explicit representation, that the (meet-)completely representable algebras form a basic elementary class, axiomatisable by a universal-existential-universal first-order sentence. The signatures we axiomatise are those containing antidomain restriction and any of intersection, update, and preferential union and also those containing antidomain restriction, composition, and intersection and any of update, preferential union, domain, and antidomain.</description>

      <title>Middle Architecture Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mid-level ontologies are used to integrate terminologies and data across disparate domains. There are, however, no clear, defensible criteria for determining whether a given ontology should count as mid-level, because we lack a rigorous characterization of what the middle level of generality is supposed to contain. Attempts to provide such a characterization have failed, we believe, because they have focused on the goal of specifying what is characteristic of those single ontologies that have been advanced as mid-level ontologies. Unfortunately, single ontologies of this sort are generally a mixture of top- and mid-level, and sometimes even of domain-level terms. To gain clarity, we aim to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of one or more ontologies to inhabit what we call a mid-level architecture.</description>

      <title>The Common Core Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) are designed as a mid-level ontology suite that extends the Basic Formal Ontology. CCO has since been increasingly adopted by a broad group of users and applications and is proposed as the first standard mid-level ontology. Despite these successes, documentation of the contents and design patterns of the CCO has been comparatively minimal. This paper is a step toward providing enhanced documentation for the mid-level ontology suite through a discussion of the contents of the eleven ontologies that collectively comprise the Common Core Ontology suite.</description>

      <title>Capabilities: An Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, as in science and in all other domains, we encounter huge numbers of dispositions (tendencies, potentials, powers) which are realized in processes such as sneezing, sweating, shedding dandruff, and on and on. Among this plethora of what we can think of as mere dispositions is a subset of dispositions in whose realizations we have an interest a car responding well when driven on ice, a rabbits lungs responding well when it is chased by a wolf, and so on. We call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide a robust ontological account of what capabilities are that is of sufficient generality to serve a variety of purposes, for example by providing a useful extension to ontology-based research in areas where capabilities data are currently being collected in siloed fashion.</description>

      <title>Commutativity and liftings of codensity monads of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another universal property of probability monads as liftings of the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad and provide a novel characterisation of the Radon monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to \textbf{MonCat}, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is.</description>

      <title>Recomposition: A New Technique for Efficient Compositional Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional verification algorithms are well-studied in the context of model checking. Properly selecting components for verification is important for efficiency, yet has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we address this gap with a novel compositional verification framework that focuses on component selection as an explicit, first-class concept. The framework decomposes a system into components, which we then recompose into new components for efficient verification. At the heart of our technique is the recomposition map that determines how recomposition is performed; the component selection problem thus reduces to finding a good recomposition map. However, the space of possible recomposition maps can be large. We therefore propose heuristics to find a small portfolio of recomposition maps, which we then run in parallel. We implemented our techniques in a model checker for the TLA+ language. In our experiments, we show that our tool achieves competitive performance with TLC-a well-known model checker for TLA+-on a benchmark suite of distributed protocols.</description>
