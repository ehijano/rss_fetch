      <title>Distinguishing thermal fluctuations from polaron formation in halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Shear Horizontal Acoustic and Plasma Waves in Hexagonal Piezoelectric Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coupled acoustic and plasma waves in piezoelectric semiconductor crystals of hexagonal symmetry. We focus on the so called shear-horizontal or antiplane motions with one mechanical displacement. A set of two dimensional equations is reduced from the three-dimensional equations. Since the material is effectively isotropic in the two dimensional plane under consideration, the equations are relatively simple. Dispersion curves of coupled elastic and acoustic waves are obtained analytically and examined numerically along with the effects of some parameters.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in coherently strained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells on bulk AlN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in coherently strained, low-dislocation AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs), including both undoped and $\delta$-doped structures. SdH measurements reveal a single subband occupation in the undoped GaN QW and two subband occupation in the $\delta$-doped GaN QW. More importantly, SdH oscillations enable direct measurement of critical two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) parameters at the Fermi level: carrier density and ground state energy level, electron effective mass ($m^* \approx 0.289\,m_{\rm e}$ for undoped GaN QW and $m^* \approx 0.298\,m_{\rm e}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW), and quantum scattering time ($\tau_{\rm q} \approx 83.4 \, \text{fs}$ for undoped GaN QW and $\tau_{\rm q} \approx 130.6 \, \text{fs}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW). These findings provide important insights into the fundamental properties of 2DEGs that are strongly quantum confined in the thin GaN QWs, essential for designing nitride heterostructures for high-performance electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetal phases and intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity in SbAs ordered alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory calculations we investigated possible Weyl semimetal (WSM) phases in antimony arsenide ordered alloys Sb1-xAsx (x=0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 1). We find WSM phases for all As compositions of Sb1-xAsx with broken inversion symmetry, in contrast to Bi1-xSbx where only compositions x=1/2 and 5/6 were predicted to exhibit WSM phases. The WSM phases in Sb1-xAsx are characterized by the presence of 12 Weyl points, located within 55 meV from the Fermi level in the case of x=1/2. The robust spin-orbit coupling strength and Berry curvature in these alloys produce large spin-Hall conductivity in the range of 176-602 (hbar/e)(S/cm), comparable to that in the BiSb alloys. Finally, Sb0.5As0.5 is predicted to be almost lattice-matched to GaAs(111), with the Fermi level within the gap of the semiconductor, facilitating growth and characterization, and thus, offering promising integration with conventional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</description>

      <title>Impact of Annealing Temperature on the Energy Storage Performance of CoO2 Nanoparticles Synthesized via Solid State Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solid-state reaction was used to synthesize CoO2 nanostructured material. Cobalt nitrate tetrahydrate and sodium oxide (NaOH) were combined to produce CoO2 nanostructured material. The three synthesized working electrodes were each tested individually, using 3 M KOH as the electrolyte. The CV analysis of a three-electrode system revealed redox peaks, indicating Faradaic processes. The estimated specific capacitances of CoO2, CoO2 (250oC), CoO2 (300oC) nanostructured material at scan rates of (10) mVs-1 is (223, 348, and 473) Fg-1. The diffraction peaks at 2{\theta} = 26.264o, 33.527o, 37.579, 51.264 and 54.367o correspond respectively to the diffraction planes of 111, 112, 200, 211, and 311 of CoO2 nanostructured material. The annealing temperature, which affects the bandgap, can influence the size, shape, and crystallinity of nanostructures. For the unannealed material, the energy bandgap of CoO2 is 2.00 eV, whereas for the annealed material it ranges from 1.77 to 1.86 eV.</description>

      <title>CO2 adsorption mechanisms in hydrated silica nanopores: Insights from grand canonical Monte Carlo to classical and ab initio molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial phenomena in confined systems is important for optimizing CO2 capture technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of CO2 adsorption in hydrated amorphous silica nanopores through an integrated computational approach combining grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), classical molecular dynamics (MD), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The excess adsorption isotherms reveal a marked hydration dependence, with CO2 uptake decreasing from 7.6 to 2.6 mmol/g as water content increases from 1 to 15 wt%. Analysis of adsorption kinetics demonstrates a distinctive bimodal process, characterized by rapid initial uptake followed by slower diffusion-limited adsorption, with the latter becoming increasingly dominant at higher hydration levels. Classical MD simulations reveal an inverse correlation between hydration and CO2 mobility, with self-diffusion coefficients decreasing across the studied hydration range. Density profile analysis indicates a hydration-induced transition in CO2 distribution from central pore regions to surface-proximate domains, accompanied by restructuring of interfacial water networks. Notably, AIMD simulations capture previously unrecognized chemical processes, including proton transfer mechanisms leading to surface silanol formation with characteristic O-O distances of 2.4-2.5 {\AA}, and spontaneous CO2 hydration yielding carbonate species through water-mediated reaction pathways. These findings demonstrate the dual role of confined water as both a spatial competitor and reaction medium for CO2 capture, providing molecular-level insights with quantum mechanical accuracy for design of carbon capture materials.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive numerical analysis of doping controlled efficiency in lead free Cs(SnGe)I3 perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One effective way to prevent toxicity and improve the stability of materials for photovoltaic applications is to exclude lead and organic molecules from perovskite materials. Specifically, the CsSn1-xGexI3 appears to be a promising contender; nonetheless, it requires optimization, particularly bandgap tuning by doping concentration modifications. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of CsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite materials by varying composition in B site atoms. We use the solar cell capacitance (SCAPS-1D) simulator to compute device performance; however, it computes the absorption spectrum using a simplified mathematical function that approximates the actual spectrum. To achieve a quantum-mechanical level of accuracy DFT extracted parameters like absorption spectra and bandgap were fed into SCAPS-1D. We find that increasing the Ge concentration leads to a higher bandgap and improved absorption profile, thereby enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency. Thermal and field distribution analyses were also done for the optimized device through a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. By optimizing the absorber layer with a 75% Ge concentration, we achieve a remarkable PCE of 23.80%. Our findings guide future research in designing high-performance non-leaded halide PSCs, paving the way for low-cost, stable, and highly efficient solar cells through atomic doping-tuned perovskite absorber layers.</description>

      <title>Global Universal Scaling and Ultra-Small Parameterization in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Super-Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using machine learning (ML) to construct interatomic interactions and thus potential energy surface (PES) has become a common strategy for materials design and simulations. However, those current models of machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) provide no relevant physical constrains, and thus may owe intrinsic out-of-domain difficulty which underlies the challenges of model generalizability and physical scalability. Here, by incorporating physics-informed Universal-Scaling law and nonlinearity-embedded interaction function, we develop a Super-linear MLIP with both Ultra-Small parameterization and greatly expanded expressive capability, named SUS2-MLIP. Due to the global scaling rooting in universal equation of state (UEOS), SUS2-MLIP not only has significantly-reduced parameters by decoupling the element space from coordinate space, but also naturally outcomes the out-of-domain difficulty and endows the potentials with inherent generalizability and scalability even with relatively small training dataset. The nonlinearity-enbeding transformation for interaction function expands the expressive capability and make the potentials super-linear. The SUS2-MLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art MLIP models with its exceptional computational efficiency especially for multiple-element materials and physical scalability in property prediction. This work not only presents a highly-efficient universal MLIP model but also sheds light on incorporating physical constraints into artificial-intelligence-aided materials simulation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning for Revealing Structure-Property Relationships in Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning (EMML), which integrates the analysis of diverse data types (multimodal data) using factor analysis for feature extraction with Explainable AI (XAI), for carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers prepared from aqueous dispersions. This method is a powerful approach to elucidate the mechanisms governing material properties, where multi-stage fabrication conditions and multiscale structures have complex influences. Thus, in our case, this approach helps us understand how different processing steps and structures at various scales impact the final properties of CNT fibers. The analysis targeted structures ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale, including aggregation size distributions of CNT dispersions and the effective length of CNTs. Furthermore, because some types of data were difficult to interpret using standard methods, challenging-to-interpret distribution data were analyzed using Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for extracting key features that determine the outcome. Contribution analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) demonstrated that small, uniformly distributed aggregates are crucial for improving fracture strength, while CNTs with long effective lengths are significant factors for enhancing electrical conductivity. The analysis also identified thresholds and trends for these key factors to assist in defining the conditions needed to optimize CNT fiber properties. EMML is not limited to CNT fibers but can be applied to the design of other materials derived from nanomaterials, making it a useful tool for developing a wide range of advanced materials. This approach provides a foundation for advancing data-driven materials research.</description>

      <title>Origins of the anomalous Hall conductivity in the symmetry enforced Fe3GeTe2 nodal-line ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ has gained attention in the condensed matter community for its potential to be exfoliated into thin films with ferromagnetic (FM) order, thanks to its van der Waals layered structure and significant intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we analyze the electronic structure and show that, contrary to prior claims, the bulk of the AHC cannot arise from gapped nodal lines. By studying the material's symmetry properties, both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and across paramagnetic and FM phases, we find that Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ hosts mirror-symmetry-protected nodal lines, which support surface drumhead states. Additionally, we identify three key sources of AHC: nodal lines in the paramagnetic phase gapped by the FM order, Weyl points within specific energy ranges, and gaps between spin-up and spin-down bands caused by SOC. Finally, our calculations suggest that electron doping could increase the AHC up to four times compared to its value at the computed Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabaticity from first principles: the exact-factorization approach for solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thorough treatment of electron-lattice interactions from first principles is one of the main goals in condensed matter physics. While the commonly applied adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is sufficient for describing many physical phenomena, it is limited in its ability to capture meaningful features originating from non-adiabatic coupling effects. The exact factorization method, starting from the full Hamiltonian of electrons and nuclei, provides a way to systematically account for non-adiabatic effects. This formalism was recently developed into an ab initio density functional theory framework. Within this framework we here develop a perturbative approach to the electronic states in solid state materials. We derive exact-factorization-based perturbations of the Kohn-Sham states up to second order in the nuclear displacements. These non-adiabatic features in the calculated energy and wavefunction corrections are expressed in terms of readily available density functional perturbation theory components.</description>

      <title>A multiscale Bayesian approach to quantification and denoising of energy-dispersive x-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum imaging yields compositional information with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level. However, experimental limitations often produce extremely sparse and noisy EDX spectra. Under such conditions, every detected X-ray must be leveraged to obtain the maximum possible amount of information about the sample. To this end, we introduce a robust multiscale Bayesian approach that accounts for the Poisson statistics in the EDX data and leverages their underlying spatial correlations. This is combined with EDX spectral simulation (elemental contributions and Bremsstrahlung background) into a Bayesian estimation strategy. When tested using simulated datasets, the chemical maps obtained with this approach are more accurate and preserve a higher spatial resolution than those obtained by standard methods. These properties translate to experimental datasets, where the method enhances the atomic resolution chemical maps of a canonical tetragonal ferroelectric PbTiO3 sample, such that ferroelectric domains are mapped with unit-cell resolution.</description>

      <title>Effect of 3d Transition Metal Doping (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) on the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Pd Alloys at Low Impurity Concentrations: An Ab initio Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of low-impurity ferromagnetism remains a challenging problem in the solid-state community. Despite initial experiments dating back to the mid-20th century, a comprehensive theoretical explanation and reliable ab initio evaluations have remained elusive. The present research aims to bridge this gap by refining first-principle calculations by elucidating the magnetic and electronic behavior of Pd1-xMx alloys (where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Our study includes calculations of magnetic properties throughout the range of impurity concentrations, from 1 to 100 atomic percent (at.%), where we estimate critical concentrations and perform a comparative analysis for the listed alloys. Furthermore, electronic structure was analyzed, including the calculations of atomic, spin, and orbital-resolved states density, and exploration of the spatial formation of magnetic clusters containing ferromagnetic impurities across all concentration ranges.</description>

      <title>The Role of 11B4C Interlayers in Enhancing Fe/Si Multilayer Performance for Polarized Neutron Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of incorporating 11B4C interlayers into Fe/Si multilayers, with a focus on interface quality, reflectivity, polarization, and magnetic properties for polarized neutron optics. It is found that the introduction of 1 {\AA} and 2 {\AA} 11B4C interlayers significantly improves the interface sharpness, reducing interface width and preventing excessive Si diffusion into the Fe layers. X-ray reflectivity and polarized neutron reflectivity measurements show enhanced reflectivity and polarization, with a notable increase in polarization for 30 {\AA} period multilayers. The inclusion of interlayers also helps prevent the formation of iron-silicides, improving both the magnetic properties and neutron optical performance. However, the impact of interlayers is less pronounced in thicker-period multilayers (100 {\AA}), primarily due to the ratio between layer and interface widths. These results suggest that 11B4C interlayers offer a promising route for optimizing Fe/Si multilayer performance in polarized neutron mirrors.</description>

      <title>Diminished spin-flip reflectivity in stacked multilayers with varying period thicknesses of Fe/Si by incorporating 11B4C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of 11B4C co-sputtering on the structural and optical properties of Fe/Si stacked multilayers, with a focus on neutron supermirror applications. X-ray and neutron reflectivity techniques reveal that 11B4C incorporation improves interface sharpness, reduces roughness, and enhances reflectivity for all multilayer periods. Neutron reflectivity measurements show reduced spin-flip intensities, while wafer-curvature measurements indicate a 50% reduction in internal stress, allowing for higher mechanical stability of the multilayers. These improvements are attributed to the amorphization of Fe layers, which also suppress the formation of structural and magnetic domains responsible for stress and spin-flip scattering. In contrast, the pure Fe/Si sample exhibits a persistent half-order Bragg peak, indicating residual antiferromagnetic coupling. The results demonstrate that 11B4C enhances neutron optics by reducing spin-flip effects, increasing reflectivity and polarization, and alleviating stress, enabling the use of polarizers at reduced external fields compared to pure Fe/Si multilayers. These findings establish 11B4C as a transformative material for advancing neutron supermirror technology, paving the way for more efficient, stable, and high-performance polarizers in next-generation neutron optics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Domain Suppression in Fe/Si Multilayers with 11B4C Integration for Polarizing Neutron Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of boron carbide (B4C) addition on magnetic domains within Fe/Si multilayers through off-specular neutron scattering with polarization analysis. The incorporation of B4C induces amorphization in layers, disrupting magnetic domain structures. Analysis of the scattering patterns reveals that magnetic domains in pure Fe/Si multilayers exhibit no significant correlation between layers, resulting in a specific diffuse off-specular scattering signal, while the B4C incorporated Fe/Si multilayers revealed no diffuse off-specular scattering. We offer a qualitative interpretation of these scattering phenomena and accurately model the observed diffuse patterns using the distorted wave Born approximation. Low-energy {\mu}+SR measurements further reveal that local magnetic fields in Fe/Si and Fe/Si + B4C multilayers are more easily manipulated by external fields in B4C-containing layers, with enhanced field uniformity in the muon length-scale. Our findings provide insights into the role of B4C in altering magnetic domain arrangements within Fe/Si multilayers, contributing to advances in the design of magnetic materials and neutron polarization coatings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Phase Transitions of Yttrium: Insights from Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of structural phase transitions in rare-earth elements is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with significant implications for materials science applications. In this study, we present a systematic investigation on the phase transitions of yttrium under low-pressure conditions ($&lt;$30 GPa) focusing on the hcp, Sm-type, and dhcp phases. A comparative analysis of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-GGA functionals reveals that the PBE-GGA functional significantly underestimates the phase transition pressures, whereas the r$^2$SCAN functional provides accurate predictions of phase transition pressures which are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The results confirm that the phase transitions in yttrium are driven by vibrational instabilities, as evidenced by the emergence of soft acoustic modes in the phonon dispersion curves for the hcp and Sm-type phase. Elastic properties calculations further confirm mechanical softening at the phase boundaries, particularly in the hcp phase, suggesting a strong correlation between elastic instability and structural transitions. These findings suggest that the emergence of soft modes in the phonon dispersion curves might be a key factor driving the structural phase transition in the rare earth materials.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Behavior of Greenhouse Gases on Carbon Nanobelts: A Semi-Empirical Tight-Binding Approach for Environmental Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the adsorption characteristics of carbon nanobelts (CNB) and Mobius carbon nanobelts (MCNB) interacting with various greenhouse gases, including NH3, CO2, CO, H2S, CH4, CH3OH, NO2, NO, and COCl2. The study employs semi-empirical tight-binding calculations via xTB software, complemented by topological analysis using MULTIWFN software. Comparative analysis reveals MCNB's superior adsorption properties, particularly for specific gases. Notable adsorption energies for MCNB were measured at -1.595eV, -0.669eV, and -0.637eV for NO, COCl2, and NO2, respectively, significantly exceeding the corresponding CNB values of -0.636eV, -0.449eV, and -0.438eV. The investigation of desorption kinetics demonstrates rapid recovery times (sub-millisecond) for most gas-nanobelt interactions, with the notable exception of the MCNB+NO system, which exhibits persistent bonding. Topological analysis confirms chemisorption mechanisms for NO, COCl2, and NO2 on both nanobelt variants, characterized by complex hybridizations of covalent and non-covalent interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted in both packed configurations and dry air mixtures demonstrate the nanobelts' effective gas-attracting properties, maintaining consistent capture performance across different environmental conditions. These findings establish carbon nanobelts, particularly the Mobius configuration, as promising candidates for greenhouse gas capture technologies, offering potential applications in environmental remediation and climate change mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Honegumi: An Interface for Accelerating the Adoption of Bayesian Optimization in the Experimental Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful tool for guiding experimental design and decision- making in various scientific fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. However, despite its growing popularity, the complexity of existing BO libraries and the steep learning curve associated with them can deter researchers who are not well-versed in machine learning or programming. To address this barrier, we introduce Honegumi, a user-friendly, interactive tool designed to simplify the process of creating advanced Bayesian optimization scripts. Honegumi offers a dynamic selection grid that allows users to configure key parameters of their optimization tasks, generating ready-to-use, unit-tested Python scripts tailored to their specific needs. Accompanying the interface is a comprehensive suite of tutorials that provide both conceptual and practical guidance, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. Built on top of the Ax platform, Honegumi leverages the power of existing state-of-the-art libraries while restructuring the user experience to make advanced BO techniques more accessible to experimental researchers. By lowering the barrier to entry and providing educational resources, Honegumi aims to accelerate the adoption of advanced Bayesian optimization methods across various domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To veryfy "hot supreconductivity" recently proposed in lanthanum hydride-based compounds, we explored thermodynamically stable and superconducting phases in the lanthanum (La)-platinum (Pt)-hydrogen (H) ternary system at 20 GPa using an evolutionary construction scheme of a formation-enthalpy convex hull, universal neural network potential calculations, and density functional theory calculations. Although we found no evidence of the hot superconductivity in this ternary system, we predicted a unique compound, LaPtH$_{ 6 }$, which has equilateral triangular H$_{ 3 }$ units nearly forming a two-dimensional kagome lattice between La and Pt layers and shows the superconductivity at 18.67 K. This structure is dynamically stable from ambient pressure to at least 200 GPa and the superconducting critical temperature increases from 13.51 to 40.63 K.</description>

      <title>CAST: Cross Attention based multimodal fusion of Structure and Text for materials property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have revolutionized property prediction in materials science and accelerating material discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs) stand out due to their ability to represent crystal structures as graphs, effectively capturing local interactions and delivering superior predictions. However, these methods often lose critical global information, such as crystal systems and repetitive unit connectivity. To address this, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal fusion model that integrates graph and text modalities to preserve essential material information. CAST combines node- and token-level features using cross-attention mechanisms, surpassing previous approaches reliant on material-level embeddings like graph mean-pooling or [CLS] tokens. A masked node prediction pretraining strategy further enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up to 22.9\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties including band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat. Pretraining was key to aligning node and text embeddings, with attention maps confirming its effectiveness in capturing relationships between nodes and tokens. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning in materials science, paving the way for more robust predictive models that incorporate both local and global information.</description>

      <title>Spin dependent fluorescence mediated by anti-symmetric exchange in triplet exciton pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are spin-dependent phenomena critical to optoelectronics. The dynamics of spin populations during geminate triplet pair separation are crucial for controlling fission and TTA rates. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induces level crossings between spin manifolds, affecting spin populations and TTA rates in crystalline fission semiconductors. By investigating spin-dependent fluorescence in a triplet exciton pair with the magnetic field aligned along the fine structure tensor, we isolate the effect of DMI, as the triplet wavefunctions remain unaffected by the field. Our results reveal that DMI introduces additional TTA pathways that are forbidden by spin conservation, explaining the observed evolution of optically detected magnetic resonance signals with varying magnetic field. This study highlights the significant impact of DMI on the optical properties of triplet excitons, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in these systems.</description>

      <title>On the use of neural networks for the structural characterization of polymeric porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural characterization is an essential task in the study of porous materials. To achieve reliable results, it requires to evaluate images with hundreds of pores. Current methods require large time amounts and are subjected to human errors and subjectivity. A completely automatic tool would not only speed up the process but also enhance its reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is the study of a deep-learning-based technique for the structural characterization of porous materials, through the use of a convolutional neural network. Several fine-tuned Mask R CNN models are evaluated using different training configurations in four separate datasets each composed of numerous SEM images of diverse polymeric porous materials: closed-pore extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PU), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and open-pore PU. Results prove the tool capable of providing very accurate results, equivalent to those achieved by time consuming manual methods, in a matter of seconds.</description>

      <title>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Detection of chiral spin fluctuations driven by frustration in Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered states, such as chiral spin liquids, have been proposed as candidates that host fractionalized excitations. However, detecting chiral character or proximity to these non-trivial states remains a challenge. Resonant Raman scattering can be a powerful tool for detecting chiral fluctuations, as the $A_{2g}$ channel probes excitations with broken time-reversal symmetry and local chiral order. Here, we use exact diagonalization to characterize the resonant $A_{2g}$ channel, alongside two-magnon scattering in $B_{1g}$ and $E_g$ channels, for the Hubbard model on lattices with increasing levels of geometric spin frustration, where tuning the incident energy near the Mott gap reveals strong chiral spin excitation intensity. Increased spin frustration in the Mott insulator results in an overall softening of the Raman $A_{2g}$ response, indicating a tendency toward low energy chiral-chiral fluctuations in Mott insulators with magnetic frustration and proximity to chiral spin liquid states that can potentially be tuned by external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense light-field can dress both Bloch electrons inside crystals and photo-emitted free electrons in the vacuum, dubbed as Floquet and Volkov states respectively. These quantum states can further interfere coherently, modulating light-field dressed states. Here, we report experimental evidence of the Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor - black phosphorus. A highly asymmetric modulation of the spectral weight is observed for the Floquet-Volkov states, and such asymmetry can be further controlled by rotating the pump polarization. Our work reveals the quantum interference between different light-field dressed electronic states, providing insights for material engineering on the ultrafast timescale.</description>

Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Cavity Vacuum and Emergent Gyrotropic Effects in Embedded moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moir\'{e} superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moir\'{e} superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moir\'{e} superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.</description>

      <title>Low thermal noise mirror coatings utilising titanium dioxide and germanium dioxide mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upgrades to ground-based gravitational-wave observatories will require mirror coatings with reduced thermal noise, enabling improved detector sensitivity and extended astrophysical reach. Recent studies have shown that optical coatings utilising amorphous materials that exhibit a larger fraction of corner-sharing between adjacent structural units of metal-centered polyhedra are a promising route for reducing mechanical dissipation and thus thermal noise at room temperature. We report on multilayer optical coatings that are fabricated using germanium dioxide mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$) for the high index layers, and silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) for the low index material. Single layers of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ are characterised to optimise the mixture proportion and based on that highly reflective multilayer stacks were deposited. Exceptional optical absorption at 1064 nm below 1 part-per-million (ppm) is observed in the multilayer stacks after heat treatment. The annealing process also induces the formation of blisters which leads to increased optical scattering. However, there is indication that blisters can be suppressed by decreasing the water partial pressure in the deposition chamber. Direct thermal noise measurements provide experimental verification of a significant 25\% reduction of thermal noise over the mirrors currently employed, which combined with sub-ppm levels of optical absorption show the potential of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Materials and spin characteristics of amino-terminated nanodiamonds embedded with nitrogen-vacancy color centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the MT sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, which for practical applications is on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the energy dependence of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</description>

      <title>Mapping Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin-orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogenization is a fundamental technique for estimating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. Among Homogenization methods, the FFT-based Homogenization algorithm has become widely used due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle complex microstructures. Nevertheless, even with GPU acceleration, FFT-based Homogenization for industrial applications remains excessively time-consuming, particularly when generating elastic training data for AI models. This is due to the curse of dimensionality, which arises from the algorithms reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, creating a fundamental bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that leverages the improved time complexity of a Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. By additionally exploiting structural properties of the underlying microstructure, our method achieves exponential improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based technique - all while remaining executable on classical hardware. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across increasingly complex microstructures, demonstrating its potential advantages and limitations.</description>

      <title>Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP</title>

Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh interfacial thermal conductance for cooling gallium oxide electronics using cubic boron arsenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$) has attracted significant interest for its unique potential especially in power electronics. However, its low and anisotropic thermal conductivity poses a major challenge for heat dissipation. Here, we explore an effective cooling strategy centering on the heterogeneous integration of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices with cubic boron arsenide (cBAs), an emerging material with an ultrahigh thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of ~1300 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Machine-learned potentials for representative $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/cBAs interfaces are trained, enabling accurate and efficient calculation of the interfacial thermal conductance $G$ via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. At 300 K, remarkable $G$ values of 749$\pm$33 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and 824$\pm$35 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ are predicted for Ga-As and O-B bonding across the interface, respectively, which are primarily attributed to the well-matched phonon density of states considering the similar Debye temperatures of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and cBAs. Moreover, finite-element simulations directly show a notable device temperature reduction when comparing cBAs with other substrates. The simultaneously ultrahigh $\kappa$ and $G$ highlight cBAs as an ideal substrate for Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics.</description>

Abstract: For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density acting as a proxy for computing power as a function of time. While this trend started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon. We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify the roles of various stakeholders in this process.</description>

      <title>Quasi-phase-matched up- and down-conversion in periodically poled layered semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics lies at the heart of classical and quantum light generation. The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.</description>

      <title>Tunable Spatiotemporal Orders in Driven Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe$_{2}$ induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the previously observed magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward theoretical criterion for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment systems.</description>
