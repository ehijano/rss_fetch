      <title>Markovian dissipation can stabilize a (localization) quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of localized many-body bound states in an interacting open lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil the mechanism for the formation of puzzled boundary-localized bound states in a spinless fermionic open lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. By solving the Bethe-ansatz equation analytically, we uncover asymmetrical string solutions corresponding to the boundary-localized bound states, which emerge in systems with at least three particles. The localized bound states can become bound states in continuum in a suitable parameter region. When the number of particles increases to five or more, additional bound states away from the edge are also observed. Through rigorous analysis, we derive recurrence relations of the quasi-momentum of the localized states as a function of the number of particles, predicting the presence of hierarchy of localized many-body bound states in interacting open lattices.</description>

      <title>Parton Mean-Field Theory of a Rydberg Quantum Spin Liquid induced by Density-Dependent Peierls Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a parton mean-field Hamiltonian for Rydberg excitations on a honeycomb lattice with nearest and density-dependent, complex next-nearest neighbor hopping. Numerical results obtained from exact diagonalization of small systems have given indications for a ground state that is a chiral spin liquid (CSL) [Phys.Rev.Res. 5, 013157 (2023)]. Here we provide further evidence for this. Calculating the ground-state wavefunction self-consistently, we show that the mean-field Hamiltonian fulfills the requirements for a CSL ground state, resulting from a projected symmetry group classification and verify the expected twofold topological degeneracy on a torus. Furthermore we find very good overlap with the ground-state wavefunctions obtained by exact diagonalization of the original Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Bridging the classical and quantum regimes in a dissipative Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide an effective description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.</description>

      <title>Two identical 1D anyons with zero-range interactions: Exchange statistics, scattering theory, and anyon-anyon mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While elementary particles obey either bosonic or fermionic exchange statistics, generalized exchange statistics that interpolate between bosons and fermions -- applicable to quasi-particles -- constitute an intriguing topic, both from the fundamental and practical points of view. This work develops a scattering framework for two identical 1D bosonic anyons and two identical 1D fermionic anyons with zero-range contact interactions. The two-body system with zero-range interactions, both in free space and under external confinement, is used to illustrate the recently proposed bosonic-anyon -- fermionic-anyon mapping~(R. Hidalgo-Sacoto {\em{et al.}}, arXiv:2505.17669), which connects the eigenstates of bosonic anyons to those of fermionic anyons and vice versa. Performing explicit calculations for two-particle systems, the momentum distributions and the off-diagonal correlations of the single-particle density matrix for bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons are confirmed to be distinct. We also confirm the previously derived asymptotic coefficients of the momentum distribution tail at orders $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ for two harmonically confined anyons. Non-universal contributions at order $k^{-4}$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Space magnetometry with a differential atom interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers deployed in space are excellent tools for high precision measurements, navigation, or Earth observation. In particular, differential interferometric setups feature common-mode noise suppression and enable reliable measurements in the presence of ambient platform noise. Here we report on orbital magnetometry campaigns performed with differential single- and double-loop interferometers in NASA's Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station. By comparing measurements with atoms in magnetically sensitive and insensitive states, we have realized atomic magnetometers mapping magnetic field curvatures. Our results pave the way towards precision quantum sensing missions in space.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Eigenstate Thermalization for Non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-particle self-consistent approach for broken symmetry phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of interacting fermion systems constitutes a major challenge for many-body theory due to the proliferation of new independent scattering channels once absent or degenerate in the symmetric phase. One example is given by the ferro/antiferromagnetic broken symmetry phase (BSP) of the Hubbard model, where vertices in the spin-transverse and spin-longitudinal channels become independent with a consequent increase in the computational power for their calculation. We generalise the non-perturbative Two-Particle- Self-Consistent method (TPSC) to address broken SU(2) magnetic phases in the Hubbard model, offering an efficient approach that incorporates strong correlations. We show that in the BSP, the sum-rule enforcement of susceptibilities must be accompanied by a modified gap equation resulting in a renormalisation of the order parameter, vertex corrections and the preservation of the gap-less feature of the Goldstone modes. We then apply the theory to the antiferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model in the cubic lattice at half-filling. We compare our results of double occupancies and staggered magnetisation to the ones obtained using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo showing excellent quantitative agreement. We demonstrate how vertex corrections play a central role in lowering the Higgs resonance with respect to the quasi-particle excitation gap in the spin-longitudinal susceptibility, yielding a well visible Higgs-mode.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and topological phases in correlated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a two-dimensional Hubbard model adapted to host altermagnetic states. Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we uncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their spectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a result corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at finite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at high energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the non-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal that this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency dependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field theory. We identify distinctive dynamical signatures of correlated altermagnetic states in the spin-resolved optical conductivity, notably a double-peak structure likely linked to high-energy Dirac cone-like bands. Moreover, the spin-resolved response exhibits spin-selective activation at different photon energies, pointing to potential applications in spin-dependent optical control. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a topological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and temperature.</description>
