      <title>A note on the scatteredness of reflection orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we characterize affine Coxeter systems among all Coxeter systems in terms of the structure of their reflection orders. For an infinite irreducible system $(W,S)$, we show that affineness is equivalently characterized by the scatteredness of all reflection orders, by the existence of a reflection order of type $\omega+\omega^*$, and by a finiteness property of intervals determined by dihedral reflection subgroups. Our proof exploits the geometry of projective roots, the isotropic cone and the universal reflection subgroups in an infinite non-affine Coxeter group.</description>

      <title>On left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to take the study of Dedekind braces, that is, left braces for which every subbrace is an ideal, started in a previous paper, further. Dedekind braces $A$ whose additive group is non-periodic are analysed. We prove sufficient conditions for $A$ to be abelian: it is enough that every element is $2$-nilpotent for the star operation; and, if $A$ is hypermultipermutational, it suffices that the additive group of the socle is torsion-free. Both conditions can be translated in terms of set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we prove a structural theorem for the case of $A$ to be a multipermutational brace of level $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Dekimpe, De Rock and Penninckx concerning the existence of eigenvalues one in certain elements of finite groups acting irreducibly on a real vector space of odd dimension. This yields a sufficient condition for a closed flat manifold to be an $R_{\infty}$-manifold.</description>

      <title>The Addition Theorem for the Algebraic Entropy of Torsion Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09643v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Addition Theorem for the algebraic entropy of group endomorphisms of torsion abelian groups was proved by Dikranjan, Goldsmith, Salce and Zanardo. It was later extended by Shlossberg to torsion nilpotent groups of class 2. As our main result, we prove the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms of torsion nilpotent groups of arbitrary nilpotency class. As an application, we show that if $G$ is a torsion nilpotent group, then for every $\phi\in \mathrm{End}(G)$ either the entropy $h(\phi)$ is infinite or $h(\phi)=\log(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in\mathbb N$. We further obtain, for automorphisms of locally finite groups, the Addition Theorem with respect to all terms of the upper central series; in particular, the Addition Theorem holds for automorphisms of $\omega$-hypercentral groups. Finally, we establish a reduction principle: if $\mathfrak X$ is a variety of locally finite groups, then the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms holds in $\mathfrak X$ if and only if it holds for locally finite groups generated by bounded sets.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Complexity via Symmetry and Homomorphism Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valiant's conjecture asserts that the circuit complexity classes VP and VNP are distinct, meaning that the permanent does not admit polynomial-size algebraic circuits. As it is the case in many branches of complexity theory, the unconditional separation of these complexity classes seems elusive. In stark contrast, the symmetric analogue of Valiant's conjecture has been proven by Dawar and Wilsenach (2020): the permanent does not admit symmetric algebraic circuits of polynomial size, while the determinant does. Symmetric algebraic circuits are both a powerful computational model and amenable to proving unconditional lower bounds.
  In this paper, we develop a symmetric algebraic complexity theory by introducing symmetric analogues of the complexity classes VP, VBP, and VF called symVP, symVBP, and symVF. They comprise polynomials that admit symmetric algebraic circuits, skew circuits, and formulas, respectively, of polynomial orbit size. Having defined these classes, we show unconditionally that $\mathsf{symVF} \subsetneq \mathsf{symVBP} \subsetneq \mathsf{symVP}$. To that end, we characterise the polynomials in symVF and symVBP as those that can be written as linear combinations of homomorphism polynomials for patterns of bounded treedepth and pathwidth, respectively. This extends a previous characterisation by Dawar, Pago, and Seppelt (2026) of symVP.
  Finally, we show that symVBP and symVP contain homomorphism polynomials which are VBP- and VP-complete, respectively. We give general graph-theoretic criteria for homomorphism polynomials and their linear combinations to be VBP-, VP-, or VNP-complete. These conditional lower bounds drastically enlarge the realm of natural polynomials known to be complete for VNP, VP, or VBP. Under the assumption VFPT $\neq$ VW[1], we precisely identify the homomorphism polynomials that lie in VP as those whose patterns have bounded treewidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a primitive permutation action of the Steinberg triality group $^3D_4(2)$ of degree $4064256$ and show that there are distinct points $\alpha,\beta$ such that there is no derangement $g\in{^3D_4}(2)$ with $\alpha^g=\beta$. This answers a question by John G. Thompson (Problem 8.75 in the Kourovka Notebook) in the negative.</description>

      <title>Bi-orderability and generalized torsion elements from the perspective of profinite properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using fiber products, we construct bi-orderable groups from left-orderable groups. As an application, we show that bi-orderability is not a profinite property, answering a question of Piwek and Wykowski negatively. We also show that the existence of a generalized torsion element is not a profinite property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that non-positively curved $k$-fold triangle groups have finitely many cone types, and hence a regular language of all geodesics. Further, we prove that the language of lexicographically first geodesics is both regular and satisfies the fellow traveller property, giving an automatic structure for this family of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the congruence subgroup property for the centralizer of a finite subgroup $G$ in the mapping class group of a hyperbolic oriented and connected surface of finite topological type $S$ such that the genus of the quotient surface $S/G$ is at most $2$. As an application, we show that torsion elements in the mapping class group of a surface of genus $\leq 2$ are conjugacy distinguished.</description>

      <title>Constructing Chayet-Garibaldi algebras from affine vertex algebras (including the 3876-dimensional algebra for $E_8$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Maurice Chayet and Skip Garibaldi provided an explicit construction of a commutative non-associative algebra on the second smallest representation of $E_8$ (of dimension $3875$) adjoined with a unit. In fact, they define such an algebra $A(\mathfrak{g})$ for each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of explicit but ad-hoc formulas.
  We discovered that their algebras $A(\mathfrak{g})$ have a natural interpretation in terms of affine vertex algebras, and their ad-hoc formulas take an extremely simple form in this new interpretation. It is our hope that this point of view will lead to a better understanding of this interesting class of algebras.</description>

      <title>Quiver presentations for band algebras are defined over the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</description>
