      <title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence of Things Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)coupled with existing Internet of Things (IoT) enables more streamlined and autonomous operations across various economic sectors. Consequently, the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) having AI techniques at its core implies additional energy and carbon costs that may become significant with more complex neural architectures. To better understand the energy and Carbon Footprint (CF) of some AIoT components, very recent studies employ conventional metrics. However, these metrics are not designed to capture energy efficiency aspects of inference. In this paper, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AIoT Lifecycle (eCAL) to capture the overall energy cost of inference over the lifecycle of an AIoT system. We devise a new methodology for determining eCAL of an AIoT system by analyzing the complexity of data manipulation in individual components involved in the AIoT lifecycle and derive the overall and per bit energy consumption. With eCAL we show that the better a model is and the more it is used, the more energy efficient an inference is. For an example AIoT configuration, eCAL for making $100$ inferences is $1.43$ times higher than for $1000$ inferences. We also evaluate the CF of the AIoT system by calculating the equivalent CO$_{2}$ emissions based on the energy consumption and the Carbon Intensity (CI) across different countries. Using 2023 renewable data, our analysis reveals that deploying an AIoT system in Germany results in emitting $4.62$ times higher CO$_2$ than in Finland, due to latter using more low-CI energy sources.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Behavioral Test Cases For Natural Language Processing Using Clustering and Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in behavioral testing for natural language processing (NLP) models, such as Checklist, is inspired by related paradigms in software engineering testing. They allow evaluation of general linguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness and identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The current packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires domain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to develop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It clusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply prompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-known Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral test profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths of those models.</description>

      <title>Scaling and assigning resources on ion trap QCCD architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion trap technologies have earned significant attention as potential candidates for quantum information processing due to their long decoherence times and precise manipulation of individual qubits, distinguishing them from other candidates in the field of quantum technologies. However, scalability remains a challenge, as introducing additional qubits into a trap increases noise and heating effects, consequently decreasing operational fidelity. Trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures have addressed this limitation by interconnecting multiple traps and employing ion shuttling mechanisms to transfer ions among traps. This new architectural design requires the development of novel compilation techniques for quantum algorithms, which efficiently allocate and route qubits, and schedule operations. The aim of a compiler is to minimize ion movements and, therefore, reduce the execution time of the circuit to achieve a higher fidelity.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for initial qubit placement, demonstrating enhancements of up to 50\% compared to prior methods. Furthermore, we conduct a scalability analysis on two distinct QCCD topologies: a 1D-linear array and a ring structure. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of the excess capacity -- i.e. the number of free spaces within a trap -- on the algorithm performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Implementation of Discrete-time Quantum Walks in Any Finite-dimensional Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown that quantum walks can accelerate certain quantum algorithms and act as a universal paradigm for quantum processing. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, owing to its discrete nature, stands out as one of the most suitable choices for circuit implementation. Nevertheless, most current implementations are characterized by extensive, multi-layered quantum circuits, leading to higher computational expenses and a notable decrease in the number of confidently executable time steps on current quantum computers. Since quantum computers are not scalable enough in this NISQ era, we also must confine ourselves to the ancilla-free frontier zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have successfully cut down the circuit cost concerning gate count and circuit depth by half through our proposed methodology in qubit systems as compared to the state-of-the-art increment-decrement approach. Furthermore, for the engineering excellence of our proposed approach, we implement DTQW in any finite-dimensional quantum system with akin efficiency. To ensure an efficient implementation of quantum walks without requiring ancilla, we have incorporated an intermediate qudit technique for decomposing multi-qubit gates. Experimental outcomes hold significance far beyond the realm of just a few time steps, laying the groundwork for dependable implementation and utilization on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to $32$ qubits and $5$ QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter tuning on a trapped-ion processor.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Annealers with Near-Optimal Minor-Embedded Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking Quantum Process Units (QPU) at an application level usually requires considering the whole programming stack of the quantum computer. One critical task is the minor-embedding (resp. transpilation) step, which involves space-time overheads for annealing-based (resp. gate-based) quantum computers. This paper establishes a new protocol to generate graph instances with their associated near-optimal minor-embedding mappings to D-Wave Quantum Annealers (QA). This set of favorable mappings is used to generate a wide diversity of optimization problem instances. We use this method to benchmark QA on large instances of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems and compare the performance of the QPU with efficient classical solvers. The benchmark aims to evaluate and quantify the key characteristics of instances that could benefit from the use of a quantum computer. In this context, existing QA seem best suited for unconstrained problems on instances with densities less than $10\%$. For constrained problems, the penalty terms used to encode the hard constraints restrict the performance of QA and suggest that these QPU will be less efficient on these problems of comparable size.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>
