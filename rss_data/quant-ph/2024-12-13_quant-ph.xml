      <title>Development and Justification of a Physical Layer Model Based on Monitoring Data for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technique for ensuring long-term security in communication systems. Unlike conventional key exchange methods like RSA, which quantum computers could theoretically break [1], QKD offers enhanced security based on quantum mechanics [2]. Despite its maturity and commercial availability, QKD devices often have undisclosed implementations and are tamper-protected. This thesis addresses the practical imperfections of QKD systems, such as low and fluctuating Secret Key Rates (SKR) and unstable performance. By applying theoretical SKR derivations to measurement data from a QKD system in Poland, we gain insights into current system performance and develop machine learning (ML) models to predict system behavior.
  Our methodologies include creating a theoretical QKD model [2] and implementing ML models using tools like Keras (TensorFlow [3]). Key findings reveal that while theoretical models offer foundational insights, ML models provide superior accuracy in forecasting QKD system performance, adapting to environmental and operational parameters. This thesis highlights the limitations of theoretical models and underscores the practical relevance of ML models for QKD systems.
  Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive physical layer model capable of doing long-term forcasting of the SKR. Such a model could prevent an encryption system form running out of keys if the SKR drops significantly. In summary, this thesis establishes a foundational approach for using ML models to predict QKD system performance, paving the way for future advancements in SKR long-term predictions.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the loss-noise robustness trade-off in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a theoretically secure method to share secret keys, yet practical implementations face challenges due to noise and loss over long-distance channels. Traditional QKD protocols require extensive noise compensation, hindering their industrial scalability and lowering the achievable key rates. Alternative protocols encode logical qubits in noise-resilient states, but at the cost of using many physical qubits, increasing susceptibility to loss and limiting transmission distance. In this work, we introduce a logical qubit encoding that uses antisymmetric Bell-states in the continuous photonic degrees of freedom, frequency and time. By leveraging the continuous space, we overcome this noise-loss robustness trade-off by minimising the number of photons per logical qubit, whilst optimising the encoding resilience over noise fluctuations. We analyse the security of our encoding and demonstrate its robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. This approach provides a path towards scalable, efficient QKD implementations under realistic noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Short-time simulation of quantum dynamics by Pauli measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of complex quantum systems is a central application of quantum devices. Here, we propose leveraging the power of measurements to simulate short-time quantum dynamics of physically prepared quantum states in classical post-processing using a truncated Taylor series approach. While limited to short simulation times, our hybrid quantum-classical method is equipped with rigorous error bounds. It is extendable to estimate low-order Taylor approximations of smooth, time-dependent functions of tractable linear combinations of measurable operators. These insights can be made use of in the context of Hamiltonian learning and device verification, short-time imaginary time evolution, or the application of intractable operations to sub-universal quantum simulators in classical post-processing.</description>

      <title>Separability Lindblad equation for dynamical open-system entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing entanglement for the design of quantum technologies in the presence of noise constitutes today's main challenge in quantum information science. A framework is required that assesses the build-up of entanglement in realistic settings. In this work, we put forth a new class of nonlinear quantum master equations in Lindblad form that unambiguously identify dynamical entanglement in open quantum systems via deviations from a separable evolution. This separability Lindblad equation restricts quantum trajectories to classically correlated states only. Unlike many conventional approaches, here the entangling capabilities of a process are not characterized by input-output relations, but separability is imposed at each instant of time. We solve these equations for crucial examples, thereby quantifying the dynamical impact of entanglement in non-equilibrium scenarios. Our results allow to benchmark the engineering of entangled states through dissipation. The separability Lindblad equation provides a unique path to characterizing quantum correlations caused by arbitrary system-bath interactions, specifically tailored for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>A quantum-classical reinforcement learning model to play Atari games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have demonstrated the potential of quantum learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits as an alternative to deep learning models. On the one hand, these findings have shown the ultimate exponential speed-ups in learning that full-blown quantum models can offer in certain -- artificially constructed -- environments. On the other hand, they have demonstrated the ability of experimentally accessible PQCs to solve OpenAI Gym benchmarking tasks. However, it remains an open question whether these near-term QRL techniques can be successfully applied to more complex problems exhibiting high-dimensional observation spaces. In this work, we bridge this gap and present a hybrid model combining a PQC with classical feature encoding and post-processing layers that is capable of tackling Atari games. A classical model, subjected to architectural restrictions similar to those present in the hybrid model is constructed to serve as a reference. Our numerical investigation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model is capable of solving the Pong environment and achieving scores comparable to the classical reference in Breakout. Furthermore, our findings shed light on important hyperparameter settings and design choices that impact the interplay of the quantum and classical components. This work contributes to the understanding of near-term quantum learning models and makes an important step towards their deployment in real-world RL scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</description>

      <title>Restricted Monte Carlo wave function method and Lindblad equation for identifying entangling open-quantum-system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the Monte Carlo wave function approach that unambiguously identifies dynamical entanglement in general composite, open systems. Our algorithm performs tangential projections onto the set of separable states, leading to classically correlated quantum trajectories. By comparing this restricted evolution with the unrestricted one, we can characterize the entangling capabilities of quantum channels without making use of input-output relations. Moreover, applying this method is equivalent to solving the nonlinear master equation in Lindblad form introduced in \cite{PAH24} for two-qubit systems. We here extend these equations to multipartite systems of qudits, describing non-entangling dynamics in terms of a stochastic differential equation. We identify the impact of dynamical entanglement in open systems by applying our approach to several correlated decay processes. Therefore, our methodology provides a complete and ready-to-use framework to characterize dynamical quantum correlations caused by arbitrary open-system processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Engines and Heat Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implementation of quantum engines and quantum heat pumps where the quantum adiabatic transformations are replaced by quantum Zeno strokes. During these strokes, frequent measurements are selectively performed on the external state of the system avoiding transition between different levels. This effectively delivers almost ideal isoentropic transformations. We concentrate on the characterization of the performance of a quantum Zeno heat pump implemented with a quantum harmonic oscillator, showing that optimal performance can be achieved faster than with shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques.</description>

      <title>Can Schroedingerist Wavefunction Physics Explain Brownian Motion? III: A One-Dimensional Heavy and Light Particles Model Exhibiting Brownian-Motion-Like Trajectories and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant makes an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincare and Einstein in the previous century.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on many-body spin cluster intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-quantum coherence (MQC) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing spin clusters, offering insights into diverse materials and quantum many-body systems. However, prior experiments have revealed a rapid decay in MQC intensities as the coherence order increases, restricting observable cluster sizes to the square root of the total system size. In this work, we establish fundamental bounds on observable MQC intensities in the thermodynamic limit outside the weak polarisation limit. We identify a sharp transition point in the observable MQC intensities as the coherence order grows. This transition points fragments the state space into two components consisting of observable and unobservable spin clusters. Notably, we find that this transition point is directly proportional to the size $N$ and polarization $p$ of the system, suggesting that the aforementioned square root limitation can be overcome through hyperpolarization techniques. Our results provide important experimental guidelines for the observation of large spin cluster phenomena.</description>

      <title>Parity symmetry breaking of spin-$j$ coherent state superpositions in Gaussian noise channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner function and Wigner-Yanase skew information are connected through quantum coherence. States with high skew information often exhibit more pronounced negative regions in their Wigner functions, indicative of quantum interference and non-classical behavior. Thus, the relationship between these two concepts is that states with high quantum coherence tend to display more non-classical features in their Wigner functions. By exploiting this relationship, which manifests as parity symmetry and asymmetry, we analyze parity symmetry and asymmetry in the superposition of two spin coherent states for a spin-$1/2$, as well as for a general spin-$j$. This analysis shows that the preservation of the parity asymmetry, or the violation of the parity symmetry, correlates with an increase in the value of spin $j$. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of parity symmetry and asymmetry of these states subjected to a Gaussian noise channel. Specifically, we examine how this parity symmetry and asymmetry change and identify the points at which parity symmetry is violated in the spin-$1/2$ cat state. Notably, the violation of parity symmetry becomes more pronounced at higher values of the decoherence parameter $s$. Our study shows how the spin value $j$ affects the breaking of parity symmetry in general spin-$j$ cat states that are hit by Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train-Based Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Quantum-Train-Based Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Dist-QTRL), a novel approach to addressing the scalability challenges of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) by integrating quantum computing principles. Quantum-Train Reinforcement Learning (QTRL) leverages parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate neural network parameters, achieving a \(poly(\log(N))\) reduction in the dimensionality of trainable parameters while harnessing quantum entanglement for superior data representation. The framework is designed for distributed multi-agent environments, where multiple agents, modeled as Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), operate in parallel, enabling faster convergence and enhanced scalability. Additionally, the Dist-QTRL framework can be extended to high-performance computing (HPC) environments by utilizing distributed quantum training for parameter reduction in classical neural networks, followed by inference using classical CPUs or GPUs. This hybrid quantum-HPC approach allows for further optimization in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Dist-QTRL framework and explore its convergence properties, supported by empirical results demonstrating performance improvements over centric QTRL models. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced RL in tackling complex, high-dimensional tasks, particularly in distributed computing settings, where our framework achieves significant speedups through parallelization without compromising model accuracy. This work paves the way for scalable, quantum-enhanced RL systems in practical applications, leveraging both quantum and classical computational resources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Quantum Kernel-Based Long short-memory (QK-LSTM) network, which integrates quantum kernel methods into classical LSTM architectures to enhance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency in climate time-series forecasting tasks, such as Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. By embedding classical inputs into high-dimensional quantum feature spaces, QK-LSTM captures intricate nonlinear dependencies and temporal dynamics with fewer trainable parameters. Leveraging quantum kernel methods allows for efficient computation of inner products in quantum spaces, addressing the computational challenges faced by classical models and variational quantum circuit-based models. Designed for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, QK-LSTM supports scalable hybrid quantum-classical implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that QK-LSTM outperforms classical LSTM networks in AQI forecasting, showcasing its potential for environmental monitoring and resource-constrained scenarios, while highlighting the broader applicability of quantum-enhanced machine learning frameworks in tackling large-scale, high-dimensional climate datasets.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Structure for Amplitude-Mixing Error-Transparent Gates for Binomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic encodings of quantum information offer hardware-efficient, noise-biased approaches to quantum error correction relative to qubit register encodings. Implementations have focused in particular on error correction of stored, idle quantum information, whereas quantum algorithms are likely to desire high duty cycles of active control. Error-transparent operations are one way to preserve error rates during operations, but, to the best of our knowledge, only phase gates have so far been given an explicitly error-transparent formulation for binomial encodings. Here, we introduce the concept of 'parity nested' operations, and show how these operations can be designed to achieve continuous amplitude-mixing logical gates for binomial encodings that are fully error-transparent to the photon loss channel. For a binomial encoding that protects against l photon losses, the construction requires $\lfloor$l/2$\rfloor$ + 1 orders of generalized squeezing in the parity nested operation to fully preserve this protection. We further show that error-transparency to all the correctable photon jumps, but not the no-jump errors, can be achieved with just a single order of squeezing. Finally, we comment on possible approaches to experimental realization of this concept.</description>

      <title>Control Flow Adaption: An Efficient Simulation Method For Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network research at both the software stack and hardware implementation level has become an exciting area of quantum information science. Although demonstrations of small-scale quantum networks have emerged in the past decade, quantum communication and computation hardware remain scarce resources today. As a result, the evaluation and validation of quantum network protocols primarily rely on classical simulators rather than real quantum networks. This paper introduces a novel quantum network simulation method called control flow adaptation, which enhances standard tensor network simulations. This method enables accurate and efficient simulations of many important quantum network protocols by carefully leveraging the control flow structures of them. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype quantum network simulator, qns-3, as a module for ns-3. This new module implements the control flow adaptation technique and applies it to a wide range of protocols. All related code is open-sourced. We believe the development of the control flow adaptation method and the qns-3 simulator represents a step forward in quantum network research, offering a versatile and scalable platform for testing and verifying quantum network protocols on classical computers.</description>

      <title>Operator formulation of Classical mechanics: Levi-Civita map and equivalence of central forces in 2-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator formulations of classical Kepler and harmonic oscillator problems in 2-dimensions are shown to be equivalent. We construct classical Hamiltonian operators and classical wavefunctions corresponding to these systems, using plane polar coordinates. The Schr\"{o}dinger like equation written in terms of these classical Hamiltonian operator and corresponding classical wavefunction describing former system are mapped to that of latter by Levi-Civita map and reparameterization of time(Sundman map).</description>

      <title>Boundaries of the sets of quantum realizable values of arbitrary order Bargmann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the latest developments within the field of quantum information science, Bargmann invariants have emerged as fundamental quantities, uniquely characterizing tuples of quantum states while remaining invariant under unitary transformations. However, determining the boundaries of quantum-realizable values for Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order remains a significant theoretical challenge. In this work, we completely solve this problem by deriving a unified boundary formulation for these values. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore the constraints imposed by quantum mechanics to delineate the achievable ranges of these invariants. We demonstrate that the boundaries depend on the specific properties of quantum states and the order of the Bargmann invariants, illustrated by a family of single-parameter qubit pure states. Our findings uncover intricate connections between Bargmann invariants and quantum imaginarity, offering a unified perspective on the associated boundary curves. These results enhance our understanding of the physical limits within quantum mechanics and may lead to novel applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems with momentum-dependent mass: Isochronicity and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Verification of single-photon path entanglement using a nitrogen vacancy center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path entanglement is an essential resource for photonic quantum information processing, including in quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification of bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a nitrogen-vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of measurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the presence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using continuous-wave laser excitation and a novel state generation 'time-window' method. This approach to path entanglement verification is different to previous work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of quantum-correlated pulse pairs in a dispersion modulated birefringent fiber is considered. The photon-number correlations and squeezing are studied using linearized quantum fluctuation theory. Two models of the pulse propagation in an optical fiber are used. The first model is based on the Manakov equations, and the second one is based on the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with differential group delay and birefringence terms. In the Manakov model the correlated pulse pairs can be generated using splitting of a second-order soliton and inelastic collision of two fundamental solitons. The interpulse correlations depends on the modulation period of the fiber dispersion. In the model of the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations the correlated pulse pair can be produced using pulse splitting due to polarization mode dispersion. The pulses have orthogonal polarization states. This allows the pulses to be separated into two different channels using a polarization beam splitter. The interpulse correlation depends on the interplay between polarization mode dispersion and polarization instability.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Local Hamiltonian Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local Hamiltonian Problems (LHPs) are important problems that are computationally QMA-complete and physically relevant for many-body quantum systems. Quantum MaxCut (QMC), which equates to finding ground states of the quantum Heisenberg model, is the canonical LHP for which various algorithms have been proposed, including semidefinite programs and variational quantum algorithms. We propose and analyze a quantum approximation algorithm which we call the Hamiltonian Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (HamQAOA), which builds on the well-known scheme for combinatorial optimization and is suitable for implementations on near-term hardware. We establish rigorous performance guarantees of the HamQAOA for QMC on high-girth regular graphs, and our result provides bounds on the ground energy density for quantum Heisenberg spin glasses in the infinite size limit that improve with depth. Furthermore, we develop heuristic strategies with which to efficiently obtain good HamQAOA parameters. Through numerical simulations, we show that the HamQAOA empirically outperforms prior algorithms on a wide variety of QMC instances. In particular, our results indicate that the linear-depth HamQAOA can deterministically prepare exact ground states of 1-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains described by the Bethe ansatz, in contrast to the exponential depths required in previous protocols for preparing Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Application of quantum annealing for scalable robotic assembly line optimization: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even distribution and optimization of tasks across resources and workstations is a critical process in manufacturing aimed at maximizing efficiency, productivity, and profitability, known as Robotic Assembly Line Balancing (RALB). With the increasing complexity of manufacturing required by mass customization, traditional computational approaches struggle to solve RALB problems efficiently. To address these scalability challenges, we investigate applying quantum computing, particularly quantum annealing, to the real-world based problem. We transform the integer programming formulation into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is then solved using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm on the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum computer. In a case study, the quantum solution is compared to an exact solution, demonstrating the potential for quantum computing to enhance manufacturing productivity and reduce costs. Nevertheless, limitations of quantum annealing, including hardware constraints and problem-specific challenges, suggest that continued advancements in quantum technology will be necessary to improve its applicability to RALB manufacturing optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Gaussian coherences of an oscillating atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence between energy eigenstates of harmonic oscillators is essential for quantum physics. Even the most elementary binary superpositions of the ground and the higher eigenstate are highly required for quantum sensing, thermodynamics, and computing. We derive upper bounds for quantum coherences achieved by classical and Gaussian states and operations and, subsequently, obtain a hierarchy of the thresholds for the off-diagonal elements necessary to reach genuine quantum non-Gaussian coherences. We experimentally demonstrate unambiguous observation of quantum non-Gaussian coherences in mechanical vibrations of a single calcium ion up to the superposition of zero and six phonons. The analysis of the robustness with respect to pure dephasing in a motional Ramsey experiment demonstrates the feasibility of their storage for up to more than 20 ms for superpositions with a large energy difference of participating number states. The presented observations prove that atomic oscillations go deeply into a diverse area of discrete quantum non-Gaussian coherent phenomena critical for their applications.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quantum correlation by cavity-mediated subradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super(sub)radiance in quantum systems arise from the interplay among quantum emitters. While bright superradiant states have been extensively studied and yielded significant insights into cooperative phenomena, subradiant states have remained less explored due to their inherently dark state nature. However, subradiance holds significant potential as valuable quantum resources that exploit long-lived and large-scale entanglement, which is a key for advancing quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived subradiant state among multiple quantum emitters coupled to a directional low Q cavity. In a tailored photonic environment with balanced cavity dissipation, emitter-field coupling strength, and incoherent pumping, two coupled quantum dots exhibit a steady-state population in a subradiant state with highly negative cooperativity. As an important hallmark of a subradiant state, the system shows large photon bunching (g^((2))(0)&gt;&gt;2) and suppressed single-photon decay. In addition, controlling the excitation wavelength provides a useful tool for manipulating dephasing and the number of coupled emitters, which leads to significant changes in photon statistics. Our approach to inducing cavity-mediated subradiance paves the way for creating and harnessing quantum correlations in quantum emitters via a long-lived entangled quantum state, essential for quantum storage and metrology.</description>

      <title>Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An Optical Interconnect for Modular Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much like classical supercomputers, scaling up quantum computers requires an optical interconnect. However, signal attenuation leads to irreversible qubit loss, making quantum interconnect design guidelines and metrics different from conventional computing. Inspired by the classical Dragonfly topology, we propose a multi-group structure where the group switch routes photons emitted by computational end nodes to the group's shared pool of Bell state analyzers (which conduct the entanglement swapping that creates end-to-end entanglement) or across a low-diameter path to another group. We present a full-stack analysis of system performance, a combination of distributed and centralized protocols, and a resource scheduler that plans qubit placement and communications for large-scale, fault-tolerant systems. We implement a prototype three-node switched interconnect and create two-hop entanglement with fidelities of at least 0.6. Our design emphasizes reducing network hops and optical components to simplify system stabilization while flexibly adjusting optical path lengths. Based on evaluated loss and infidelity budgets, we find that moderate-radix switches enable systems meeting expected near-term needs, and large systems are feasible. Our design is expected to be effective for a variety of quantum computing technologies, including ion traps and superconducting qubits with appropriate wavelength transduction.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflections are omnipresent tools in quantum algorithms. We consider the task of reflecting through the eigenspace of an implementable unitary. Such reflections are generally designed using phase estimation or linear combination of unitaries. These methods have size and depth that scale favorably with the desired precision and the spectral gap of the unitary. However, they require a number of ancilla qubits that grows with both parameters. Here, we present a simple algorithm with the same size and depth scaling but requiring only 3 ancilla qubits for all problem instances. As such, this algorithm is expected to become the reference method to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Cycle Benchmarking for high-accuracy error characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate noise characterization is essential for reliable quantum computation. Effective Pauli noise models have emerged as powerful tools, offering detailed description of the error processes with a manageable number of parameters, which guarantees the scalability of the characterization procedure. However, a fundamental limitation in the learnability of Pauli fidelities impedes full high-accuracy characterization of both general and effective Pauli noise, thereby restricting e.g., the performance of noise-aware error mitigation techniques. We introduce Multi-Layer Cycle Benchmarking (MLCB), an enhanced characterization protocol that improves the learnability associated with effective Pauli noise models by jointly analyzing multiple layers of Clifford gates. We show a simple experimental implementation and demonstrate that, in realistic scenarios, MLCB can reduce unlearnable noise degrees of freedom by up to $75\%$, improving the accuracy of sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise models and boosting the performance of error mitigation techniques like probabilistic error cancellation. Our results highlight MLCB as a scalable, practical tool for precise noise characterization and improved quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetries of quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates discovering new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries. Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same -- symmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a nonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent symmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved truncated propagator. We also study transport, showing that picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition trough different regimes: fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which there is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for achieving broadband complete reflection by constructing photonic bandgap via collective atom-atom interaction in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. Moreover, we propose several strategies to further expand the ultrahigh reflection windows, including increasing the number of atoms with separations near the Bragg distance and inducing gradient frequency modulation among the atoms. The center frequency and bandwidth of the ultrahigh reflection window are dynamically adjustable by applying external electromagnetic field. The results here can enrich the many-body physics of waveguide-QED system and offer a pathway for achieving broadened ultrahigh reflection in a controllable way, which can find important applications in the realms of chip-integrated band filter, quantum storage, optical switching, and wavelength-selective devices.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules by evaluating its performance in predicting excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many instances, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models that rely solely on classical features.</description>

      <title>Near-single-photon atto-watt detection at mid-infrared wavelengths by a room-temperature balanced heterodyne set-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon detection is the underpinning technology for quantum communication and quantum sensing applications. At visible and near-infrared wavelengths, single-photon-detectors (SPDs) underwent a significant development in the past two decades, with the commercialization of SPADs and superconducting detectors. At longer wavelengths, in the mid-infrared range (4-11$\mu$um), given the reduced scattering and favourable transparent atmospheric windows, there is an interest in developing quantum earth-satellites-links and quantum imaging for noisy environments or large-distance telescopes. Still, SPD-level mid-infrared devices have been rarely reported in the state-of-the-art (superconductors, single-electron-transistors or avalanche-photodiodes) and, crucially, all operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature detection system operating at 4.6$\mu$m-wavelength with a sensitivity-level of atto-watt optical power, corresponding to few tens of mid-infrared photons. This result was obtained by exploiting a pair of commercially available photodetectors within two balanced-heterodyne-detection setups: one involving a quantum-cascade-laser (QCL) and an acousto-optic-modulator (AOM) and the other one including two QCLs with mutual coherence ensured by a phase-lock-loop (PLL). Our work not only validates a viable method to detect ultra-low-intensity signals, but is also potentially scalable to the entire wavelength range already accessible by mature QCL technology, unfolding - for the first time - quantum applications at mid- and long-wave-infrared-radiation.</description>

      <title>Regression and Classification with Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since classical machine learning has become a powerful tool for developing data-driven algorithms, quantum machine learning is expected to similarly impact the development of quantum algorithms. The literature reflects a mutually beneficial relationship between machine learning and quantum computing, where progress in one field frequently drives improvements in the other. Motivated by the fertile connection between machine learning and quantum computing enabled by parameterized quantum circuits, we use a resource-efficient and scalable Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network (SQQNN) for both regression and classification tasks. The SQQNN leverages parameterized single-qubit unitary operators and quantum measurements to achieve efficient learning. To train the model, we use gradient descent for regression tasks. For classification, we introduce a novel training method inspired by the Taylor series, which can efficiently find a global minimum in a single step. This approach significantly accelerates training compared to iterative methods. Evaluated across various applications, the SQQNN exhibits virtually error-free and strong performance in regression and classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate the versatility, scalability, and suitability of the SQQNN for deployment on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Clifford Perturbation Approximation for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical for harnessing the potential of near-term quantum devices. Particularly, QEM protocols can be designed based on machine learning, where the mapping between noisy computational outputs and ideal ones can be learned on a training set consisting of Clifford circuits or near-Clifford circuits that contain only a limited number of non-Clifford gates. This learned mapping is then applied to noisy target circuits to estimate the ideal computational output. In this work, we propose a learning-based error mitigation framework called Clifford Perturbation Data Regression (CPDR), which constructs training sets by Clifford circuits with small perturbations. Specifically, these circuits are parameterized quantum circuits, where the rotation angles of the gates are restricted to a narrow range, ensuring that the gates remain close to Clifford gates. This design enables the efficient simulation of the training circuits using the Sparse Pauli Dynamics method. As a result, CPDR is able to utilize training sets with a better diversity to train the model, compared with previous learning-based QEM models that construct training sets with only Clifford or near-Clifford circuits. Numerical simulations on small-scale Ising model circuits demonstrate that the performance of CPDR dramatically outperforms that of existing methods such as Zero-Noise Extrapolation and learning-based Probabilistic Error Cancellation. Furthermore, using the experimental data from IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor, our findings suggest that CPDR demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the original mitigation results reported in [Nature 618, 500 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Experimental Machine Learning with Classical and Quantum Data via NMR Quantum Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. By numerically simulating the extended quantum kernel, we show classification of entangling and nonentangling unitaries. These results confirm that quantum kernels exhibit strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial shuttling results are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. The multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Through simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities for these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on these encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing maximally many-body entangled fermionic states by using $M$-body density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic Hamiltonians play a critical role in quantum chemistry, one of the most promising use cases for near-term quantum computers. However, since encoding nonlocal fermionic statistics using conventional qubits results in significant computational overhead, fermionic quantum hardware, such as fermion atom arrays, were proposed as a more efficient platform. In this context, we here study the many-body entanglement structure of fermionic $N$-particle states by concentrating on $M$-body reduced density matrices (DMs) across various bipartitions in Fock space. The von Neumann entropy of the reduced DM is a basis independent entanglement measure which generalizes the traditional quantum chemistry concept of the one-particle DM entanglement, which characterizes how a single fermion is entangled with the rest. We carefully examine upper bounds on the $M$-body entanglement, which are analogous to the volume law of conventional entanglement measures. To this end we establish a connection between $M$-body reduced DM and the mathematical structure of hypergraphs. Specifically, we show that a special class of hypergraphs, known as $t$-designs, corresponds to maximally entangled fermionic states. Finally, we explore fermionic many-body entanglement in random states. We semianalytically demonstrate that the distribution of reduced DMs associated with random fermionic states corresponds to the trace-fixed Wishart-Laguerre random matrix ensemble. In the limit of large single-particle dimension $D$ and a non-zero filling fraction, random states asymptotically become absolutely maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Engineering micromotion in Floquet prethermalization via space-time symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for Floquet prethermalization under strong resonant driving, emphasizing the pivotal role of dynamical space-time symmetries. Our approach demonstrates how dynamical space-time symmetries map onto the projective static symmetry group of the prethermal Hamiltonian governing the prethermal regime. We introduce techniques for detecting dynamical symmetries through the time evolution of local observables, facilitating a detailed analysis of micromotion within each period and surpassing the limitations of conventional stroboscopic Floquet prethermal dynamics. To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamical Phase Transition as a Complex Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum dynamical phase transition induced by the competition between local unitary evolution and dissipation in a qubit chain with a strong, on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. While the steady-state of this evolution is always maximally-mixed, we show that the dynamical behavior of certain non-local observables on the approach to this steady-state is dictated by a quantum Ising model with a $\textit{complex}$ transverse-field (cTFIM). We investigate these observables analytically, uncovering a dynamical phase transition as the relative rate of unitary evolution and dissipation is tuned. We show that the weak-dissipation limit corresponds to a cTFIM with a large magnitude of the imaginary transverse-field, for which the many-body "ground-state" (with smallest real eigenvalue) is gapless, exhibiting quasi-long-range correlations of the local magnetization with a continuously-varying exponent. Correspondingly, the dynamics of the non-local observables show oscillatory behavior with an amplitude decaying exponentially in time. The strong-dissipation limit corresponds to a gapped ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, and non-local observables show exponential decay on the approach to equilibrium. This transition in (1+1)-dimensions has a peculiar, "two-sided" nature appearing as either first- or second-order depending on the phase from which the transition is approached, an analytic result which is corroborated by numerical studies. In higher dimensions, we present a field-theoretic understanding of the first-order nature of this transition, when approaching from the ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, though the nature of the phase with large imaginary transverse-field remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecks in quantum channels and finite temperature phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analogue of the "bottleneck theorem", well-known for classical Markov chains, for Markovian quantum channels. In particular, we show that if two regions (subspaces) of Hilbert space are separated by a region that has very low weight in the channel's steady state, then states initialized on one side of this barrier will take a long time to relax, putting a lower bound on the mixing time in terms of an appropriately defined "quantum bottleneck ratio". Importantly, this bottleneck ratio involves not only the probabilities of the relevant subspaces, but also the size of off-diagonal matrix elements between them. For low-temperature quantum many-body systems, we use the bottleneck theorem to bound the performance of any quasi-local Gibbs sampler. This leads to a new perspective on thermally stable quantum phases in terms of a decomposition of the Gibbs state into multiple components separated by bottlenecks. As a concrete application, we show rigorously that weakly perturbed commuting projector models with extensive energy barriers (including certain classical and quantum expander codes) have exponentially large mixing times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <title>Metric as Emergence of Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Engineering of self-bending surface plasmon polaritons through Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons have received much attention over the last decades in fields such as photonics or nanotechnology due to their inherent high sensitivity to metal surface variations (e.g., presence of adsorbates or changes in the roughness). Because of this important property, it is expected that they will find promising major applications in widely cross-disciplinary areas ranging from material science to medicine. Motivated by this ever-growing interest, here we introduce a novel theoretical framework suitable to design new types of structured paraxial surface plasmon beams and to control their propagation along the interface between a dielectric and a lossy metal. This is possible by virtue of a convenient Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion, which constitutes a complete basis set upon which new types of structured paraxial plasmon beams can be generated. The beams obtained from this method present a rather peculiar feature, as they exhibit local intensity maxima at different propagation distances. This way of creating tightly confined structured light allows us control where to place the beam energy. This, thus, opens up worth exploring pathways to manipulate light propagation along metal surfaces at the nanoscale. As a proof-of-concept, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of the method by considering the analysis of the propagation of Airy-based surface plasmon polaritons along an air-silver interface.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual of Bures metric and subregion complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, computational complexity for reduced density matrices of holographic conformal field theories has been conjectured to be related to certain geometric observables in the dual gravity theory. We study this conjecture from both the gravity and field theory point of view. Specifically, we consider a measure of complexity associated to the Bures metric on the space of density matrices. We compute this complexity measure for mixed states associated to single intervals in descendant states of the vacuum in 2d CFTs. Moreover, we derive from first principles a geometric observable dual to the Bures metric which is localized in the entanglement wedge of the AdS spacetime associated to the quantum circuit on the boundary. Finally, we compare the Bures metric complexity measure with holographic subregion complexity within the ``complexity=volume'' paradigm for perturbatively small transformations of the vacuum. While there is no exact agreement between these two quantities, we find striking similarities as we vary the target state and interval size, suggesting that these quantities are closely related.</description>

      <title>Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining a hierarchy of rigorous bounds on the time-evolution of a quantum mechanical system from an arbitrary initial state, systematically generalizing Mandelstam-Tamm-like relations. For any fixed level in the hierarchy, the bounds are tightest after short time-evolution and gradually loosen over time; we present evidence that for any fixed amount of time-evolution, the bounds can be made arbitrarily tight by moving up in the hierarchy. The computational effort to obtain the bounds scales polynomially with the number of degrees of freedom in the system being simulated. We demonstrate the method on both a single anharmonic oscillator and a system of two coupled anharmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of Tan's contact in a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tan contact has emerged as a pivotal quantity in characterizing many-body quantum systems, bridging microscopic short-range correlations to thermodynamic behavior. It is defined as the weight of universal $1/k^4$ fall off in momentum distribution tails, which can be measured directly in ultracold gases. So far, however, its direct measurement has been hindered in Bose gases due to interactions strongly affecting the expansion dynamics. Here, we present the first direct measurement of the Tan contact in a strongly-correlated Lieb-Liniger gas. Leveraging the one-dimensional geometry of our system, we implement a two-stage expansion scheme, yielding interaction-immune time-of-flight imaging. Our results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions from quantum Monte Carlo calculations, which also provides independent thermometry of the experiment. By varying atom number, temperature, and interaction strength, we obtain results consistent with the universal scaling law predicted for the trapped Lieb-Liniger model. Our work paves the way for further characterization of the Lieb-Liniger gas across broad interaction regimes and holds promise for extension to other correlated quantum gases in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Cluster Decomposition for Improved Erasure Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new erasure decoder that applies to arbitrary quantum LDPC codes. Dubbed the cluster decoder, it generalizes the decomposition idea of Vertical-Horizontal (VH) decoding introduced by Connelly et al. in 2022. Like the VH decoder, the idea is to first run the peeling decoder and then post-process the resulting stopping set. The cluster decoder breaks the stopping set into a tree of clusters which can be solved sequentially via Gaussian Elimination (GE). By allowing clusters of unconstrained size, this decoder achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with reduced complexity compared with full GE. When GE is applied only to clusters whose sizes are less than a constant, the performance is degraded but the complexity becomes linear in the block length. Our simulation results show that, for hypergraph product codes, the cluster decoder with constant cluster size achieves near-ML performance similar to VH decoding in the low-erasure-rate regime. For the general quantum LDPC codes we studied, the cluster decoder can be used to estimate the ML performance curve with reduced complexity over a wide range of erasure rates.</description>

      <title>Exact Valence-Bond Solid Scars in the Square-Lattice Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spin-s square-lattice Heisenberg model has exact many-body scars. These scars are simple valence-bond solids with exactly zero energy, and they exist in even-by-even systems and ladders of width 2. Ladders have additional scars corresponding to injecting one or two magnons on top of a parent valence-bond solid scar. These scars have a remarkably simple physical origin based only the angular momentum algebra and cancellations from spin-antialignment within a valence bond. Our comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations suggest that our valence-bond solids exhaust all exact eigenstates in the Heisenberg model except for few-magnon states near the top of the spectrum. Our scars are interesting because they are not part of a tower, have area-law entanglement, break translation symmetry, and exist for Heisenberg models of all spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have revolutionized various fields of quantum science over the past three decades, with notable applications such as gravitational wave detection. Here, we extend the use of squeezed light to the realm of ultrafast quantum science. We demonstrate the generation of ultrafast, broadband quantum light pulses spanning 0.33 to 0.73 PHz using light field synthesizer and a four-wave mixing nonlinear process. Experimental results confirm that these pulses exhibit amplitude squeezing, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. This work lays the groundwork for a new field of ultrafast quantum science, enabling real-time studies of quantum light-matter interaction dynamics, which expect to reveal new physics. We also demonstrate the encoding of binary digital data onto these quantum light waveforms, synthesized with attosecond resolution, showcasing potential applications in secure quantum communication. This work paves the way for ultrafast quantum optoelectronics, quantum computing, and next-generation encrypted quantum communication networks, capable of achieving petahertz-scale data transmission speeds.</description>

      <title>The generalized CV conjecture of Krylov complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the ``complexity=volume" (CV) conjecture in the wormhole to the quantum states in the framework of information geometry. In particular, we conjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric in the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the general Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in the closed and open systems. By employing the displacement operator, we find that the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known two-mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function known as the open two-mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume of the corresponding Fubini-Study metric provides strong evidence for the validity of the generalized CV conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</description>

Abstract: The frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for the Schwartzschild black hole are studied from the viewpoint of the particle scattering under an effective Regge-Wheeler type of potential consisting of a parabolic type one in an intermediate region and flat potentials on both sides. In particular, we use the eigenstates for a reversed harmonic oscillator as the complete bases in this intermediate region.

      <title>From spontaneous to explicit symmetry breaking in a finite-sized system: Bosonic bound states of an impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a single attractive impurity in an ultracold repulsive bosonic system can drive a transition from a homogeneous to a localized state, as we here show for a one-dimensional ring system. In the few-body limit the localization of the bosons around the impurity, as seen in the pair correlations, is accompanied by low-lying modes that resemble finite-size precursors of Higgs-Anderson and Nambu-Goldstone-like modes. Tuning the impurity-boson mass ratio allows for the exploration of the transition from a spontaneous to an explicit breaking of the continuous rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We compare the minimum of the Higgs-Anderson-like mode as a marker of the onset of localization in the few-body limit to mean-field predictions of binding. We find improved agreement between the few-body exact diagonalization results and mean-field predictions of binding with increasing boson-boson repulsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can realize novel phases of matter that are not present in time-independent Hamiltonians. One important application is the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which opens the realm of topological many-body physics to neutral atom quantum simulators. In this work, we leverage a neutral atom quantum simulator to experimentally realize the strongly-interacting Mott-Meissner phase in large-scale, bosonic flux ladders with 48 sites at half filling. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of the interacting Mott-Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large, strongly correlated phases, paving the way for exploring topological quantum matter with single-atom resolution and control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in 1D displaying $SO(2,1)$ hidden symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally-relevant drive protocols spanning both quasi-static and non-adiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground state echo amplitude and closely related ground state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>A healthier semi-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of quantum systems onto classical ones. Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we numerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of vacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe. Finally, we discuss the application of these results to semi-classical gravity, and the black-hole information problem.</description>

      <title>Theory-independent randomness generation from spatial symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize how the response of physical systems to spatial rotations constrains the probabilities of events that may be observed. From a foundational point of view, we show that the set of quantum correlations in our scenarios can be derived from rotational symmetry alone, without assuming quantum physics. This shows that important predictions of quantum theory can be derived from the structure of space, demonstrating that semi-device-independent scenarios can be utilized to shed light on the foundations of physics. From a practical perspective, these results allow us to introduce semi-device-independent protocols for the generation of secure random numbers based on the breaking of spatial symmetries. While experimental implementations will rely on quantum physics, the security analysis and the amount of extracted randomness is theory-independent and certified by the observed correlations only. That is, our protocols rely on a physically meaningful assumption: a bound on a theory-independent notion of spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze quantum measurement and entanglement by solving the dynamics of stochastic amplitudes that propagate both forward and backward in time. The model allows simulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell correlations, and reveals consistency with a weak form of local realism defined after the unitary interactions determining the measurement settings. Bell violations emerge due to a breakdown of a subset of Bell's local-realism conditions. Our results elucidate how hidden causal loops can explain Bell nonlocality, without requiring retrocausality at a macroscopic level.</description>

      <title>Certifying bipartite pure quantum states efficiently using untrusted devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that all bipartite pure quantum states can be certified by quantum self-testing, i.e., any such states can be pinned down completely based on the statistics produced by local quantum measurements. A notable feature of quantum self-testing is that the conclusions remain reliable even when the quantum measurements involved are untrusted, where quantum nonlocality is crucial. This necessitates that each party conducts at least two different quantum measurements to produce the desired correlation. Here, we prove that when the underlying Hilbert space dimension is known beforehand, which is very common in quantum experiments, an arbitrary $d\times d$ bipartite pure state can be certified completely (up to local unitaries) by a certain correlation generated with a single measurement setting on each party, where each measurement yields only $2d$ or even $d+1$ outcomes. We also prove the robustness of our protocols to quantum noises and experimental imperfections. Compared with quantum self-testing, our protocols do not hinge on quantum nonlocality and are much more efficient, yet they maintain the essential feature of not requiring additional assumptions about the quantum devices involved. This advancement could offer significant convenience when certifying bipartite quantum states using untrusted quantum devices in future quantum industries.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Importance of Non-Shortest Paths in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they ``superpose'' parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) provides unconditional security; however, its practical implementations are susceptible to exploitable vulnerabilities. This investigation tackles the constraints in practical QKD implementations using weak coherent pulses. We improve on the conventional approach of using decoy pulses by integrating it with the coincidence detection (CD) protocol. Additionally, we introduce an easy-to-implement algorithm to compute asymptotic key rates for the protocol. Furthermore, we have carried out an experimental implementation of the protocol, where we demonstrate that monitoring coincidences in the decoy state protocol leads to enhanced key rates under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic systems with negative Wigner function superposition states are fundamentally witnessing nonlinear quantum dynamics beyond linearized systems and, recently, have become essential resources of quantum technology with many applications. Typically, they appear due to sophisticated combination of external drives, nonlinear control, measurements or strong nonlinear dissipation of subsystems to an environment. Here, we propose a conceptually different and more autonomous way to obtain such states, avoiding these ingredients, using purely sudden interaction decay in the paradigmatic interacting qubit-oscillator system weakly coupled to bath at thermal equilibrium in a low-temperature limit. We demonstrate simultaneously detectable unconditional negative Wigner function and quantum coherence and their qualitative enhancement employing more qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamically corrected gates in silicon singlet-triplet spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires low physical-qubit gate errors. Many approaches exist to reduce gate errors, including both hardware- and control-optimization strategies. Dynamically corrected gates are designed to cancel specific errors and offer the potential for high-fidelity gates, but they have yet to be implemented in singlet-triplet spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, due in part to the stringent control constraints in these systems. In this work, we experimentally implement dynamically corrected gates designed to mitigate hyperfine noise in a singlet-triplet qubit realized in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot. The corrected gates reduce infidelities by about a factor of three, resulting in gate fidelities above 0.99 for both identity and Hadamard gates. The gate performances depend sensitively on pulse distortions, and their specific performance reveals an unexpected distortion in our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for enhancing the robustness of light-pulse atom interferometers against the pulse infidelities that typically limit their sensitivities. The technique uses quantum optimal control to favorably harness the multipath interference of the stray trajectories produced by imperfect atom-optics operations. We apply this method to a resonant atom interferometer and achieve thousand-fold phase amplification, representing a fifty-fold improvement over the performance observed without optimized control. Moreover, we find that spurious interference can arise from the interplay of spontaneous emission and many-pulse sequences and demonstrate optimization strategies to mitigate this effect. Given the ubiquity of spontaneous emission in quantum systems, these results may be valuable for improving the performance of a diverse array of quantum sensors. We anticipate our findings will significantly benefit the performance of matter-wave interferometers for a variety of applications, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Charge and Flux Noise from Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Energy Distributions in Superconducting Qubits and Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude larger than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we propose an additional loss mechanism arising from nonequilibrium quasiparticle densities: Ohmic loss due to quasiparticles residing in superconducting wires away from the junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in quasiequilibrium [T. Connolly et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 217001 (2024)] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We show that the resulting contribution to qubit and resonator energy relaxation rate $1/T_1$ can be larger than the one due to amorphous two-level systems and comparable to the contribution from quasipaticle-tunneling. We also discuss the flux noise associated to charge noise fluctuations. For quasiparticles in quasiequilibrium the associated flux noise is logarithmic-in-frequency, giving rise to a "nearly white" contribution that is comparable to the flux noise observed in experiments. This contrasts to amorphous two-level systems, whose associated flux noise is shown to be superOhmic. In conclusion, wire-resident quasiparticles are a universal source of loss and decoherence even when the quasiparticles are far away from Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum processing units (QPUs) are highly heterogeneous in terms of physical qubit performance. To add even more complexity, drift in quantum noise landscapes has been well-documented. This makes resource allocation a challenging problem whenever a quantum program must be mapped to hardware. As a solution, we propose a novel resource allocation framework that applies Pauli checks. Pauli checks have demonstrated their efficacy at error mitigation in prior work, and in this paper, we highlight their potential to infer the noise characteristics of a quantum system. Circuits with embedded Pauli checks can be executed on different regions of qubits, and the syndrome data created by error-detecting Pauli checks can be leveraged to guide quantum program outcomes toward regions that produce higher-fidelity final distributions. Using noisy simulation and a real QPU testbed, we show that dynamic quantum resource allocation with Pauli checks can outperform state-of-art mapping techniques, such as those that are noise-aware. Further, when applied toward the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, techniques guided by Pauli checks demonstrate the ability to increase circuit fidelity 11% on average, and up to 33%.</description>

      <title>Learning $k$-body Hamiltonians via compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $k$-body Hamiltonian with $M$ unknown Pauli terms that are not necessarily geometrically local. We propose a protocol that learns the Hamiltonian to precision $\epsilon$ with total evolution time ${\mathcal{O}}(M^{1/2+1/p}/\epsilon)$ up to logarithmic factors, where the error is quantified by the $\ell^p$-distance between Pauli coefficients. Our learning protocol uses only single-qubit control operations and a GHZ state initial state, is non-adaptive, is robust against SPAM errors, and performs well even if $M$ and $k$ are not precisely known in advance or if the Hamiltonian is not exactly $M$-sparse. Methods from the classical theory of compressed sensing are used for efficiently identifying the $M$ terms in the Hamiltonian from among all possible $k$-body Pauli operators. We also provide a lower bound on the total evolution time needed in this learning task, and we discuss the operational interpretations of the $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ error metrics. In contrast to most previous works, our learning protocol requires neither geometric locality nor any other relaxed locality conditions.</description>

      <title>EQB: Synthesizing Permutative Quantum Gates and Circuits Using Rotation-Based Group Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition from the group theory-based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov is extended to design binary quantum cascades, using the quantum rotational gates by the X-axis (CNOT and RX), Y-axis (RY), and Z-axis (controlled-Z) of the Bloch sphere. A class of local transformations is also presented to simplify the final canonical cascade circuits. Our proposed methodology is well suited for quantum layouts, as each single-qubit gate has one target qubit and each double-qubit gate has one control qubit and one target qubit, thereby never creating a graph of triangular connectivity.</description>

      <title>Narrow optical linewidths in stoichiometric layered rare-earth crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth emitters in solids are well-suited for implementing efficient, long-lived quantum memory coupled to integrated photonics for scalable quantum technologies. They are typically introduced as dopants in a solid-state host, but this introduces disorder and limits the available density of emitters. Stoichiometric materials can offer high densities with narrow optical linewidths. The regular spacing of emitters also opens possibilities for quantum information processing and collective effects. Here we show narrow optical linewidths in a layered stoichiometric crystalline material, NaEu(IO$_3$)$_4$. We observed an inhomogeneous linewidth of 2.2(1) GHz and a homogeneous linewidth of 120(4) kHz. Using spectral hole-burning techniques, we observe a hyperfine spin lifetime of 1.9(4) s. Furthermore, we demonstrate an atomic frequency comb delay of up to 800 ns.</description>

      <title>Slow Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing thermal (Gibbs) states is a common task in physics and computer science. Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the cost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like algorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum systems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising model and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization of these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in quantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous to the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and quantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.
  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the mixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low temperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers also have $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n^\alpha)]$. This applies to models like random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we provide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[\Omega(n)]$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low constant temperature. Finally, we consider constant-degree classical Hamiltonians and show how to lift classical slow mixing results in the presence of a transverse field using Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques. We show generic results for models with linear free energy barriers, and we demonstrate that our techniques extend to models with sublinear free energy barriers by proving $T_\mathrm{mix} = \exp[n^{1/2-o(1)}]$ for the ferromagnetic 2D transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>The transfer of nonlocality between two- and three-qubit dissipative systems with counter-rotating-wave terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of counter-rotating-wave terms on nonlocality and entanglement for three qubits coupled with a common bath for strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes beyond the traditional treatment of Born-Markovian, perturbative and rotating wave approximations by employing the numerical hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings are as follows: (i) In the strong coupling regime, the counter-rotating terms accelerate the decay of genuine three-party correlations, and the obvious sudden birth of BN is found; (ii) In the ultrastrong coupling regime, we observe a novel phenomenon where nonlocality is consistently transferred between a three-qubit and its subsystem. Besides, the inclusion of counter-rotating wave terms obviously enhances genuine tripartite nonlocality; and (iii) These counter-rotating terms cannot effectively generate genuine three-party correlations in zero-excitation cases, which differs from previous studies involving only two qubits.</description>

      <title>Sequential Attack Impairs Security in Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) leverages nonlocal correlations to securely establish cryptographic keys between two honest parties while making minimal assumptions about the underlying systems. The security of DI-QKD relies on the validation of quantum theory, with Bell violations ensuring the inherent unpredictability of the observed statistics, independent of the trustworthiness of the devices. While traditional QKD attacks are generally categorised as individual, collective, or coherent attacks, we introduce a novel attack strategy-the sequential attack. In this approach, Eve intercepts the transmitted quantum particle, performs an unsharp measurement to preserve the Bell violation between the honest parties, and disguises her interference as noise. Such a strategy enables Eve to extract substantial information about the key, even without performing collective measurements. Furthermore, when combined with collective attack, this strategy significantly reduces the secure key rate and, under certain conditions, can render it to zero. We show that within specific ranges of Bell violations and quantum bit error rates, the cumulative effect of sequential and collective attacks poses a stronger threat to DI-QKD security than collective attacks alone. These findings underscore the vulnerability of DI-QKD to real-world imperfections, emphasising that Bell nonlocality alone is insufficient to guarantee security in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical systems with nonlinear interactions: photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady progress of quantum hardware is motivating the search for novel quantum algorithm optimization strategies for near-term, real-world applications. In this study, we propose a novel feature map optimization strategy for Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), designed to enhance binary classification while taking into account backend-specific parameters, including qubit connectivity, native gate sets, and circuit depth, which are critical factors in noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The dataset we utilised belongs to the neutrino physics domain, with applications in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. A key contribution of this work is the parallelization of the classification task to commercially available superconducting quantum hardware to speed up the genetic search processes. The study was carried out by partitioning each quantum processing unit (QPU) into several sub-units with the same topology to implement individual QSVM instances. We conducted parallelization experiments with three IBM backends with more than 100 qubits, ranking the sub-units based on their susceptibility to noise. Data-driven simulations show how, under certain restrictions, parallelized genetic optimization can occur with the tested devices when retaining the top 20% ranked sub-units in the QPU.</description>

Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy in Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of an observer-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum level by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy formula to incorporate contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We demonstrate this framework by computing the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved spaces. Our work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to study quantum information in continuous and curved sample spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced super-resolution imaging techniques require specific approaches for accurate and consistent estimation of the achievable spatial resolution. Fisher information supplied to Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has proved to be a powerful and efficient tool for resolution analysis and optical setups optimization. However, the standard CRB is not applicable to constrained problems violating the unbiasedness condition, while such models are frequently encountered in quantum imaging of complex objects. Complimentary to the existing approaches based on modifying CRB, we propose a practical algorithm for approximate construction of a modified Fisher information matrix, which takes the constraints into account and can be supplied to the standard CRB. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique by applying it to 1-, 2-, and multi-parameter model problems in quantum imaging. The approach provides quantitative explanation of previous results with successful experimental reconstruction of objects with the spatial scale smaller than the theoretical limit predicted by the standard CRB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are excellent qubits due to their long coherence times, scalability, and compatibility with advanced semiconductor technology. Although high gate fidelities can be achieved with spin qubits, charge noise in the semiconductor environment still hinders further improvements. Despite the importance of charge noise, key questions about the specific nature of the fluctuators that cause charge noise remain unanswered. Here, we probe individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots through simple quantum-dot transport measurements and analyses based on the Allan variance and factorial hidden Markov modeling. We find that the TLF switching times depend sensitively on gate voltages, decrease with temperature, and depend on the current through a nearby quantum dot. A model for the data of the primary TLF we study indicates that it may be a bistable charge dipole near the plunger gate electrode, heated by current through the sensor dot, and experiencing state transitions driven not by direct electron-phonon coupling but through some other mechanism such as coupling to electrons passing through the sensor dot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm \pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metal in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum phenomena, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>

Abstract: We study the internal dynamics of a hypothetical spaceship traveling on a close timelike curve in an axially symmetric universe. We choose the curve so that the generator of evolution in proper time is the angular momentum. Using Wigner's theorem, we prove that the energy levels internal to the spaceship must undergo spontaneous discretization. The level separation turns out to be finely tuned so that, after completing a roundtrip of the curve, all systems are back to their initial state. This implies, for example, that the memories of an observer inside the spaceship are necessarily erased by the end of the journey. More in general, if there is an increase in entropy, a Poincar\'{e} cycle will eventually reverse it by the end of the loop, forcing entropy to decrease back to its initial value. We show that such decrease in entropy is in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The non-existence of time-travel paradoxes follows as a rigorous corollary of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials</title>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Tailoring coherent charge transport in graphene by deterministic defect generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04858</link>

Abstract: Harnessing the wave-nature of charge carriers in solid state devices, electron optics investigates and exploits coherent phenomena, in analogy with optics and photonics. Typically, this requires complex electronic devices leveraging macroscopically coherent charge transport in two-dimensional electron gases and superconductors. Here, collective coherent effects are induced in a simple counterintuitive architecture by defect engineering. Deterministically introduced lattice defects in graphene enable the phase coherent charge transport by playing the role of potential barriers, instead of scattering centres as conventionally considered. Thus, graphene preserves its quasi-ballistic quantum transport and can support phase-matched charge carrier waves. Based on this approach, multiple electronic Fabry-P\`erot cavities are formed by creating periodically alternating defective and pristine nano-stripes through low energy electron-beam irradiation. Indeed, defective stripes behave as partially reflecting mirrors and resonantly confine the charge carrier waves within the pristine areas, giving rise to Fabry-P\`erot resonant modes. These modes experimentally manifest as sheet resistance oscillations, as also confirmed by Landauer-B\"uttiker simulations. Moreover, these coherent phenomena survive up to 30 K for both polarities of charge carriers, contrarily to traditional monopolar electrostatically created Fabry-P\`erot interferometers. Our study positions defective graphene as an innovative platform for coherent electronic devices, with potential applications in nano and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum inspired factorization up to 100-bit RSA number in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical public-key cryptography standards rely on the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption protocol. The security of this protocol is based on the exponential computational complexity of the most efficient classical algorithms for factoring large semiprime numbers into their two prime components. Here, we attack RSA factorization building on Schnorr's mathematical framework where factorization translates into a combinatorial optimization problem. We solve the optimization task via tensor network methods, a quantum-inspired classical numerical technique. This tensor network Schnorr's sieving algorithm displays numerical evidence of a polynomial scaling of the resources with the bit-length of the semiprime. We factorize RSA numbers up to 100 bits encoding the optimization problem in quantum systems with up to 256 qubits. Only the high-order polynomial scaling of the required resources limits the factorization of larger numbers. Although these results do not currently undermine the security of the present communication infrastructure, they strongly highlight the urgency of implementing post-quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a central role in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Moreover, hBN hosts room-temperature quantum emitters and optically addressable spins, making it promising for quantum sensing and quantum photonics. Despite many investigations of their optical properties, however, the emitters' chemical structure remains unclear, as does the role of contamination at surfaces and interfaces in forming the emitters or modifying their properties. We prepare hBN samples that are compatible with confocal photoluminescence (PL) microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and we use those techniques to quantitatively investigate correlations between fluorescent emission, flake morphology, and surface residue. We find that the microscopy techniques themselves induce changes in hBN's optical activity and residue morphology: PL measurements induce photobleaching, whereas TEM measurements alter surface residue and emission characteristics. We also study the effects of common treatments $\unicode{x2014}$ annealing and oxygen plasma cleaning $\unicode{x2014}$ on the structure and optical activity of hBN. The methods can be broadly applied to study two-dimensional materials, and the results illustrate the importance of correlative studies to elucidate structural factors that influence hBN's functionality as a host for quantum emitters and spin defects.</description>

      <title>Orbital Optical Raman Lattice</title>

Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of entanglement from crosscap states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>
