      <title>Sound training platform applied to astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence between astronomy and data sonification represents a significant advancement in the approach and analysis of cosmic information. By surpassing the visual exclusivity in data analysis in astronomy, innovative projects have developed software that goes beyond visual representation, transforming data into auditory and tactile displays. However, it has been evidenced that this novel technique requires specialized training, particularly for audio format data. This work describes the initial development of a platform aimed at providing training for data analysis in astronomy through sonification. The integration of these tools in astronomical education and research opens new horizons, facilitating a more inclusive and multisensory participation in the exploration of space science.</description>

      <title>Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{&lt;endoftext&gt;}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{&lt;endoftext&gt;}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</description>

      <title>Lost in Transcription: Identifying and Quantifying the Accuracy Biases of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems Against Disfluent Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, increasingly prevalent in education, healthcare, employment, and mobile technology, face significant challenges in inclusivity, particularly for the 80 million-strong global community of people who stutter. These systems often fail to accurately interpret speech patterns deviating from typical fluency, leading to critical usability issues and misinterpretations. This study evaluates six leading ASRs, analyzing their performance on both a real-world dataset of speech samples from individuals who stutter and a synthetic dataset derived from the widely-used LibriSpeech benchmark. The synthetic dataset, uniquely designed to incorporate various stuttering events, enables an in-depth analysis of each ASR's handling of disfluent speech. Our comprehensive assessment includes metrics such as word error rate (WER), character error rate (CER), and semantic accuracy of the transcripts. The results reveal a consistent and statistically significant accuracy bias across all ASRs against disfluent speech, manifesting in significant syntactical and semantic inaccuracies in transcriptions. These findings highlight a critical gap in current ASR technologies, underscoring the need for effective bias mitigation strategies. Addressing this bias is imperative not only to improve the technology's usability for people who stutter but also to ensure their equitable and inclusive participation in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Look Once to Hear: Target Speech Hearing with Noisy Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In crowded settings, the human brain can focus on speech from a target speaker, given prior knowledge of how they sound. We introduce a novel intelligent hearable system that achieves this capability, enabling target speech hearing to ignore all interfering speech and noise, but the target speaker. A naive approach is to require a clean speech example to enroll the target speaker. This is however not well aligned with the hearable application domain since obtaining a clean example is challenging in real world scenarios, creating a unique user interface problem. We present the first enrollment interface where the wearer looks at the target speaker for a few seconds to capture a single, short, highly noisy, binaural example of the target speaker. This noisy example is used for enrollment and subsequent speech extraction in the presence of interfering speakers and noise. Our system achieves a signal quality improvement of 7.01 dB using less than 5 seconds of noisy enrollment audio and can process 8 ms of audio chunks in 6.24 ms on an embedded CPU. Our user studies demonstrate generalization to real-world static and mobile speakers in previously unseen indoor and outdoor multipath environments. Finally, our enrollment interface for noisy examples does not cause performance degradation compared to clean examples, while being convenient and user-friendly. Taking a step back, this paper takes an important step towards enhancing the human auditory perception with artificial intelligence.

      <title>An Investigation of Incorporating Mamba for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to study a scalable state-space model (SSM), Mamba, for the speech enhancement (SE) task. We exploit a Mamba-based regression model to characterize speech signals and build an SE system upon Mamba, termed SEMamba. We explore the properties of Mamba by integrating it as the core model in both basic and advanced SE systems, along with utilizing signal-level distances as well as metric-oriented loss functions. SEMamba demonstrates promising results and attains a PESQ score of 3.55 on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset. When combined with the perceptual contrast stretching technique, the proposed SEMamba yields a new state-of-the-art PESQ score of 3.69.</description>

      <title>WavCraft: Audio Editing and Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce WavCraft, a collective system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to connect diverse task-specific models for audio content creation and editing. Specifically, WavCraft describes the content of raw audio materials in natural language and prompts the LLM conditioned on audio descriptions and user requests. WavCraft leverages the in-context learning ability of the LLM to decomposes users' instructions into several tasks and tackle each task collaboratively with the particular module. Through task decomposition along with a set of task-specific models, WavCraft follows the input instruction to create or edit audio content with more details and rationales, facilitating user control. In addition, WavCraft is able to cooperate with users via dialogue interaction and even produce the audio content without explicit user commands. Experiments demonstrate that WavCraft yields a better performance than existing methods, especially when adjusting the local regions of audio clips. Moreover, WavCraft can follow complex instructions to edit and create audio content on the top of input recordings, facilitating audio producers in a broader range of applications. Our implementation and demos are available at this https://github.com/JinhuaLiang/WavCraft.</description>
