      <title>An Algorithm to compute the Kronecker cone and other moment cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm that computes the minimal list of inequalities for the moment cone of any representation of a complex reductive group. We give more details for the Kronecker cone (that is the asymptotic support of the Kronecker coefficients) and the fermionic cone. These two cases correspond to the action of $GL_{d_1}(\mathbb C)\times\cdots\times GL_{d_s}(\mathbb C)$ on $\mathbb C^{d_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbb C^{d_s}$ and $GL_d(\mathbb C)$ on $\bigwedge^r\mathbb C^d$, respectively. These two cases are implemented in Python-Sage. Available at https://ea-icj.github.io/, our algorithm improves in several directions, the one given by Vergne-Walter in Inequalities for Moment Cones of Finite-Dimensional Representations. For example, it can compute the minimal list of 463 inequalities for the Kronecker cone $(5,5,5)$ in 20 minutes. An important ingredient is an algorithm that decides whether an application is birational or not. It could be of independent interest in effective algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Realizations of homology classes and projection areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-$F^e$-split and quasi-$F$-regular singularities, which generalize Yobuko's quasi-$F$-splitting. We establish Fedder type criteria that characterize these properties for hypersurfaces. These criteria offer explicit tools for computation and verification. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the inversion of adjunction for quasi-$F$-regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove compatibility relations between mixed Hodge numbers of $k$-Du Bois fibers in flat projective families and versal deformations of isolated $k$-Du Bois singularities. These extend the notion of polarized relations in asymptotic Hodge theory beyond the normal-crossing boundary case, and we study combinatorial properties of the resulting weak polarized relations graphs.</description>

      <title>Quartic curves in the quintic del Pezzo threefold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the Hilbert scheme $\mathbf{H}_4(X_5)$ of rational quartic curves on the quintic del Pezzo threefold $X_5$ is isomorphic to a Grassmannian bundle over the Hilbert scheme of lines on $X_5$. In particular, $\mathbf{H}_4(X_5)$ is smooth and irreducible. Our approach builds upon the geometry of rational quartic curves on $X_5$ studied by Fanelli-Gruson-Perrin in their work on the moduli space of stable maps to $X_5$.</description>

      <title>The Segre Determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segre determinant is a polynomial which encodes the condition for points to lie on a bilinear hypersurface in the product of projective spaces. We study Segre determinants and compute them in various coordinate systems. We show that the Segre determinant represents the Chow-Lam form of a generic torus orbit in the Grassmannian. These Chow-Lam forms were introduced as a generalization of Chow forms for projective varieties, and enjoy many similar properties. We also present applications to algebraic vision and to Chow quotients of Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Quasi-modular forms for the orthogonal group and Gromov-Witten theory of Enriques surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of almost-holomorphic and quasimodular forms for orthogonal groups of a lattice of signature $(2,n)$ through orthogonal lowering and raising operators. The interactions with the regularized theta lift of Borcherds is a central theme. Our main results are: (i) the constant-term morphism, which sends an almost-holomorphic modular form to its associated quasimodular form, is an isomorphism, (ii) description of spaces of quasimodular forms in terms of vector-valued modular forms, (iii) the lowering and raising operators satisfy equivariance properties with the theta lift, (iv) a weight-depth inequality which is a necessary and sufficient criterion for the theta lift of an almost-holomorphic modular form to be almost-holomorphic, (v) an explicit formula for the series expansion of the lift of any almost-holomorphic modular form, (vi) the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of an orthogonal quasimodular form are quasi-Jacobi forms.
  As a geometric application, we conjecture that the Gromov-Witten potentials of Enriques and bielliptic surfaces are orthogonal quasimodular forms and satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations with respect to the lowering operators on quasimodular forms. We show that parallel statements for an arbitrary K3 or abelian-surface fibration do not hold.</description>

      <title>Valuative independence and cluster theta reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that theta functions constructed from positive scattering diagrams satisfy valuative independence. That is, for certain valuations $\operatorname{val}_{v}$, we have $\operatorname{val}_v(\sum_u c_u \vartheta_u)=\min_{c_u\neq 0} \operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)$. As applications, we prove linear independence of theta functions with specialized coefficients and characterize when theta functions for cluster varieties are unchanged by the unfreezing of an index. This yields a general gluing result for theta functions from moduli of local systems on marked surfaces. We then prove that theta functions for cluster varieties satisfy a symmetry property called theta reciprocity: briefly, $\operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)=\operatorname{val}_u(\vartheta_v)$. For this we utilize a new framework called a "seed datum" for understanding cluster-type varieties. One may apply valuative independence and theta reciprocity together to identify theta function bases for global sections of line bundles on partial compactifications of cluster varieties.</description>

      <title>The modular automorphisms of quotient modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the modular automorphism group of any quotient modular curve of level $N$, with $4,9\nmid N$. In particular, we obtain some non-expected automorphisms of order 3 that appear for the quotient modular curves when the Atkin-Lehner involution $w_{25}$ belongs to the quotient modular group, such automorphisms are not necessarily defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. As a consequence of the results, we obtain the full automorphism group of the quotient modular curve $X_0^*(N^2)$, for sufficiently large $N$.</description>

Abstract: We study the basic locus of Shimura varieties associated to the group of spinor similitudes of a quadratic space over $\mathbb{Q}$ with level structure given by the stabilizer of a vertex lattice. We give a description of the underlying reduced scheme of the associated Rapoport--Zink space, generalizing results of Howard--Pappas [HP17] and Oki [Oki20b], in the case of self-dual, and almost self dual level structure.</description>

      <title>Representable tangent structures for affine schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The category of affine schemes is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by K\"ahler differentials, providing a direct link between algebraic geometry and tangent category theory. Moreover, this tangent bundle functor is represented by the ring of dual numbers. How special is this tangent structure? Is there any other (non-trivial) tangent structure on the category of affine schemes? In this paper, we characterize the representable tangent structures on the category of affine schemes. To do so, we introduce a useful tool, the notion of tangentoids, which are the precisely the objects in a monoidal category that when tensoring with said objects give tangent structures. Therefore, coexponentiable tangentoids induce tangent structures on the opposite category. As such, we first prove that tangentoids in the category of commutative unital algebras are equivalent to commutative associative solid non-unital algebras, that is, commutative associative non-unital algebras whose multiplication is an isomorphism. From here, we then explain how representable tangent structures on affine schemes correspond to finitely generated projective commutative associative solid algebras. In particular, for affine schemes over a principal ideal domain, we show that there are precisely two representable tangent structures: the trivial one and the one given by K\"ahler differentials.</description>

      <title>Excellent metrics on triangulated categories, and the involutivity of the map taking $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathfrak{S}({\mathcal{S})^{\mathrm{op}}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the article arXiv:1806.06471 we defined good metrics on triangulated categories, and then studied the construction, that began with a triangulated category $\mathcal{S}$ together with a good metric $\{\mathcal{M}_i,\,i\in\mathbb{N}\}$, and out of it cooked up another triangulated category $\mathfrak(\mathcal{S})$. We went on to study examples, and produced many for which the construction is involutive. By this we mean that, if you let $\mathcal{T}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{S})^{\mathrm{op}}$, then there is a choice of metric on $\mathcal{T}$ for which $\mathcal{S}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{T})^{\mathrm{op}}$. In this article we study this phenomenon much more carefully, with the focus being on understanding the metrics for which involutivity occurs. As it turns out there is a large class of them, the excellent metrics on triangulated categories. At the end we will produce a few new examples of excellent metrics. And our reason for going to all this trouble is that the results of this article will permit us to prove new and surprising statements about uniqueness of enhancements. Those results will come in a sequel to this article, which is joint with Canonaco and Stellari.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic compactifications of integral models of Shimura varieties of abelian type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct good toroidal and minimal compactifications in the sense of Lan-Stroh for integral models of abelian-type Shimura varieties. We start with finding suitable types of cusp labels and cone decompositions which are compatible with those of the associated Hodge-type Shimura varieties. We then study the action of $\mathbb{Q}$-points of the adjoint group on boundary charts and toroidal compactifications of Hodge-type integral models. In particular, we extend the twisting construction of Kisin and Pappas to boundary charts. Finally, up to taking refinements of cone decompositions, we construct an abelian-type toroidal compactification as an open and closed algebraic subspace of a quotient from a disjoint union of Hodge-type toroidal compactifications. Furthermore, we construct minimal compactifications with a similar method and verify Pink's formula when the level at $p$ is an intersection of $n$ quasi-parahoric subgroups.</description>

      <title>Galois groups of simple abelian varieties over finite fields and exceptional Tate classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties over finite fields, extending previous results of Dupuy--Kedlaya--Zureick-Brown, Lenstra--Zarhin, Tankeev, and Zarhin. Notably, our methods allow us to prove the Tate conjecture in cases when the angle rank is non-maximal.
  Our primary tool is a precise combinatorial condition which, given a geometrically simple abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$ with commutative endomorphism algebra, describes whether $A$ has exceptional classes (i.e., $\mathrm{Gal}( \bar{\mathbf{F}}_q/\mathbf{F}_q)$-invariant classes in $H_{\text{\'et}}^{2r}(A_{\bar{\mathbf{F}}_q}, \mathbf{Q}_\ell(r))$ not contained in the span of classes of intersections of divisors). The criterion depends only on the Galois group of the minimal polynomial of Frobenius and its action on the Newton polygon of $A$.
  Our tools provide substantial control over the isogeny invariants of $A$, allowing us to prove a number of new results. Firstly, we provide an algorithm which, given a Newton polygon and CM field, determines if they arise from a geometrically simple abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$ and, if so, outputs one such $A$. As a consequence we show that every CM field occurs as the center of the endomorphism algebra of an abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$. Secondly, we refine a result of Tankeev and Dupuy--Kedlaya--Zureick-Brown on angle ranks of abelian varieties. In particular, we show that ordinary geometrically simple varieties of prime dimension have maximal angle rank.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft bundles on the complete flag threefold and moduli spaces of instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the moduli spaces of instanton bundles on the flag twistor space $F:=F(0,1,2)$. We stratify them in terms of the minimal twist supporting global sections and we introduce the notion of (special) 't Hooft bundle on $F$. In particular we prove that there exist $\mu$-stable 't Hooft bundles for each admissible charge $k$. We completely describe the geometric structure of the moduli space of (special) 't Hooft bundles for arbitrary charge $k$. Along the way to reach these goals, we describe the possible structures of multiple curves supported on some rational curves in $F$ as well as the family of del Pezzo surfaces realized as hyperplane sections of $F$. Finally we investigate the splitting behaviour of 't Hooft bundles when restricted to conics.</description>

      <title>Existence of arithmetic degrees for generic orbits and dynamical Lang-Siegel problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of the arithmetic degree for dominant rational self-maps at any point whose orbit is generic. As a corollary, we prove the same existence for \'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any points on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem. Namely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional subscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable assumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed subscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that such subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.</description>

      <title>The N\'eron model of a higher-dimensional Lagrangian fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X \to B$ be a projective Lagrangian fibration of a smooth symplectic variety $X$ to a smooth variety $B$. Denote the complement of the discriminant locus by $B_0 = B \setminus \operatorname{Disc}(\pi)$, its preimage by $X_0 = \pi^{-1}(B_0)$, and the complement of the critical locus by $X' = X \setminus \operatorname{Sing}(\pi)$. Under an assumption that the morphism $X' \to B$ is surjective, we construct (1) the N\'eron model of the abelian fibration $\pi_0 : X_0 \to B_0$ and (2) the N\'eron model of its automorphism abelian scheme $\operatorname{Aut}^{\circ}_{\pi_0} \to B_0$. Contrary to the case of elliptic fibrations, $X'$ may not be the N\'eron model of $X_0$; this is precisely because of the existence of flops in higher-dimensional symplectic varieties. Using such techniques, we analyze when $X' \to B$ is a torsor under a smooth group scheme and also revisit some known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of slope stability and the Hermitian Einstein metric for big cohomology classes. The main result is the Kobayashi Hitchin correspondence on compact normal spaces with big classes admitting the birational Zariski decomposition with semiample positive part. We also prove the Bogomolov Gieseker inequality for slope stable sheaves with respect to big and nef classes. Through this paper, the bimeromorphic invariance of slope stability and the existence of Hermitian Einstein metrics plays an essential role.</description>

      <title>A remark on some punctual Quot schemes on smooth projective curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on a smooth projective curve, we can define the punctual Quot scheme which parametrizes torsion quotients of $\mathcal{E}$ of length $n$ supported at a fixed point. It is known that the punctual Quot scheme is a normal projective variety with canonical Gorenstein singularities. In this note, we show that the punctual Quot scheme is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial Fano variety of Picard number one.</description>

      <title>On distribution of supersingular primes of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let X be an abelian variety or a K3 surface defined over a number field K. We prove that the density of the supersingular primes of X is zero if X is non-CM. By applying an effective Chebotarev density theorem of Serre, we obtain asymptotic upper bounds of the counting function for these supersingular primes.</description>

      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. We show the complete prime spectrum is functorial and give a characterization of when a monoidal exact functor induces a well-defined map on noncommutative Balmer spectra. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>
