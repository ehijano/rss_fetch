      <title>Detailed Analysis of the Superconducting Gap with Pair-Breaking Scattering: Dynes Superconductor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy gap $\Delta(T)$ within the Dynes superconductor theory. This model generalizes the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) approach by including the pair-breaking scattering, introducing the tunneling in-gap states up to a Fermi level. We analytically solve the energy gap equation in various limit cases. The solution provides simple tools for further studies, compared to more complex numerics, and highlights the basic characteristics of the theory. First, in the critical limit of pair-breaking scattering, we derive (inspired by the famous BCS ratio) $\Delta_0/T_c = \sqrt{2/3}\pi$. Next, we derive the dependence $ \Delta(T)$ close to critical temperature and look at its behavior for general (and also critical) pair-breaking scattering rate $\Gamma$. Furthermore, we compare our result - analytical dependence of $\Delta(T)$ - with the numerical solution of the gap equation assuming general temperature. We show the range of temperatures, for which the analytical approximation is valid. In the end, we introduce the heuristic formula of $\Delta(0\leq T\leq T_c)$, assuming general pair-breaking scattering, emphasizing its exact behavior close to $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Normal-state resistivity and the depairing current density of BaFe$_2$(As,P)$_2$ nanobridges along the $c$ axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report precise measurements to obtain the normal-state resistivity and the depairing current density of BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$($x\sim0.29-0.32$) nanobridges along the $c$ axis, which are fabricated from single crystals near the optimal doping, by using focused ion beam (FIB) techniques. We obtained both of the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis resistivity ($\rho_{ab}$ and $\rho_c$) in the same part of a specimen, by fabricating the $c$-axis nanobridge in the middle of a narrow bridge extended in $ab$-plane, in spite of the slight deficiency of P dopant due to the additional FIB fabrication. The normal-state resistivity anisotropy agreed with the previous results for bulk samples, showing $\rho_c/\rho_{ab} &lt; 8$ just above the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, in the slightly underdoped region and a slight decrease with increasing temperatures. The critical current density obtained in the $c$-axis nanobridges near the optimal doping reaches $\sim$8 MA/cm$^2$ at 0.15$T_c$, corresponding to about 87 % of a depairing limit derived by the Eilenberger equations. An extrapolation to $T=$0 K using the Ginzburg-Landau model suggests that the anisotropy of the depairing current density roughly corresponds to that of the normal-state resistivity. At low temperatures, we also observed a step-like voltage jump before arriving at the depairing limit, suggesting the occurrence of phase-slip phenomena near the depairing processes.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth and characterization of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1) from LiCl/KCl flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An eutectic LiCl/KCl flux method in a horizontal configuration has been used to grow a series of homogeneous Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ single crystals of high quality with 0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1. Compared with previously used melt-growth method, the stable crystallization process in LiCl/KCl flux below their peritectic temperatures results in better homogeneity and crystalline perfection identified by energy dispersive spectrometer and x-ray diffraction. The interstitial Fe value $\delta$ remains small within 0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.85 where the superconducting temperature $T_C$ is not sensitive to the Te content with sharp superconducting transition widths $\Delta$$T_C$ &lt; 1 K and a maximum of $T_C$ = 14.3 K at $x$ = 0.61. The value $\delta$ starts to increase quickly accompanied by a deviation of linear behavior of crystal lattice parameters as well as the broadening of $\Delta$$T_C$ = 2.1 K at $x$ = 0.91, then suddenly rises up to $\delta$ &gt; 0.1 followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and emergence of antiferromagnetic order at x $\geq$ 0.96. We also observed a metallic to semiconducting transition in the normal state resistivity of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with increasing Te content which is related to a localized electronic state induced by the interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe value $\delta$ might be a key physical parameter to understand various properties of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ system.</description>

      <title>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from C6-symmetric Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>

      <title>Fusion Rules of Majorana-Kramer-Pairs in Time-Reversal-Invariant Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the fusion rules of Majorana Kramers pairs in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors. We find that the fusion of Majorana Kramers pairs is a process that Ising anyons fuse independently in the two distinct time-reversal sectors. Considering the full fusion including the initialization and the fusion, we explore the observation of a supersymmetry that emerges in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors, and design the schemes for the nontrivial fusion and the trivial fusion to show the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana Kramers pairs. We also show the possible influence of local adiabatic mixing on the fusion and the differentiation between distinct fusion processes remains feasible even in the presence of such mixing. Our proposals are applied in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave topological superconductors, and the theoretical framework can be extended to the fusion of multiple Majorana zero modes protected by unitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>Two-component superconductivity and strange metallicity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: A Schwinger boson study of the $t$-$V$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its effective low-energy theory. One promising scenario is the $t$-$V$-$J$ model proposed in [Phys. Rev. B $\mathbf{108}$, L201108 (2023)], which attributes the superconductivity to the local interlayer $d_{z^2}$ spin singlets and their hybridization with the metallic $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands. Using the Schwinger boson approach to the $t$-$V$-$J$ model, a global phase diagram is obtained with metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition. We predict a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity and a maximum $T_c$ in good consistency with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid behaviors due to the hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work provides a consistent understanding of the superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario from others.</description>

      <title>Magnetic exchange interaction in spin-valve with chiral spin-triplet superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between two ferromagnets separated by a superconductor has been mostly investigated for the case of Cooper pairs with spin-singlet symmetry. Here, we consider a spin-triplet superconductor with chiral pairing. By full self-consistent analysis of the spatial dependent superconducting order parameter, we determine the magnetic ground state of the superconducting spin valve. The study is performed by investigating the role of the orientation and strength of the magnetization in the ferromagnets including spin-valve asymmetries in the magnetic configurations. Due to the nonvanishing angular momentum of the spin-triplet Cooper pairs we demonstrate that the induced magnetic coupling has an anisotropic character and a structure that can favor collinear or noncollinear magnetic orientations, thus mimicking a magnetic interaction of the Heisenberg or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type, respectively. We investigate the role of the physical parameters controlling the character of the magnetic exchange: the amplitude of the magnetization in the ferromagnets and the length of the superconducting spacer in the spin valve. Our study demonstrates that spin-triplet superconductors can be employed to devise anisotropic magnetic exchange and to allow for transitions in the spin-valve state from a collinear to noncollinear magnetic configuration.</description>

      <title>Diverse Impacts of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering non-Abelian quasiparticles by combining superconductivity and topological states have been proposed as a route to realize topological quantum computation. Rhombohedral multilayer graphene with layer number N&gt;=3 has been shown as a promising platform, as it hosts integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects when proximitized by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) and a moire potential. However, superconductivity in similar devices have remained largely unexplored, although proximitized spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effect has been shown to strengthen or induce superconductivity in both crystalline and twisted graphene. Here we report electron transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) at temperatures down to 40 mK. We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with a transition temperature Tc of 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase. Near this three-quarter-metal state, the state SC3, very weak in bare RTG, is fully developed into a superconducting state at 110 mK. By performing fermiology analysis based on the quantum oscillation measurement, we showed that the SC3 and SC4 states reside at the phase boundaries between different isospin-symmetry-breaking states. These observations are aligned with the existing understanding that SOC enhances graphene superconductivity. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD, and we cannot find it down to the base temperature of our measurement. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices, and provide experimental evidence that challenges the understanding of the impacts of SOC on graphene superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Chemical versus physical pressure effects on the structure transition of bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of high-$T_c$ superconductivity (HTSC) in concomitant with pressure-induced orthorhombic-tetragonal structural transition in the bilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has sparked hopes of achieving HTSC by stabilizing the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure. To mimic the effect of external physical pressures, the application of chemical pressure via replacing La$^3$$^+$ with smaller rare-earth R$^3$$^+$ has been considered as a potential route. Here we clarify the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the structural transition of bilayer nickelates through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. Contrary to general expectations, we find that substitutions of smaller R$^3$$^+$ for La$^3$$^+$ in La$_{3-x}$R$_x$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, despite of an overall lattice contraction, produce stronger orthorhombic structural distortions and thus require higher pressures to induce the structural transition. We established a quantitative relationship between the critical pressure $P_c$ for structural transition and the average size of $A$-site cations. A linear extrapolation of $P_c$ versus &lt;$r_A$&gt; yields a putative critical value of &lt;$r_A$&gt;$_c$ ~ 1.23 angstrom for $P_c$ ~ 1 bar. The negative correlation between $P_c$ and &lt;$r_A$&gt; indicates that it is unlikely to reduce $P_c$ to ambient by replacing La$^3$$^+$ with smaller R$^3$$^+$ ions. Instead, partial substitution of La$^3$$^+$ with larger cations such as alkaline-earth Sr$^2$$^+$ or Ba$^2$$^+$ might be a feasible approach. Our results provide valuable guidelines in the quest of ambient-pressure HTSC in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Magnetically modulated superconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) Josephson junctions and their tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based Josephson junctions played an important role in various quantum devices from their inception. Magnetic tunnel junctions or vertical devices were also made out of graphene by exposing the graphene layer to localised pattern of strong magnetic field created by hard ferromagnetic material. By combining the essence of these different methods for constructing graphene based junctions, in this work we propose that the temperature-dependent Josephson current in such junctions can be tuned by exposing the graphene regions to a combination of highly localised non-uniform magnetic field, dubbed as magnetic barrier, and spatially modulated gate voltage. Within the framework of Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (DBDG) theory, we show by explicit calculation that in such magnetically modulated Josephson Junctions, the band structure of graphene gets significantly altered, which results in the change of the Andreev reflections in such junctions. This leads to a significant modulation of the Josephson current. We numerically evaluated the Josephson current as a function of the strength of the magnetic barrier and the gate voltage and discussed the practical consequences of such controlling of Josephson currents.</description>

      <title>The fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an analytical explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic excitonic magnetism from discrete $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ symmetry in CeRhIn$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy in strongly correlated materials is a central parameter in determining the electronic ground state and is tuned through the local crystalline electric field. This is notably the case in the CeCo$_{x}$Rh$_{1-x}$In$_{5}$ system where the ground-state wave function can provide the basis for antiferromagnetism and/or unconventional superconductivity. We develop a methodology to understand the local magnetic anisotropy and experimentally investigate with neutron spectroscopy applied to antiferromagnetic ($T_{N}$=3.8 K) CeRhIn$_{5}$ which is isostructural to $d$-wave superconducting ($T_{c}$=2.3 K) CeCoIn$_{5}$. Through diagonalizing the local crystal field Hamiltonian with discrete tetragonal $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ point group symmetry and coupling these states with the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), we find two distinct modes polarized along the crystallographic $c$ and $a-b$ planes, agreeing with experiment. The anisotropy and bandwidth, underlying the energy scale of these modes, are tuneable with a magnetic field which we use experimentally to separate in energy single and multiparticle excitations thereby demonstrating the instability of excitations polarized within the crystallographic $a-b$ plane in CeRhIn$_{5}$. We compare this approach to a $S_{eff}={1\over 2}$ parameterizations and argue for the need to extend conventional SU(2) theories of magnetic excitations to utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying crystal-field basis states constrained by the local point-group $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We apply a wavefunction approach to study the charge 4$e$ superconductor. The wavefunction takes a similar structure to the BCS wavefunction for charge 2$e$ superconductors. The mean-field Hamiltonian and the Green's functions of charge 4$e$ are constructed. The physical properties including the density of states, gauge invariance, flux quantization, superfluid density and Josephson effects are systematically studied. All these results form a microscopic description of the charge 4$e$ SC and can be served as the hallmarks for experimental verifications.</description>

Abstract: Bloch wave functions of electrons have properties called quantum geometry, which has recently attracted much attention as the origin of intriguing physical phenomena. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the quantum-geometric pair potentials (QGPP) based on the generalized band representation and thereby clarify how the quantum geometry of electrons is transferred to the Cooper pairs they form. QGPP quantifies the deviation of multiband superconductors from an assembly of single-band superconductors and has a direct connection to the quantum-geometric corrections to thermodynamic coefficients. We also discuss their potential ability to emulate exotic pair potentials and engineer intriguing superconducting phenomena including topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Reduced decay in Josephson coupling across ferromagnetic junctions with spin-orbit coupling layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of $S_z=1$ triplet Cooper pairs has been predicted theoretically in superconducting-ferromagnetic hybrid heterostructures in the presence of spin-orbit coupling [F. S. Bergeret and I. V. Tokatly, Phys. Rev. B 89, 134517 (2014) and Jacobsen et al., Sci. Rep. 6, 23926 (2016)]. In this study, we experimentally investigate vertical Josephson junctions where the weak link is formed from a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy sandwiched by two non-magnetic layers with weak or strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that the decay of the Josephson coupling is reduced in the latter case, possibly indicating the presence of $S_z=1$ spin-triplet correlations. We speculate that the canted magnetization required for these correlations is provided by the interaction of magnetization with Meissner effect in the superconducting layers.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>

      <title>Controlling Majorana hybridization in magnetic chain-superconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description. Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits with multiterminal Josephson-Andreev junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of single channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise protected qubits, which map to the bifluxon and $0{-}\pi$ qubits in the tunneling regime. We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description of these quantum circuits dynamics.</description>
