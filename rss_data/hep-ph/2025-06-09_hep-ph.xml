      <title>Diffuse astrophysical neutrinos from dark matter around blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos from blazars can originate from inelastic scatterings between protons within their jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around them, explaining IceCube detections of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 that are otherwise challenging for models of its jet. In this paper we calculate such DM-induced high-energy neutrinos, from TXS 0506+056 as well as from a stacked blazar sample, in the four cases where DM-quark interactions are mediated by a new massive vector, axial, scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Intriguingly, we find that this mechanism can saturate the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube at high energies. Our mechanism will be tested by additional blazar observations and by various searches for sub-GeV DM.</description>

      <title>Inequalities for Standard Model Yukawa Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Standard Model Yukawa matrices satisfy a set of simple yet nontrivial inequalities. The relations we derive are independent of the basis used to define the fermion fields, and, amongst other things, place strong constraints on the alignment of the columns of the up-type and down-type Yukawa matrices, as well as their cofactor matrices. The reason why one can obtain such strong statements can be traced back to the hierarchical nature of the fermion masses and quark mixings. The inequalities should be seen as very strong necessary conditions on the Standard Model Yukawa couplings and thus are useful for constraining flavor models.</description>

      <title>Saving or Destroying the Universe with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pseudoscalar resonances that couple to the Standard Model via non-renormalizable operators, such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), generate contributions to the renormalization group evolution equations of couplings of dimension-4 and higher-dimensional operators. In particular, they modify the $\beta$-function of the Higgs quartic coupling and of SM and SMEFT parameters entering this equation, thus having an impact on the instability scale of the electroweak vacuum. We employ this fact together with the requirement that, in the presence of axions and ALPs, the Universe remains in a meta-stable state to deduce bounds on ALP couplings to the Standard Model fields. We also show that the modification of the $\beta$-functions of the gauge couplings by the ALP can lead to a unification around the Planck scale, even in non-sypersymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Light Scalars in the Extended Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform global fits of the CP-conserving Georgi-Machacek (GM) and extended Georgi-Machacek (eGM) models, incorporating a light CP-even beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scalar within the mass range of $90$ GeV to $100$ GeV. These fits combine the Higgs signal strengths and direct search limits from ATLAS and CMS at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ and $13$ TeV, $B$-physics observables, and theoretical constraints arising from next-to-leading order (NLO) unitarity and BFB constraints. From the global fit, we show that the LHC diphoton and LEP $b\bar{b}$ excesses around $95$ GeV are well compatible with the $125$ GeV Higgs data. Whereas the CMS ditau excess is incompatible with the $125$ GeV Higgs signal strength data in both the CP-conserving GM and eGM models. We present the results from the combined fit, including the $95$ GeV Higgs signal strength data. In the eGM model, the triplet VEV cannot exceed $12$ GeV for additional BSM scalar masses below $160$ GeV and approximately $25$ GeV for additional BSM scalar masses above $160$ GeV. The masses of additional BSM scalars cannot exceed $600$ GeV. The maximum mass splitting is of around $120$ GeV within the members of each custodial multiplet, and up to $250$ GeV between the members of different multiplets. In the GM model, these constraints become more stringent: the triplet VEV is limited to below $15$ GeV, which tightens to $4$ GeV once the BSM scalar masses are below $160$ GeV. Masses of the quintet $m_5$ and the triplet $m_3$ are restricted to be below $530$ GeV and $320$ GeV, respectively. A mass hierarchy, $m_5 &gt; m_3$, is favoured in the high-mass region, with the mass splitting constrained to be less than $210$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven High-Dimensional Statistical Inference with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crucial to many measurements at the LHC is the use of correlated multi-dimensional information to distinguish rare processes from large backgrounds, which is complicated by the poor modeling of many of the crucial backgrounds in Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we introduce HI-SIGMA, a method to perform unbinned high-dimensional statistical inference with data-driven background distributions. In contradistinction to many applications of Simulation Based Inference in High Energy Physics, HI-SIGMA relies on generative ML models, rather than classifiers, to learn the signal and background distributions in the high-dimensional space. These ML models allow for efficient, interpretable inference while also incorporating model errors and other sources of systematic uncertainties. We showcase this methodology on a simplified version of a di-Higgs measurement in the $bb\gamma\gamma$ final state, where the di-photon resonance allows for efficient background interpolation from sidebands into the signal region. We demonstrate that HI-SIGMA provides improved sensitivity as compared to standard classifier-based methods, and that systematic uncertainties can be straightforwardly incorporated by extending methods which have been used for histogram based analyses.</description>

      <title>Flavour and cosmological probes of Diracon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze two minimal extensions of the Standard Model featuring a spontaneously broken global, chiral, and anomaly-free $U(1)_D$ symmetry. This breaking generates naturally small Dirac neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism and yields a physical massless Goldstone boson, the Diracon. Although both models share the same particle content and scalar potential, their distinct symmetry breaking pattern leads to remarkably different phenomenological and cosmological signatures. In the first model, the Diracon couples weakly to charged leptons but right-handed neutrinos can be efficiently produced in the early Universe, resulting in stringent constraints from the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$. Conversely, in the second one, right-handed neutrino production is suppressed, and flavour-violating processes such as $\mu \to e \mathcal{D}$ provide the most promising probes. These simple but elegant models showcase the complementarity between cosmological observations and low-energy flavour experiments in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Universal Mass Equation for Equal-Quantum Excited-States Sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recent study of the universal mass equation for equal-quantum excited-states sets reported by Roper and Strakovsky~\cite{Roper:2024ovj}. The masses of twelve baryon sets and sixteen meson sets, with only two equal-quantum excited states in each set, using Breit-Wigner PDG2024 masses and their uncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by a simple one-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + M_1$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. Two accurate masses that start a set are used to calculate four higher masses in the set accurately. It is noted that $\alpha$ values for $b\bar{b}$ equal-quantum excited-states sets accurately lie on a straight line, whose line parameters can be used to calculate $\alpha$ and predict higher mass states for $b\bar{b}$ sets that have only one known member.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $D_{e4}$ decays: hadronic dynamics and the determination of $|V_{cs}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-body decays $D^+ \to K^-\pi^+e^+\nu_e$ ($D_{e4}^+$) and $D^0\to \overline{K^0}\pi^-e^+\nu_e$ ($D^0_{e4}$) are studied in a model where the momentum-dependence of the hadronic matrix elements are described in terms of $K^*(892)$ and $D^*(2010)$ pole contributions. From fits to the recent data of the BESIII collaboration we find that the $D^*$-pole can mimic the effect of the $S$-wave contribution of the $K\pi$ system, which has been suggested as an observational evidence for the light scalar strange resonance. Implications for the determination of the $|V_{cs}|$ quark mixing matrix element are discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the medium-like effects in the jet-like yield in pp and p-Pb collisions using event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of jet-medium interaction in small systems such as proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particle production is studied in three distinct topological regions defined with respect to the charged particle with the highest transverse momentum in the event ($p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$). The jet-like yield is defined by the particle density in the toward region ($|\Delta\varphi|&lt;\pi/3$) after subtracting that in the transverse region ($\pi/3&lt;|\Delta\varphi|&lt;2\pi/3$). The activity on the transverse side is used as a proxy for medium-like effects. Three different Monte Carlo event generators -- \textsc{Pythia8}, a multiphase transport (AMPT) model, and EPOS4 -- are employed to investigate particle yields as a function of $p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$ in the interval 0.5-20\,GeV/$c$. Calculations are performed for the $p_{\rm T}$ threshold of 0.5 GeV/$c$ at mid-rapidity ($|\eta| &lt; 0.8$). The jet-like yield in the toward region for pp collisions show interesting dynamics; they are significantly affected by the medium-like effects in the low to intermediate $p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$ ($&lt;8$\,GeV/$c$) which is studied through color reconnection and hydrodynamics in \textsc{Pythia8} and EPOS4, respectively. However, the results from AMPT show that the jet-like yield is medium-like modified throughout the entire $p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$ range. The jet-like yield in p-Pb collisions using AMPT is also studied. Notably, a dip structure that is observed in the jet-like signal ratio of pp to p-Pb at low $p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$ in ALICE data, is reproduced by AMPT model with string melting on, pointing to possible medium-like behavior in small systems. The results of this article also underscore the importance of high-$p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}$ ($p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig} &gt;$ 8 GeV/$c$) for minimizing underlying event biases in jet-related studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating the most active pp collisions (top 0.1 %) using the tools developed by experiments at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHC data have unveiled unexpected features in proton-proton (pp) collisions, namely, collective-like behavior and strangeness enhancement. Originally, these new effects were discovered only in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, recently the ALICE Collaboration has shown that even low-multiplicity pp collisions yield a non-zero elliptic flow ($v_{2}$). Moreover, analyses as functions of the event structure, such as transverse spherocity, suggest that multiplicity might not be the main driver of the new effects. Therefore, new ways of analyzing the data have to be explored in order to understand the origin of the new phenomena. In this paper, pp collisions simulated with PYTHIA 8 are analyzed using different event estimators (mid-pseudorapidity multiplicity, spherocity, sphericity, $R_{\rm T}$, forward multiplicity and flattenicity). The features of the selected events for the top 0.1 % using the different estimators are discussed. The results suggest that flattenicity is the estimator with the least biases on the neutral-to-charged particle ratio, as well as on the bias towards harder-than-average pp collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the mass spectra of excited charmonia employing a nonrelativistic potential model with screening effect, and analyze their two-body strong decay, two-photon decay, leptonic decay, and hadronic transitions. Especially, we find that the newly observed resonances $X(4160)$, $Y(4500)$, and $Y(4710)$ can be identified as $3^3P_0$, $3^3D_1$, and $4^3D_1$ states, respectively. We also predict the masses and the widths of higher excited states in the charmonia family.</description>

      <title>Composite Hybrid Inflation : Primordial Black Holes and Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in composite hybrid inflation. Starting from an effective chiral Lagrangian with a dilaton and pions, we identify inflation occurring due to the walking dynamics of the theory. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking term in the pion sector induces a shift in the inflaton's trajectory, which leads to a tachyonic instability phase. Curvature perturbations grow exponentially, producing copious primordial black holes and a stochastic gravitational wave background. We show that the primordial black hole mass and the gravitational wave frequency are strongly restricted by the anomalous dimensions of the pion operators, with larger anomalous dimensions giving lighter primordial black holes and higher frequency gravitational waves. In both cases, the associated signatures lie within reach of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>$Z_{cs}^+$ production in the $B^+$ decays process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we studied the $Z_{cs}^+$ exotic state production in the $B^+$ meson decays through the meson loop mechanism, where the $B^+$ meson decays into an anti-charmed meson and a charmed-strange meson pair, and consequently couples to $Z_{cs}$ and a light meson ($\phi,\rho^0,\omega,\eta,\eta^\prime$, and $\pi^0$) via exchanging a proper charmed or charmed-strange meson. Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we estimated the branching fractions of different channels find them to be on the order of $10^{-4}$ and their ratios are almost independent of the model parameter. The fit fractions of $Z_{cs}^+$ in different $B^+$ decay processes are also estimated, and we propose searching for $Z_{cs}^+$ in the $B^+ \to J/\psi K^+\eta^\prime$ process, which should be accessible to both Belle II and LHCb Collaborations.</description>

      <title>New Types of Hydrogenlike matter Composed of Electron(s) and Meson(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we predict the existence of new types of hydrogenlike matter, including hydrogenlike atoms ($\pi^+e^-$, $K^+e^-$, $D^+e^-$), hydrogenlike molecular ions ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-$) and hydrogenlike molecules ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-e^-$). By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the binding energy of hydrogenlike atoms is obtained as $E_n=-\frac{1}{2n^2}$. For hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, the variational method is employed to calculate the binding energies, i.e., $E_+=-0.587$ and $E_0=-1.139$ for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, respectively. And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic unit for convenience. In additon, the strong interaction between the two constituent mesons is considered in our calculations, where we find that its influence on the hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules can be neglected. Hopefully, these types of matter would be observed in the future with the improvement of accuracy in the high energy physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Dense matter in a holographic hard-wall model of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deeper understanding of QCD matter at strong coupling remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature. To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection of Dark Matter Around a Supermassive Black Hole with High Energy-Resolution Gamma-Ray Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore whether the unprecedented energy resolution of upcoming gamma-ray telescopes can uncover relativistic effects in photon spectra resulting from dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC), specifically, gravitational redshift, Doppler broadening due to Lorentz boosts, and kinetic energy enhancements arising from high DM velocities. By modeling DM density and velocity profiles under various SMBH formation scenarios and DM properties, we calculate the corresponding gamma-ray spectra and identify the conditions under which SMBH-induced spectral distortions become observable. We find that, in favorable cases, the observed spectra encode the DM velocity distribution near the SMBH, enabling potential discrimination among annihilation mechanisms with different velocity dependencies. Even when SMBH-induced effects are modest, the upcoming COSI mission, with sub-percent energy resolution surpassing the typical DM velocity dispersion at the GC, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, may still be able to detect subtle Doppler broadening. These results highlight a promising pathway for determining the origin of gamma-ray signals and probing DM properties through high-resolution spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Decays $f_1 \to a_0 \pi,\pi \pi \pi(\eta)$ and $f_1 \to K K \pi$ in the chiral $U(3) \times U(3)$ quark NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The branching fractions of the axial vector meson decays $f_1 \to a_0 \pi,\pi\pi\eta$, $f_1 \to \rho \pi,\pi\pi\pi$ and $f_1 \to KK\pi$ are calculated in the standard $U(3) \times U(3)$ quark NJL model. The intermediate channels with the states $a_0(980)\pi$ and $f_0(500)\eta$ are taken into account in the decay $f_1 \to \pi\pi\eta$. In the case of the scalar mesons, the $\bar{q}q$ representation as a chiral symmetric partners of the pseudoscalar mesons is used. It is shown that the decays $f_1 \to \rho \pi$ and $f_1 \to3\pi$ occur due to the mass difference of the $u$ and $d$ quarks. All the results are obtained without using any additional arbitrary parameters and are in satisfactory agreement with the known experimental data.</description>

      <title>Open-Flavor Heavy Hadron Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of open-flavor heavy hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The hadronization in the quark-gluon plasma is described in the quark coalescence model. We evaluated yields and transverse momentum distributions. A simultaneous study of conventional and exotic hadrons is carried out. The Wigner functions are evaluated using hadron wave functions obtained from a single realistic quark model. Thus, results are presented in a single framework for the production of open-flavor heavy mesons, baryons, and exotic tetraquarks, in particular: $D^{0}$, $B^{0}$, $\Lambda_{Q}$, $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi_{Q}$, $\Xi_{QQ^\prime}$, and $T_{QQ^\prime}$ ($Q,Q^\prime=c$ or $b$). The consequences of a partial restoration of chiral symmetry at the hadronization temperature are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Squeezing effect on three-dimensional Hanbury Brown-Twiss radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impacts of the squeezing effect caused by the particle's in-medium mass modification on the three-dimensional Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii. An analysis is conducted on how the squeezing effect impacts the three-dimensional HBT radii of $\phi\phi$, $D^0$$D^0$, and $K^+$$K^+$. The squeezing effect suppresses the impacts of transverse flow on the transverse source distribution and broadens the space-time rapidity distribution of the particle-emitting source, leading to an increase in the HBT radii, notably in out and longitudinal direction. This phenomenon becomes more significant for higher transverse pair momentum, resulting in a non-monotonic decrease in the HBT radii with increasing transverse pair momentum. The impact of the squeezing effect on the HBT radii is more pronounced for $D^0$$D^0$ than for $\phi\phi$. Furthermore, this effect is also more significant for $\phi$$\phi$ than for $K^+$$K^+$. The findings presented in this paper could offer fresh perspectives on investigating the squeezing effect.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signals in a Promising Realization of SO(10) Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational wave signals in a non-supersymmetric grand unified model where the group $SO(10)$ is broken in two steps to the Standard Model gauge group. We calculate the analytical form of the one-loop effective potential responsible for the first step of symmetry breaking and show that it can lead to a first-order phase transition with gravitational wave production. We also determine the gravitational wave background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles. The present experimental sensitivity is still far from the expected signals but could be in reach of novel detector concepts.</description>

      <title>$CP$ violation of two-body hadronic $\Lambda_b$ decays in the PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the $CP$-averaged branching ratios and $CP$ violations (CPVs) for the two-body hadronic decays $\Lambda_b\to ph$, where $h$ runs through the mesons $\pi^-$, $\rho^-$, $a_1^-(1260)$, $K^-$, $K^{\ast -}$, $K_1^-(1270)$ and $K_1^-(1400)$, in the perturbative QCD approach to order $\alpha_s^2$ in the strong coupling. Various topological amplitudes are obtained by incorporating subleading-twist hadron distribution amplitudes, which exhibit reasonable hierarchical patterns, sizable strong phases, and non-negligible higher-power corrections. The predicted direct CPVs in $\Lambda_b\to p\pi^-,pK^-$, different from those in similar $B$ meson decays, are as small as the current data. The low CPV in $\Lambda_b\to p\pi^-$ results from the cancellation between the $S$- and $P$-wave CPVs, while the one in $\Lambda_b\to pK^-$ is determined by the tiny $S$-wave CPV. However, individual partial-wave CPVs can exceed $10\%$, consistent with direct CPVs in $B$ meson decays. The CPVs in the $\Lambda_b\to pK_1^-(1270),pK_1^-(1400)$ channels are relatively larger. In particular, CPVs above $20\%$ appear in the up-down asymmetries associated with the final-state angular distributions of $\Lambda_b\to pK_1^-(1270),pK_1^-(1400)$, followed by the secondary $K_1\to K\pi\pi$ decays. These observables offer promising prospects for firmly establishing baryon CPVs. The decay asymmetry parameters of $\Lambda_b\to ph$ are also predicted for future experimental confrontations.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Propagation and Dynamics of Oscillating Tetraquark Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have presented a theoretical investigation into the behavior of tetraquark states. These states are modeled as a non-relativistic four-body quantum system governed by harmonic interactions. Our goal is to capture the fundamental dynamics of quark-antiquark interactions in the tetraquark configuration. Within this framework, we have derived an analytical expression for the quantum propagator. This expression was then used to compute the time evolution of the wave function and the associated probability density. We examined the time evolution and oscillation patterns to gain a better understanding of the wave function and its probability of presence in space. This approach offers valuable insights into the dynamics of the tetraquark system. This model can serve as a basis for predicting complex structures such as entanglement and multipartite dependence of quarks.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Evolution of Nuclear Excitation at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of nuclear excitation in electron-nucleus (e+A) collisions at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using the BeAGLE event generator. Leveraging the EIC's unique collider kinematics, we demonstrate the remarkable capability to separate distinct nuclear reaction stages, hard scattering, intranuclear cascade, and nuclear de-excitation, in the laboratory frame. Our systematic analysis reveals that event-by-event fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum (k) are highly sensitive to the intranuclear cascade formation time and nuclear geometry, while minimally affected by variations in electron beam energy. These findings establish k as a robust observable for constraining nuclear excitation mechanisms, providing critical benchmarks for future EIC experiments and guiding theoretical advancements in nuclear transport modeling.</description>

      <title>Three-loop QCD Mass Relation between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and Symmetric-momentum Subtraction Scheme Away from the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbative result for the quark-mass conversion factor between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and regularization-independent symmetric-momentum subtraction scheme (RI/SMOM) away from the chiral limit, i.e. at non-zero quark masses (RI/mSMOM), is derived up to three loops in QCD, extending the existing result by two additional orders. We further explore an illuminating possibility that in Dimensional Regularization, the original RI/(m)SMOM renormalization conditions may be interpreted merely in a weaker sense, namely as equations holding just in the 4-dimensional limit rather than exactly in $d$ dimensions: they work and result in different, albeit simpler, renormalization constants but still the same finite conversion factor. This novel observation has the added benefit of reducing computational effort, particularly at high orders. Furthermore we show that the two renormalization conditions considered for the scalar operator yield factors differing from the pseudoscalar case beyond one loop, but both converge to the latter in the chiral limit. Lastly, our result for the conversion factor exhibits rich behaviors, and in particular a window is observed in the subtraction scale and mass where it receives less perturbative corrections than the RI/SMOM counterpart up to three loops; this finding may help to further improve the accuracy of $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ quark-mass determinations with Lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Proton Gravitational Structure and Mass Decomposition on the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons encode essential information about the internal distributions of mass, spin, pressure, and shear among their quark and gluon constituents. We compute the quark and gluon GFFs of the proton using a fully relativistic, nonperturbative framework based on a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) input. This allows us to quantify the impact of a dynamical gluon on the proton's mechanical properties, such as pressure and shear distributions. Our predictions agree well with recent lattice QCD results and experimental extractions. We also determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii and address the long-standing puzzle of its mass decomposition. At the scale $\mu^2 = 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, we find that quark energy, gluon field energy, the quark condensate, and the QCD trace anomaly contribute $31.5\%$, $34.7\%$, $11.3\%$, and $22.5\%$, respectively, which are consistent with lattice QCD findings.</description>

      <title>Probing Planck scale effects on absolute mass limit in neutrino flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the square roots of the neutrino masses, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with balanced gain and loss. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could lie within experimental sensitivity. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.</description>

Abstract: The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.</description>

      <title>Determining $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from the Heavy Jet Mass distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art analysis on determining the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from available $e^+e^-$ data for the Heavy Jet Mass (HJM) distribution. Dijet resummation is supplemented with additional resummation of shoulder logarithms appearing around the symmetric 3-jet configuration of the HJM spectrum. In addition to $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ we further obtain numerical results for two non-perturbative parameters, $\Omega_1^{\rho}$ and $\Theta_1$, encompassing effects from dijet and trijet hadronization effects, respectively.</description>

      <title>Torsion Balance Experiments Enable Direct Detection of Sub-eV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light dark matter with sub-eV masses has a high number density in our galaxy, and its scattering cross section with macroscopic objects can be significantly enhanced by coherence effects. Repeated scattering with a target object can induce a measurable acceleration. Torsion balance experiments with geometric asymmetry are, in principle, capable of detecting such signals. Our analysis shows that existing torsion balances designed to test the Equivalence Principle already place the most stringent constraints on DM-nucleon scattering in the $(10^{-2}, 1)\,$eV mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of ordering of radial vs.\ orbital excitations is reviewed. It is shown that the current quark models cannot explain the location of the Roper resonance which is slightly lower than the lowest negative-parity excitations. We also study some related spectral problems, such as the dependence of the energies on the quark masses, and the possibility of bound states in simple chromelectric models.</description>

      <title>Can Gravitational Wave Data Shed Light on Dark Matter Particles ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC), proven to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons, has been demonstrated to unambiguously pick theoretically computed logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula, which have a {\it negative} coefficient, when combined with the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. We propose a composite, `hybrid' approach to quantum gravity black hole entropy calculation, additively combining results from the non-peturbative, background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity method, with those from the perturbative (one loop), background-dependent semiclassical approach (often called `geometric' entropy) based on Euclidean Quantum Gravity. Our goal is to examine under what conditions, {\it absolute} consistency with HAT-validating GW data analyses is guaranteed. As a consequence of this demand for absolute consistency, nontrivial, albeit indirect, constraints appear to emerge on the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the spectrum of perturbative elementary particle fluctuations in a classical black hole background. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories, detectors, and distributions in the critical ${\rm O}(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore light-ray operators in the critical O$(N)$ model in the large-$N$ limit, focusing on leading-twist and leading ``horizontal" trajectories. We distinguish between light-ray operators in two conformal frames: detector operators, which characterize event shapes of final states, and distribution operators, which probe initial-state distributions. In particular, we identify parton distribution functions (PDFs) and collinear functions as matrix elements of appropriate distribution operators. We renormalize some simple detector operators at leading order in $1/N$, allowing us to extract the Regge intercept and the anomalous spin of the leading horizontal trajectory. We furthermore renormalize distribution versions of these operators, obtaining the leading-twist splitting function and a BFKL-type kernel, which match results from the detector frame. Finally, we show how these results can be read off from OPE data encoded in the Bethe-Salpeter resummation of conformal four-point functions.</description>

      <title>Seeing through the confinement screen: DGLAP/BFKL mixing and light-ray matching in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that collider observables such as hadron number flux can be matched onto a linear combination of detectors/light-ray operators in perturbative QCD. The spectrum of detectors in QCD is subtle, due to recombination between the DGLAP and BFKL trajectories. We explain how to define and renormalize these trajectories at one-loop, systematically incorporating their recombination. The leading and subleading soft gluon theorems play an important role, and our analysis suggests the presence of an infinite series of further subleading soft theorems for squared-amplitudes/form factors. Combined with our light-ray matching hypothesis, the anomalous dimensions of recombined DGLAP/BFKL detectors yield a prediction for the energy dependence of the number of particles in a jet, as well as other predictions for more general energy-weighted hadron measurements. We compare these predictions to Monte-Carlo simulations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD reveals the softening of matter in the cores of massive neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cores of neutron stars (NSs) contain the densest matter in the universe. Rapid advancements in neutron-star observations allow unprecedented empirical access to cold, ultra-dense Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter. The combination of these observations with theoretical calculations has revealed previously inaccessible features of the equation of state (EoS) and the QCD phase diagram. In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations at asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS at neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based solely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By constructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and incorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel pQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical observations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of stable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an indication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the conformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark matter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data and theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two scenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some kind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the cores of the most massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.</description>

Abstract: This document presents recent results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on supersymmetry (SUSY) searches. These searches provide results with some non-conventional SUSY search assumptions such as with compressed mass scenario or with long-lived particle scenario. Some of the recent results covers the unexplored SUSY phase space from prior results, brings a new insight to the SUSY landscape. Sensitivity on SUSY upper limits are enhanced with newly added LHC data, enhanced trigger algorithm or advanced event selection with machine learning (ML).</description>

      <title>Unveiling the role of vector potential in the Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential, which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness, the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector potential.</description>

Abstract: This article surveys our present understanding of the internal structure of the fully developed quark-gluon plasma at temperatures outside the crossover region. The theoretical part of the review covers perturbative and nonperturbative approaches to quark-gluon plasma structure, in particular, hard-thermal loop effective theory, lattice QCD and the functional renormalization group. The phenomenological part of the review scrutinizes the information that has been derived from bulk observables and hard probes in relativistic heavy ion collisions in terms of how it informs our knowledge about the structure of the quark-gluon plasma. The final section lists possible avenues for future progress.</description>

Abstract: Isotope shifts have emerged as a sensitive probe of new bosons that couple to electrons and neutrons, and of nuclear structure. The recent Hz- or even sub-Hz-level isotope shift measurements across different elements call for a global assessment of all available data. In this work, we present the fit framework kifit that for the first time enables a combined analysis of isotope shift data from several elements, taking into account correlations. We provide a thorough comparison of analytical methods and the fit to analyse linear and nonlinear King plots and quantify their uncertainties. Finally, we provide recommendations for future measurements that could enhance the sensitivity to new physics and offer new insights into nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Downward-going Milli-charged particles beyond GZK cutoff at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles (SHDM, $\phi$) with $\mathcal{O}$(ZeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs, $\chi$) via a channel $\phi\to\chi\bar{\chi}$ or $\gamma\chi\bar{\chi}$. The downward-going MCPs passing through the atmosphere can be measured by the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model is taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that we evaluated the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs at Auger assuming 14 years of Auger data. The hybrid data of Auger was fitted with the flux of UHE MCPs exceeding GZK-cutoff energy. Then the corresponding upper limits on $\epsilon^2$ are calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicate that MCPs can be directly detected with $\epsilon^2\gtrsim 2\times10^{-6}$ at Auger, when $m_{\phi}=2\times10^{21}$ eV and $\tau_{\phi}=10^{27}$ s. And a new region of 10$^{9.6}$ &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 10$^{11.6}$ eV and $\epsilon$ &gt; $2.12\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data. These results indicate potential existence of MCPs and SHDM in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we will study the geodesic motion of massive particles, in a Schwarzschild background, with a semi-classical quantum framework called "Polymer Quantum Mechanics" (PQM) in order to investigate the black hole phenomenology resulting from this formulation, which accounts for Planckian scale physics. In particular we studied two main scenarios, being the radial in-fall and circular orbits and their stability. In this framework, we built an effective Hamiltonian taking into account the polymer quantum effects, altering the classical equations of motion with Planckian scale corrections. As a main result, we obtained the existence of a classically forbidden region surrounding the event horizon, preventing particles from crossing it. Additionally, we discovered the presence of stable circular orbits below both the classical Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the horizon (corresponding to closed time-like geodesics).</description>

      <title>Model Comparisons of Transverse Energy and Charged-Particle Multiplicity in A+A Collisions at Midrapidity from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $=$ 7.7 to 200~GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of PHENIX measurements of transverse energy production ($dE_T/d\eta$) and charged-particle multiplicity ($dN/d\eta$) at midrapidity to simulations from PYTHIA-8, AMPT, HIJING, and SMASH. These comparisons span both small systems (d+Au, $^3$He+Au) and large systems (Cu+Cu, Cu+Au, Au+Au, and U+U) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\sim$ 200~GeV and Au+Au over a range of beam energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$--200~GeV. Using the Rivet framework, we assess the performance of these models. While general trends are captured, significant deviations persist, particularly in low-energy and peripheral collisions, underscoring the need for improved modeling of baryon stopping and energy deposition mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of the quark-meson model with omega and rho vector mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the functional renormalization group flow equations to investigate the phase structure of the two-flavor quark-meson model in the presence of a finite isospin chemical potential, incorporating interactions with omega and rho vector mesons. For comparison, we also compute the phase diagram in the chiral limit using the mean-field approximation. Our findings demonstrate that omega and rho mesons affect the phase structure in markedly distinct ways, and the introduction of an isospin chemical potential leads to significant modifications in the phase boundaries and critical region. Increasing the isospin chemical potential lowers the tricritical points temperature, and tends to suppress the unphysical ``back-bending" of the FRG phase boundary at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the mystery of $X(3872)$ with the coupled-channel dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$, as the first and the most crucial member in the exotic charmoniumlike $XYZ$ family, has been studied for a long time. However, its dynamical origin, whether stemming from a $D\bar{D}^*$ hadronic molecule or the first excited $P$-wave charmonium $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, remains controversial. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the $X(3872)$ definitely does not result from the mass shift of the higher bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ resonance pole in the coupled-channel dynamics involving a short-distance $c\bar{c}$ core and the long-distance $D\bar{D}^*$ channels. Instead, it originates from either the $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular pole or the shadow pole associated with the anti-resonance of the $P$-wave charmonium, depending on the weak or strong coupling mode, respectively. To differentiate these origins and fully exploit the nature of $X(3872)$, we conduct a comprehensive analysis in a couple-channel dynamics framework, including the isospin violation, the three-body $D\bar{D}\pi$ effect, the dynamical width of $D^*$, and non-open-charm decays of the bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the coupled-channel dynamics in explaining the disparity between the pole widths of $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}^+$, while also predicting a new resonance with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ around 4.0 GeV. By matching the newly observed $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ by the LHCb Collaboration to our predicted resonance, we conclude that the $X(3872)$ most likely originates from the $D\bar{D}^*$ pole with a confidence level exceeding $99.7\%$.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading Order Unitarity Fits in the Extended Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model is a triplet scalar extension of the Standard Model (SM) that preserves custodial symmetry (CS) due to an explicit global $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry in the scalar potential at tree-level. However, it is also possible to construct a triplet extended scalar sector of the SM without imposing this global symmetry in the potential while still maintaining CS at tree-level. This is referred to as the extended GM (eGM) model. We compute one-loop corrections to all $2\to2$ bosonic scattering amplitudes in both models and place next-to-leading order (NLO) unitarity bounds on the quartic couplings. Further, we derive the bounded-from-below (BFB) conditions on the quartic couplings demanding the stability of the scalar potential in the field subspaces. We show that the 3-field BFB conditions provide a very good approximation of the 13-field BFB conditions for both models and are computationally more efficient. With these theoretical constraints, we perform a global fit of both models to the latest Higgs signal strength results from the $13$ TeV Large Hadron Collider. We observe that the global fit disfavors the regions where $\kappa_V &gt; 1.05$, $\kappa_V &lt; 0.95$, and $\kappa_f &gt; 1.05$, $\kappa_f&lt; 0.92$ at a $95.4\%$ CL for both models. The global fit results demonstrate that NLO unitarity and stability bounds play a significant role in constraining the allowed parameter space of both models. We obtain an upper limit on the absolute values of the scalar quartic couplings to be $1.91\:(2.51)$ in the GM (eGM) model. We find that in both models, the absolute mass differences between the heavy Higgs bosons are less than $410$ GeV if their masses are below $1.1$ TeV. The maximal mass difference among the members of each CS multiplet is less than $210$ GeV in the eGM model.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the low-$p_{\rm T}$ pion excess in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the abundances of the final state hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are rather well described by the thermal particle production, the shape of the transverse momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, distribution below $p_{\rm T}\approx500$ MeV$/c$, is still poorly understood. We propose a procedure to quantify the model-to-data differences using Bayesian inference techniques, which allows for consistent treatment of the experimental uncertainties and tests the completeness of the available hydrodynamic frameworks. Using relativistic fluid framework Fluid${\it u}$M with PCE coupled to \trento initial state and FastReso decays, we analyse \pt distribution of identified charged hadrons measured in heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and the LHC energies, and identify an excess of pions produced below $p_{\rm T}\approx500$ MeV$/c$. Our results provide new input for the interpretation of the pion excess as either missing components in the thermal particle yield description or as an evidence for a different particle production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Collider and astrophysical signatures of light scalars with enhanced $\tau$ couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond Standard Model scenarios addressing the flavor puzzle and the hierarchy problem generally predict dominant new physics couplings with fermions of the third generation. In this Letter, we explore the collider and astrophysical signatures of new light scalar and pseudoscalar particles dominantly coupled to the $\tau$-lepton. The best experimental prospects are expected at Belle II through the $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-\gamma\gamma$, $\tau^+\tau^-\gamma$, $3\gamma$, mono-$\gamma$ processes, and the $\tau$ anomalous magnetic moment. The correlated effects in these searches can unambiguously point toward the underlying new physics dynamics. Moreover, we study astrophysics bounds - especially from core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers - finding them particularly effective and complementary to collider bounds. We carry out this program in the well-motivated context of axion-like particles as well as generic CP-even and CP-odd particles, highlighting possible ways to discriminate among them.</description>

Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-20}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $1~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>Long-lived particle phenomenology in one-loop neutrino mass models with dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) might have a common origin. The scotogenic model can be considered the proto-type model realizing this idea, but many other variants exist. In this paper we explore the phenomemology of a particular DM neutrino mass model, containing a triplet scalar. We calculate the relic density and check for constraints from direct detection experiments. The parameter space of the model, allowed by these constraints, contains typically a long-lived or quasi-stable doubly charged scalar, that can be searched for at the LHC. We reinterpret existing searches to derive limits on the masses of the scalars of the model and estimate future sensitivities in the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. The searches we discuss can serve to constrain also many other 1-loop neutrino mass models.</description>

Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate models that can induce significant modifications to the couplings of first- and second-generation quarks with Higgs bosons. Specifically, we identify all simplified models featuring two vector-like quark states which can lead to substantial enhancements in these couplings. In addition, these models generate operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory, both at tree-level and one-loop, that are constrained by electroweak precision and Higgs data. We show how to evade constraints from flavour physics and consider direct searches for vector-like quarks. Ultimately, we demonstrate that viable ultraviolet models can be found with first-generation quark Yukawa couplings enhanced by several hundred times their Standard Model value, while the Higgs couplings to charm (strange) quarks can be increased by factors of a few (few tens). Given the importance of electroweak precision data in constraining these models, we also discuss projections for future measurements at the Tera-$Z$ FCC-ee machine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ATOMKI nuclear anomaly has suggested a new BSM (Beyond the Standard Model) boson with mass $\sim17$ MeV emitted from excited nuclei and quickly decays into a pair of $e^+e^-$. In order to search for the new particle, we propose a new approach that utilizes the ongoing Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) 10-ton LAr (liquid argon) detectors. The neutrons from the Lujan target can scatter inelastically by the PMT glass in the CCM detector can produce the new boson which solves the ATOMKI anomaly. The new boson can be detected from its decay to a $e^+e^-$ pair. We find that CCM probes a large area of the anomaly-allowable parameter space. We also show the prediction for a 100-ton LAr detector and 5-ton EOS water detector.</description>

Abstract: We introduce multi-jet merging for deep inelastic scattering in the Vincia parton shower in the Monte Carlo event generator Pythia 8. Merging combines event samples of different parton multiplicities with logarithmically enhanced parton-shower radiation. We consider up to five outgoing partons using two different merging algorithms. We vary the relevant scale choices and compare to experimental data by H1 collaboration at the HERA collider. Results show that multi-jet merging improves description to data, especially for low virtuality events, and that jet cross-sections converge when the partonic multiplicity exceeds the number of reconstructed jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3+1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe requires new sources of charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) violation beyond those in the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects in the top-Higgs sector using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Focusing on top-pair production in association with a Higgs boson and single top-Higgs associated production at the LHC, we study $\mathcal{CP}$ violation in the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling and other Higgs and top interactions entering these processes. By analysing $\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive differential observables and asymmetries, we provide direct constraints on $\mathcal{CP}$-violating interactions in the top-Higgs sector. Our analysis demonstrates how combining $t\bar{t}h$ and $thj$ production can disentangle the real and imaginary components of the top-Yukawa coupling, offering valuable insights into potential sources of $\mathcal{CP}$ violation. The sensitivity of these observables to SMEFT operators provides model-independent constraints on the parameter space, advancing the search for new physics in the top-Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking effects in pion couplings to constituent quark currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudoscalar and axial neutral and charged pion-constituent quark coupling constants are investigated with nondegenerate quark masses in different kinematical points, off shell and on shell pions and constituent quarks. By considering a large quark mass expansion of a quark determinant in the presence of local pion field and of constituent quark background currents, gluonic effects are considered by means of an effective gluon propagator that dresses quark currents. For the neutral pion, mixing effects are introduced by means of the pion mixing to states $P_0$ and $P_8$, that give rise to the $\pi^0-\eta-\eta'$ meson mixing, and mixing of quark currents via corresponding mixing interactions. The relative behavior of charged and neutral pion coupling constants to quarks may be nearly the same - in the framework of the constituent quark model - as the pion-nucleon coupling constants if mixings are introduced. A very small pion coupling to strange quark current is also obtained. The dependence of the positive and negative pion-constituent quark coupling constant on the non-degeneracy of quark masses, for emission and absorption processes, is identified.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves of GUT Phase Transition during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grand unified theory (GUT) phase transition is generally considered unobservable due to its ultrahigh energy scale, and the monopole problem associated with GUT phase transition is one motivation of inflation. We propose that if a first-order GUT phase transition happens during inflation, the induced gravitational waves (GWs) are redshifted and deformed, and might be observed today in GW observatories. We review the formalism of inflated GWs and derive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW spectra in the instant-source or transitory-source application. It is valid for any e-folding number of instant or transitory source. Applying the formalism to GUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift the GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the future ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the discussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale. It is worth mentioning that, due to the deformation of the spectrum, the peak of inflated GWs is not simply a redshift of the peak of uninflated GWs.</description>

      <title>On the pole trajectory of the subthreshold negative parity nucleon with varying pion masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon pole, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons using the $N/D$ unitarization method. We find that as the pion mass increases, the pole moves toward the real axis. For larger pion masses, at tree level, the pole falls to a specific point on $u$-channel cut and crosses to the adjacent Riemann sheet defined by the logarithmic $u$ channel cut. At one-loop level, the pole does not meet the $u$-cut up to $m_\pi=0.36$GeV. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>Two-loop form factors for $P$-wave quarkonium production and decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analytical results for the two-loop form factors needed for $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay. We consider the two-loop corrections to the process $\gamma \gamma \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, that has been known only numerically before, and the processes $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, $\gamma g \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$ and $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$, which have not been computed before. We observe that the NRQCD pole structure of the two-loop amplitude in the $gg$ channel is more involved for the spin-triplet $P$-wave case than for the pseudo-scalar $S$-wave case. It involves in addition to the standard Coulomb singularity also a new singularity whose cancellation requires the inclusion of the $gg \leftrightarrow {^3S_1^{[8]}}$ form factor. We give the high precision numerical results for the hard functions that can be used to compute $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay up to NNLO accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Supernovae offer a unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. Three production channels are considered: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process, which was neglected in previous LFV-ALP studies, yields the strongest constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>The charming case of $X(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(2P)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than twenty years have elapsed since the discovery of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ (previously denoted as $X(3872)$), and an impressive amount of theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to its properties, decays and production mechanisms. Despite the extensive work, a full understanding of the nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is still missing. In the present study we reconsider a theoretical framework based on the heavy quark large mass limit to analyse the radiative decays of heavy quarkonia, in particular the electric dipole transitions of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ to S-wave charmonia. The results favourably compare to recent measurements for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, obtained by the LHCb Collaboration, if this meson is identified with $\chi_{c1}(2P)$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Seesaw Mechanism and Axion Portal Fermionic Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) that addresses both the smallness of neutrino masses and the dark matter (DM) puzzle via the inverse seesaw mechanism and an axion portal fermionic DM. This model generates light neutrino masses without requiring high energy scales, enhancing its testability in future collider experiments. An axion-like particle (ALP) connects the SM and DM sectors, yielding a distinct phenomenology. Our analysis shows that the model is consistent with constraints from neutrino oscillations and DM relic density as well as satisfying the current measurement on muon $g-2$. This work offers a unified framework to address neutrino masses and DM, with implications for particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Isospin sum rules for bottom-baryon weak decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry, as the most precise flavor symmetry, can be used to extract information about hadronic dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian operators of bottom quark weak decays are zero under a series of isospin lowering operators $I_-^n$, which permits us to generate isospin sum rules without the Wigner-Eckart invariants. In this work, we derive hundreds of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays of bottom baryons. They provide hints for new decay modes and the isospin partners of pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Hunting for a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a set of precision observables that can probe the existence of a light particle $X$ coupled to electrons in the mass range of 1--100 MeV. As a case study, we consider the recent excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events at $\sqrt{s} = 16.9$ MeV reported by the PADME collaboration. Interestingly, this mass is tantalizingly close to the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states by the ATOMKI collaboration. For the scenario in which the new particle has a vector coupling to electrons, we show that the PADME excess is already in tension with constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the non-observation of the exotic pion and muon decays $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu X$ and $\mu^+ \to e^+ \bar\nu_\mu\nu_e X$ at the SINDRUM experiment. Further improvements in the measurement of the electron $g$-2, together with upcoming results from the Mu3e and PIONEER experiments, are expected to definitively probe this scenario in the near future. We also explore alternative possibilities where the new particle has scalar, pseudoscalar, or axial-vector couplings.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>

Abstract: The limits on lepton radii and contact interaction scales are used to derive limits on the deviations of lepton anomalous magnetic dipole moments (g-2)/2 from the Standard Model predictions. In the case of quadratic dependence of the deviations on the lepton mass the limits for electrons are better compared to low energy measurements, for muons somewhat weaker than the latest precision experiments, and for taus by far the best.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Quark Matter in Massive Quark Stars</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high baryon densities (\(\rho_B\)) in quark stars (QSs). The QS model is based on the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) framework, modified (MDDQM) by enhancing the single-gluon interaction to generate higher repulsive pressure. The model parameters are constrained using Bayesian inference, incorporating observational data from the pulsars HESS J1731$-$347, PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, and PSR J0952$-$0607. Our results show that the MDDQM model produces QSs with higher mass and compactness compared to the DDQM model. Among the four MDDQM parameterizations studied, two yield maximum star masses of 1.86 and 2.10 \(\rm M_\odot\) and exhibit near-conformal behavior in the underlying quark matter (QM). The other two parameterizations, yielding QS masses of 2.30 and 2.37 \(\rm M_\odot\), correspond to a stronger interaction in the underlying QM. These findings provide important insights into the equation of state of deconfined QM and its implications for the structure and stability of QSs.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Curvature Perturbation and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field sufficiently dominates the energy density of the universe before its decay. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is negative, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to gravitational wave emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 20 within a 4 yr observation run, if all dark matter is made up of $\sim30{\rm\,M}_\odot$ PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Epoch of Reionization Signal with 3D U-Net Neural Networks Using Data-driven Systematic Effect Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images in South Celestial Pole (SCP) field and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole (NCP) field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression (GPR), and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1752 hours of integration time, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal noise and excess variances with observations up to 4380 hours and 13140 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively. The incoherence of excess variances in the frequency direction can greatly affect deep learning to extract 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Heavy Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a magnetic field on the running coupling constant for a heavy-quark model in a bottom-up holographic approach. To achieve this, we employ a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton background that captures the essential features of heavy quark dynamics. Similar to the light-quark model, the running coupling $\alpha$ for heavy quarks decreases in the presence of a strong external magnetic field at fixed temperature and chemical potential. The key distinction between the light and heavy quark models lies in the locations of their respective phase transitions. However, near the 1st order phase transitions, the behavior of $\alpha$ is analogous for both cases: $\alpha$ exhibits jumps that depend on temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <title>Kaon-meson coupling from SU(3) flavour symmetry and application to antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron stars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, creating a favourable environment for the appearance of exotic states, such as strange and non-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we investigate these interactions by, for the first time, employing SU(3) flavor symmetry to study antikaon condensation in dense matter. We determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>

      <title>Resonances in Lifetimes of AdS Oscillon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>

      <title>Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards as a Robust Test on Late-Time Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an assumption-minimized framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-time biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM \citep{DESI:2025zgx}, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case, suggesting the presence of pre-recombination physics or systematics that likely affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlight the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>
