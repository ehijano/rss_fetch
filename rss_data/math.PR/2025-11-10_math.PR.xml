      <title>Uniform dimension theorems for parabolic SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following $p$-dimensional system of It\^o type stochastic PDEs, \begin{align*}\left[\begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_t u(t\,,x) = \partial^2_x u(t\,,x) + b(u(t\,,x)) + \sigma(u(t\,,x)) \xi(t\,,x)\\ &amp;\text{for $(t\,,x)\in(0\,,\infty)\times\mathbb{T}$, subject to $u(0) \equiv u_0$ on $\mathbb{T}$}, \end{aligned}\right.\end{align*} where $\mathbb{T}$ denotes a given one-dimensional torus, the initial data $u_0:\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}^p$ is assumed to be fixed and non-random and in $C^{1/2}(\mathbb{T}\,;\mathbb{R}^p)$, and $\xi$ denotes a $p$-dimensional space-time white noise. Under certain regularity conditions on $b$ and $\sigma$, it is proved that, if $p \ge 4$, then \begin{equation*} \mathrm{P}\{\operatorname{dim_{_H}} u(\{t\}\times F) = 2\operatorname{dim_{_H}} F \ \text{$\forall$compact $F\subset\mathbb{T}$, $t&gt;0$}\}=1. \end{equation*} If in addition the matrix $\sigma(v)$ does not depend on $v\in\mathbb{R}^p$, and is nonsingular, then the above equality holds for all $p\ge2$.</description>

      <title>Hitting Time Distributions of Random Walks on Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hitting times of random walks on graphs, where a hitting time is defined as the number of steps required for a random walker to move from one node to another. While much of the existing literature focuses on calculating or bounding expected hitting times, this approach is insufficient, as hitting time distributions often exhibit high variance. To address this gap, we analyze both the full distributions and variances of hitting times. Using general Markov chain techniques, as well as Fourier and spectral methods, we derive formulas and recurrence relations for computing these distributions. This is a preliminary work, and some results are being refined. A journal version will be available soon.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic expansion of the norm of $e^{-|{t-s}|}{1}_{\{0\le s,t\le T\}}$ in the canonical Hilbert space of fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the inner product formula of the canonical Hilbert space of fractional Brownian motion on an interval $[0,T]$ with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$ given by Alazemi et al., we show the asymptotic expansion of the norm of $f_T(s,t):=e^{-|t-s|}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\le s,t\le T\}}$ up to the term $T^{4H-4}$. As applications, we show that the existence of the oblique asymptote of the norm $\frac12\|f_T\|^2_{{\mathfrak{H}}^{\otimes2}}$ if and only if $H\in (0,\frac12]$ and that we obtain a sharp upper bound of the difference $\left|\frac{1}{2 {T}} \|f_T\|_{\mathfrak{H}^{\otimes 2}}^2-\sigma^2\right|$ for $H\in (0,\frac34)$ which implies two significant estimates concerning to an ergodic fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where $\sigma^2$ is the slope of the oblique asymptote.</description>

      <title>Kac's Program and Relative Entropy Decay for Nonlinear Spin-Exchange Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a nonlinear exchange dynamics for Ising spin systems with arbitrary interactions. The evolution is governed by a quadratic Boltzmann-type equation that conserves the mean magnetization. Collisions are encoded through a spin-exchange kernel chosen so that the dynamics converge to the Ising model with the prescribed interaction and mean magnetization profile determined by the initial state. We prove a general convergence theorem, valid for any interaction and any transport kernel. Moreover, we show that, for sufficiently weak interactions, the system relaxes exponentially fast to equilibrium in relative entropy, with optimal decay rate independent of the initial condition. The proof relies on establishing a strong version of the Kac program from kinetic theory. In particular, we show that the associated Kac particle system satisfies a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constants uniform in the number of particles. This is achieved by adapting the method of stochastic localization to the present conservative setting.</description>

      <title>Multitime fields and hard rod scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Poisson line process is a random set of straight lines contained in the plane, as the image of the map $(x,v)\mapsto (x+vt)_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$, for each point $(x,v)$ of a Poisson process in the space-velocity plane. By associating a step with each line of the process, a random surface called multitime walk field is obtained. The diffusive rescaling of the surface converges to the multitime Brownian motion, a classical Gaussian field also called L\'evy-Chentsov field. A cut of the multitime fields with a perpendicular plane, reveals a one dimensional continuous time random walk and a Brownian motion, respectively.
  A hard rod is an interval contained in $\mathbb{R}$ that travels ballistically until it collides with another hard rod, at which point they interchange positions. By associating each line with the ballistic displacement of a hard rod and associating surface steps with hard rod jumps, we obtain the hydrodynamic limits of the hard rods in the Euler and diffusive scalings. The main tools are law of large numbers and central limit theorems for Poisson processes.
  When rod sizes are zero we have an ideal gas dynamics. We describe the relation between ideal gas and hard-rod invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Uniform pathwise stability of additive singular SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to a class of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1)$. The drift consists of a dissipative Lipschitz term and a singular term of regularity $\gamma &gt;1-1/(2H)$ in Besov-H\"older scales. Well-posedness and existence of an invariant measure are established. If the singular contribution is sufficiently small, we prove that the invariant measure is unique. Our methods rely on uniform pathwise estimates which combine together the dissipativity of the drift and the regularisation effect of the noise.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the from $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove the central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions and compute the subleading correction to the free energy. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'].
  Our results allow us to give a large $N$ expansion up to $o(N)$ of the log-volume of the unit balls of $N\times N$ self-adjoint matrices for the $p$-Schatten norms and to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture. For the latter, we consider the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$ and the uniform distributions on these same Schatten balls for $N$ large enough. While the case $p&gt;3$, $r=2, q=1$ was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $r\geq1$, $q\geq1$. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Riemannian Metrics From Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random geometric graphs are random graph models defined on metric measure spaces. A random geometric graph is generated by first sampling points from a metric space and then connecting each pair of sampled points independently with a probability that depends on their distance.
  In recent work of Huang, Jiradilok, and Mossel~\cite{HJM24}, the authors study the problem of reconstructing an embedded manifold form a random geometric graph sampled from the manifold, where edge probabilities depend monotonically on the Euclidean distance between the embedded points. They show that, under mild regularity assumptions on the manifold, the sampling measure, and the connection probability function, it is possible to recover the pairwise Euclidean distances of the embedded sampled points up to a vanishing error as the number of vertices grows.
  In this work we consider a similar and arguably more natural problem where the metric is the Riemannian metric on the manifold. Again points are sampled from the manifold and a random graph is generated where the connection probability is monotone in the Riemannian distance. Perhaps surprisingly we obtain stronger results in this setup.
  Unlike the previous work that only considered dense graph we provide reconstruction algorithms from sparse graphs with average degree $n^{1/2}{\rm polylog}(n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Our algorithm is also a more efficient algorithm for distance reconstruction with improved error bounds. The running times of the algorithm is
  $O(n^2\,{\rm polylog}(n))$ which up to polylog factor matches the size of the input graph.
  Our distance error also nearly matches the volumetric lower bounds for distance estimation.</description>

      <title>Partially exchangeable Markov chains and characterisation of multitype Lambda-coalescents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study consistent and partially exchangeable sequences of Markov chains on a finite state space. We provide a characterisation of the admissible transition rates via a decomposition into individual and coordinated motion of particles. As a consequence, we find a characterisation of multitype Lambda-coalescents with multiple switches. Moreover, we provide convergence and duality results for the corresponding process of limiting relative frequencies that we call the de Finetti measure process, and discuss a number of examples from the recent literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization on Spherical Surfaces: Continuous and Discrete Models - A Beginner-Friendly Expository Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This expository paper provides a unified and pedagogical introduction to optimal quantization for probability measures supported on spherical surfaces, emphasizing both continuous and discrete settings. We first present a detailed geometric and analytical foundation of quantization on the unit sphere, including definitions of great and small circles, spherical triangles, geodesic distance, Slerp interpolation, the Fr\'echet mean, spherical Voronoi regions, centroid conditions, and quantization dimensions. Building upon this framework, we develop explicit continuous and discrete quantization models on spherical curves -great circles, small circles, and great circular arcs -supported by rigorous derivations and pedagogical exposition. For uniform continuous distributions, we compute optimal sets of $n$-means and the associated quantization errors on these curves; for discrete distributions, we analyze antipodal, equatorial, tetrahedral, and finite uniform configurations, illustrating convergence to the continuous model. The central conclusion is that for a uniform probability distribution supported on a one-dimensional geodesic subset of total length $L$, the optimal $n$-means form a uniform partition and the quantization error satisfies $V_n = L^2/(12n^2)$. The exposition emphasizes geometric intuition, detailed derivations, and clear step-by-step reasoning, making it accessible to beginning graduate students and researchers entering the study of quantization on manifolds.</description>

      <title>Confidentiality in a Card-Based Protocol Under Repeated Biased Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a probabilistic analysis of the confidentiality in a card-based protocol. We focus on Bert den Boer's original Five Card Trick to develop our approach. Five Card Trick was formulated as a secure two-party computation method, where two players use colored cards with identical backs to calculate the logical AND operation on the bits that they choose. In this method, the players first arrange the cards privately, and then shuffle them through a random cut. Finally, they reveal the shuffled arrangement to determine the result of the operation. An unbiased random cut is essential to prevent players from exposing their chosen bits to each other. However, players typically choose to move cards within the deck even though not moving any cards should be equally likely. This unconscious behavior results in a biased, nonuniform shuffling-distribution in the sense that some arrangements of cards are slightly more probable after the cut. Such a nonuniform distribution creates an opportunity for a malicious player to gain advantage in guessing the other player's choice. We provide the conditional probabilities of such guesses as a way to quantify the information leakage. Furthermore, we utilize the eigenstructure of a Markov chain to derive tight bounds on the number of times the biased random cuts must be repeated to reduce the leakage to an acceptable level. We also discuss the generalization of our approach to the setting where shuffling is conducted by a malicious player.</description>

      <title>The law of iterated logarithm for numerical approximation of time-homogeneous Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the time-homogeneous Markov process with a unique invariant measure characterizes the almost sure maximum possible fluctuation of time averages around the ergodic limit. Whether a numerical approximation can preserve this asymptotic pathwise behavior remains an open problem. In this work, we give a positive answer to this question and establish the LIL for the numerical approximation of such a process under verifiable assumptions. The Markov process is discretized by a decreasing time-step strategy, which yields the non-homogeneous numerical approximation but facilitates a martingale-based analysis. The key ingredient in proving the LIL for such numerical approximation lies in extracting a quasi-uniform time-grid subsequence from the original non-uniform time grids and establishing the LIL for a predominant martingale along it, while the remainder terms converge to zero. Finally, we illustrate that our results can be flexibly applied to numerical approximations of a broad class of stochastic systems, including SODEs and SPDEs.</description>

      <title>On the Color Discrepancy of Spanning Trees in Random and Randomly Perturbed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the color discrepancy of spanning trees in random graphs. We show that for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ with $p$ above the connectivity threshold, the following holds with high probability: in every 2-edge-coloring of the graph, there exists a spanning tree with a linear number of leaves such that one color class contains more than $\frac{1 + \varepsilon}{2}n $ of the tree's edges. Here, $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small absolute constant independent of $p$.
  We also extend this line of research to randomly perturbed dense graphs, showing that adding a few random edges to a dense graph typically creates a spanning tree with a large color discrepancy under any 2-edge-coloring.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution of numerical methods for parabolic SPDEs with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the asymptotic error distribution of several numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise. Firstly, we give the limit distribution of the normalized error process of the exponential Euler method in $\dot{H}^\eta$ for some $\eta&gt;0$. A key finding is that the asymptotic error in distribution of the exponential Euler method is governed by a linear SPDE driven by infinitely many independent $Q$-Wiener processes. This characteristic represents a significant difference from numerical methods for both stochastic ordinary differential equations and SPDEs with additive noise. Secondly, as applications of the above result, we derive the asymptotic error distribution of a full discretization based on the temporal exponential Euler method and the spatial finite element method. As a concrete illustration, we provide the pointwise limit distribution of the normalized error process when the exponential Euler method is applied to a specific class of stochastic heat equations. Finally, by studying the asymptotic error of the spatial semi-discrete spectral Galerkin method, we demonstrate that the actual strong convergence speed of spatial semi-discrete numerical methods may be highly problem-dependent, rather than universally predictable.</description>

Abstract: These lecture notes give an introduction to the theory of interacting particle systems. The main subjects are the construction using generators and graphical representations, the mean field limit, stochastic order, duality, and the relation to oriented percolation. An attempt is made to give a large number of examples beyond the classical voter, contact and Ising processes and to illustrate these based on numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>

      <title>The geometry of coalescing random walks, the Brownian web distance and KPZ universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalescing simple random walks in the plane form an infinite tree. A natural directed distance on this tree is given by the number of jumps between branches when one is only allowed to move in one direction. The Brownian web distance is the scale-invariant limit of this directed metric. It is integer-valued and has scaling exponents 0:1:2 as compared to 1:2:3 in the KPZ world. However, we show that the shear limit of the Brownian web distance is still given by the Airy process. We conjecture that our limit theorem can be extended to the full directed landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decay property of a special class of $d$-dimensional Markov processes, which can be viewed as a stopped network with the external customer being blocked to empty nodes. The exact value of the decay parameter $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$ is obtained by using a new method. It is proved that the process is $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$-transient. The corresponding $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$-invariant measures and quasi-distributions are also presented. Finally, an example on auto quick repair service network is presented to illustrate the results obtained in this paper.</description>

      <title>Ultra high order cumulants and quantitative CLT for polynomials in Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the study of the high order freeness of random matrices, it is known that the order $r$ cumulant of the trace of a polynomial of $N$-dimensional GUE/GOE is of order $N^{2-r}$ if $r$ is fixed. In this work, we extend the study along three directions. First, we also consider generally distributed Wigner matrices with subexponential entries. Second, we include the deterministic matrices into discussion and consider arbitrary polynomials in random matrices and deterministic matrices. Third, more importantly, we consider the ultra high order cumulants in the sense that $r$ is arbitrary, i.e., could be $N$ dependent. Our main results are the upper bounds of the ultra high order cumulants, for which not only the $N$-dependence but also the $r$-dependence become significant. These results are then used to derive three types of quantitative CLT for the trace of any given self-adjoint polynomial in these random matrix variables: a CLT with a Cram\'{e}r type correction, a Berry-Esseen bound, and a concentration inequality which captures both the Gaussian tail in the small deviation regime and $M$-dependent tail in the large deviation regime, where $M$ is the degree of the polynomial. In contrast to the second order freeness which implies the CLT for linear eigenvalue statistics of polynomials in random matrices, our study on the ultra high order cumulants leads to the quantitative versions of the CLT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate variance bounds under symmetry constraints in classical, free, and Boolean probability, focusing on Bernoulli distributions and their noncommutative analogues, projections with trace \(p\). We show that symmetrizers under classical, free, and Boolean convolution satisfy a sharp variance bound of \(pq\), with equality for the reflection law. Additionally, we highlight phenomena specific to Boolean convolution, demonstrating that non-symmetric measures can produce symmetric convolutions and that symmetrizers may be non-unique for certain measures. These results unify variance inequalities across probabilistic frameworks and offer insights for quantum information and noncommutative stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Patching: A Geometric Construction of Quasi-Sure Solutions to G-SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a geometric approach to constructing quasi-sure solutions for $G$-stochastic differential equations (G-SDEs) under model uncertainty. We propose a pathwise patching methodology that systematically combines measure-specific solutions into a unified, universally measurable process. The construction relies on pathwise uniqueness and the convex structure of the $G$-expectation framework to ensure compatibility across different probability measures.
  We further investigate the possibility of developing a robust Malliavin calculus within this framework. By reformulating the Malliavin derivative through variational equations that inherit the quasi-sure structure, we attempt to overcome the challenges posed by traditional $L^2$-closure arguments in multi-measure settings.
  While our approach offers enhanced geometric intuition and a potentially more transparent foundation for stochastic analysis under model uncertainty, we recognize its limitations and the need for further investigation into its full scope and applicability. The results may have implications for robust financial mathematics and stochastic control, though we present them as a preliminary step toward more comprehensive theories.</description>

      <title>Free energy fluctuations in SK and related spin glass models: A literature survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, spin glass models have generated a broad range of literature in mathematics, physics, and computer science. There has been much progress in characterizing and proving the limiting free energy of various models, stemming from the original formulas of Parisi. Comparatively less is known about the more detailed topic of free energy fluctuations. This paper concerns a family of models in which there has been considerable progress on fluctuations, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) and spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) models, along with their multi-species analogs. We present a survey of the literature on free energy fluctuations in these 2-spin models, discussing results from different temperature regimes, with and without an external field, including results on phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A Renormalisation Group Map for Short- and Long-ranged Weakly Coupled $|\varphi|^4$ Models in $d \ge 4$ at and Above the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct and analyse a renormalisation group (RG) map for the weakly coupled $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model under periodic boundary conditions in dimension $d \ge 4$. Both short-range and long-range interactions with upper critical dimension four are considered. This extends and refines the RG map constructed by Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade for the short-range model at $d=4$. This extension opens the door to establishing the exact decay rate of correlation functions of all of the models discussed. Furthermore, incorporating a large-field decay estimate and comparing with the finite-size scaling results of Michta, Park, and Slade, our analysis provides strong evidence for the emergence of a plateau in systems of finite volume with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $ \psi$ and $\varphi $ verifying some mild assumptions, there exists a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $ \varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $ \psi$-packing measure on $ K$ are both finite and positive. Such examples are then embedded in any infinite dimensional Banach space to answer positively a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Theory for High-Dimensional Rank One Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a pseudo-likelihood theory for rank one matrix estimation problems in the high dimensional limit. We prove a variational principle for the limiting pseudo-maximum likelihood which also characterizes the performance of the corresponding pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator. We show that this variational principle is universal and depends only on four parameters determined by the corresponding null model. Through this universality, we introduce a notion of equivalence for estimation problems of this type and, in particular, show that a broad class of estimation tasks, including community detection, sparse submatrix detection, and non-linear spiked matrix models, are equivalent to spiked matrix models. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the performance of the least-squares (or ``best rank one'') estimator for any rank one matrix estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game of Controls with State Reflections: Existence and Limit Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies mean field game (MFG) of controls by featuring the joint distribution of the state and the control with the reflected state process along an exogenous stochastic reflection boundary. We contribute to the literature with a customized relaxed formulation and some new compactification arguments to establish the existence of a Markovian mean field equilibrium (MFE) in the weak sense. We consider an enlarged canonical space, utilizing the dynamic Skorokhod mapping, to accommodate the stochastic reflection boundary process. A fixed-point argument on the extended space using an extension transformation technique is developed to tackle challenges from the joint measure flow of the state and the relaxed control that may not be continuous. Furthermore, the bidirectional connections between the MFG and the $N$-player game are established in the context of joint law dependence and state reflections. We first show that any weak limit of empirical measures induced by $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in $N$-player games must be supported exclusively on the set of relaxed mean field equilibria, analogous to the propagation of chaos in mean field control problems. We then prove the convergence result that a Markovian MFE in the weak sense can be approximated by a sequence of constructed $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in the weak sense in $N$-player games when $N$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent equations and quantum diffusion for the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson tight-binding model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, with Gaussian noise and at low disorder $\lambda&gt;0$. We derive a diffusive scaling limit for the entries of the resolvent $R(z)$ at imaginary part $\operatorname*{Im} z\sim\lambda^{2+\kappa_d}$, $\kappa_d&gt;0$, with high probability. As consequences, we establish quantum diffusion (in a time-averaged sense) for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator at the longest timescale known to date and improve the best available lower bounds on the localization length of eigenfunctions. Our results for $d=2$ are the first quantum diffusion results for the Anderson model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The proof avoids the use of diagrammatic expansions and instead proceeds by analyzing certain self-consistent equations for $R(z)$. This is facilitated by new estimates for $\|R(z)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q}$ that control the recollisions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictions from statistical physics postulate that recovery of the communities in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This conjecture has given rise to a rich literature, proving that non-trivial community recovery is indeed possible in SBM above the KS threshold, as long as the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the observed graph. Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\sqrt{n})$.
  When $K\geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This breakthrough result lead them to postulate a new threshold for the many communities regime $K\geq \sqrt{n}$. In this work, we provide evidences that confirm their conjecture for $K\geq \sqrt{n}$:
  1- We prove that, for any density of the graph, low-degree polynomials fail to recover communities below the threshold postulated by Chin et al.(2025);
  2- We prove that community recovery is possible in polynomial time above the postulated threshold, not only in the sparse regime of~Chin et al., but also in some (but not all) moderately sparse regimes by essentially by counting occurrences of cliques or self-avoiding paths of suitable size in the observed graph.
  In addition, we propose a detailed conjecture regarding the structure of motifs that are optimal in sparsity regimes not covered by cliques or self-avoiding paths counting. In particular, counting self-avoiding paths of length $\log(n)$--which is closely related to spectral algorithms based on the Non-Backtracking operator--is optimal only in the sparse regime. Other motif counts--unrelated to spectral properties--should be considered in denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Spectral results for free random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\mathrm{tr})$ be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal trace $\mathrm{tr}:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}.$ For each $a\in\mathcal{A},$ define \[ S(\lambda,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda )+\varepsilon)],\quad\lambda\in\mathbb{C},~\varepsilon&gt;0, \] so that the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^{+}$ of $S$ is the log potential of the Brown measure of $a.$ Suppose that for a fixed $\lambda\in\mathbb{C},$ the function \[ \varepsilon\mapsto\frac{\partial S}{\partial\varepsilon}(\lambda ,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda)+\varepsilon )^{-1}] \] admits a real analytic extension to a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}.$ Then we will show that $\lambda$ is outside the spectrum of $a.$
  We will apply this result to several examples involving circular and elliptic elements, as well as free multiplicative Brownian motions. In most cases, we will show that the spectrum of the relevant element $a$ coincides with the support of its Brown measure.</description>
