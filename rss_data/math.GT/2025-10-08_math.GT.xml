      <title>Khovanov skein lasagna modules with $1$-dimensional inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a variant of Khovanov skein lasagna modules, which takes the Khovanov homology in connected sums of $S^1\times S^2$ defined by Rozansky and Willis as the input link homology. To carry out the construction, we prove functoriality of Rozansky-Willis's homology for cobordisms in a class of $4$-manifolds that we call $4$-dimensional relative $1$-handlebody complements, by using, as a bypass, an isomorphism proved by Sullivan--Zhang relating the Rozansky-Willis homology and the classical Khovanov skein lasagna module of links on the boundary of $D^2\times S^2$. Along the way, we also present new results on diffeomorphism groups, on Gluck twists for Khovanov skein lasagna modules, and on the functoriality of $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any knot $K$ in $S^3$ and any positive rational $r$, we show that smooth $(-r)$-surgery on $K$ always admits a tight contact structure. More specifically, the tightness is detected by the non-vanishing Heegaard Floer contact invariant.</description>

      <title>On absolutely exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exist infinitely many contractible compact smooth $4$-manifolds $C$ that admit absolutely exotic diffeomorphisms of infinite order in $\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}(C))$. By ``absolutely", we mean that isotopies are not required to be relative to the boundary. This follows from a theorem that produces absolutely exotic diffeomorphisms from relatively exotic diffeomorphisms, analogous to a theorem of Akbulut and Ruberman that produces absolutely exotic 4-manifolds from relatively exotic 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress on two closely related sets of questions concerning convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds, or convex domains in those manifolds, such as their convex core. The first set of questions is to what extent the hyperbolic metric on such a manifold is uniquely determined by either of two possible geometric data on their boundary. The second aspect is the ``volume'' associated to such a manifold, such as the renormalized volume of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold. The relation between the two is provided by the first variation of the volume functions, which involves the two kinds of boundary data as ``conjugate'' variables.
  While progress has recently been made on some questions, others remain open. New connections have recently emerged, with physics (and in particular the AdS/CFT correspondence) as well as with probability theory (the Loewner energy).</description>

      <title>Global fixed point in low-dimensional surface group deformation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the natural action of the pure mapping class group of a surface, we show that any global fixed point in the low-dimensional deformation space of the fundamental group of the surface corresponds to the trivial representation, assuming the surface has genus greater than two. This result provides an alternative proof for a special case of a theorem by Landesman and Litt with a slight refinement. We also discuss a similar approach that may potentially lead to an alternative proof of the entirety of the theorem.</description>

      <title>$h$-Principles for smooth curves and knots with prescribed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that smooth curves with prescribed curvature satisfy a $C^1$-dense $h$-principle in the space of immersed curves in Euclidean space. More precisely, every $C^{\alpha \geq 2}$ curve with nonvanishing curvature in $R^{n\geq 3}$ can be $C^1$-approximated by $C^\alpha$ curves of any larger curvature, prescribed as a function of arclength. It follows that there exist $C^\infty$ knots of prescribed curvature in every isotopy class of closed curves embedded in $R^3$.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of CAT(0) spaces: topological freeness and applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study topological dynamics on the visual boundary and several combinatorial boundaries associated to $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ spaces. Through verifying the freeness of Myrberg points on the boundaries, we prove that a large class of these boundary actions are topologically free strong boundary actions. These include certain visual boundary actions obtained from proper isometric actions of groups on proper $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ spaces with rank-one elements, horofunction boundary actions from actions of irreducible finitely generated infinite non-affine Coxeter groups on the Caylay graphs, and Roller-type boundary actions from certain group actions on irreducible $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes. This in particular leads to a new proof of Kar-Sageev's topological freeness result for Roller boundary actions of $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes and generalizes Klisee's topological freeness result on horofunction boundaries from hyperbolic and right angled Coxeter groups to the general case. As applications to $C^*$-algebras, our work yields new examples of $C^*$-selfless groups and of exact, purely infinite, simple reduced crossed product $C^\ast$-algebras.</description>

      <title>The affine geometry of meromorphic connections with irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A meromorphic connection on the tangent bundle of a Riemann surface induces a complex affine structure on the complement of the poles. Local models for Fuchsian singularities are already known. In this paper, we introduce a complete set of local invariants for a meromorphic connection and provide local models for a complex affine structure in a punctured neighborhood of an irregular singularity. Generalizing a construction attributed to Veech, we introduce the Delaunay decomposition of a compact Riemann surface endowed with a meromorphic connection with irregular singularities. In particular, we give upper bounds on the complexity of the decomposition.</description>

      <title>String topology coproduct and Turaev cobracket on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string topology coproduct on the homology of the free loop space of a closed manifold induces a string cobracket on $S^1$-equivariant homology. We give a complete computation of the string topology coproduct for surfaces of higher genus by describing an algorithm which computes the coproduct of a cyclic word in terms of generators of the fundamental group of the surface. We further show that the string cobracket is the negative of the Turaev cobracket.</description>

      <title>How large is the braid monodromy of low-genus Lefschetz fibrations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a genus $g$ smooth Lefschetz fibration $\pi : M \to S^2$ with singular locus $\Delta \subseteq S^2$, we describe the subgroup $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$ of the spherical braid group $\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$ consisting of braids admitting a lift to a fiber-preserving diffeomorphism of $M$. We develop general methods for showing that the index $[\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta) : \operatorname{Br}(\pi)]$ is infinite. As an application of our methods, we prove that $[\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta) : \operatorname{Br}(\pi)] = \infty$ when $g = 1$, when $\pi$ is expressible as a self-fiber sum when $g \geq 2$, or when $\pi$ is a holomorphic genus $g = 2$ Lefschetz fibration whose vanishing cycles are nonseparating. In the genus $g = 1$ case, we relate the subgroup $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$ to the action of $\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$ on the $\operatorname{SL}_2$-character variety for $S^2 \setminus \Delta$ and provide an alternate proof of the first application via recent work of Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <title>Periodic symplectic and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on irrational ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the extension of homologically trivial symplectic or Hamiltonian cyclic actions to Hamiltonian circle actions on irrational ruled symplectic $4$-manifolds. On one hand, we construct symplectic involutions on minimal irrational ruled $4$-manifolds that cannot extend to a symplectic circle action even with a possibly different symplectic form. Higher dimensional examples are also constructed. On the other hand, for homologically trivial symplectic cyclic actions of any other order, we show that such an extension always exists.
  We also classify finite groups of symplecticmorphisms that acts trivially on the first homology group, and prove the non-extendability of the Klein $4$-group action to the three dimensional rotation group action motivated by the classification of finite groups of symplectomorphisms.</description>
