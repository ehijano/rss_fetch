      <title>A ten-year historical analysis of urban PM10 and exceedance filters along the Northern Wasatch Front, UT, USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA) is reducing in size, which raises several ecological concerns, including the effect of an increasing area of dry playa exposed by the retreating lake. This study focuses solely on concerns about the toxicity of metals in the dust blowing off the playa. Although considerable efforts have been made to understand aeolian dust in urban areas along the Wasatch Front, located just east and south of the Great Salt Lake, there is still a need to consolidate existing research and to conduct a compositional analysis of the dust found in these urban areas. We investigated the dust reaching urban monitoring sites around the Great Salt Lake that are managed by the Utah Division of Air Quality. By analyzing historical data, we found that the decrease in the Great Salt Lake's surface area has not led to a statistically significant increase in dust events in urban areas. Windrose plots align with prior research, indicating that heightened dust levels in urban areas coincide with winds originating from the south or west, passing over identified playas and deserts such as the Milford Flats, Sevier Dry Lake, Tule Dry Lake, Great Salt Lake Desert, Dugway Proving Grounds, and the West Desert of Utah. Metallic compositional analysis of urban dust was used to evaluate potential health risks associated with the dust using the hazard quotient, air regional screening levels, and cancer risk methods. This analysis revealed no significant increase in concentrations of toxic metals. However, this is not to preclude a risk of dust-related health concerns, especially due to pre-existing arsenic and lead levels.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Multiplet-Sum Method (MSM) Density-Functional Theory (DFT): II. Completion of the Two-Orbital Two-Electron Model (TOTEM) with an Application to the Avoided Crossing in Lithium Hydride (LiH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ziegler-Rauk-Baerends multiplet sum method (MSM) assumes that density-functional theory (DFT) provides a good description of states dominated by a single determinant. It then uses symmetry to add static correlation to DFT. In our previous article (Article I) [J. Chem. Phys. 159, 244306 (2023)], we introduced diagrammatic MSM-DFT as a tool to aid in extending MSM-DFT to include the nondynamic correlation needed for making and breaking bonds even in the absence of symmetry. An attractive feature of this approach is that no functional-dependent parameters need to be introduced, though choices are needed in making correspondances between wave function theory (WFT) and MSM-DFT diagrams. The preliminary examples in Article I used the two-orbital two-electron model (TOTEM) less completely than could have been the case. Diagrammatic MSM-DFT is extended here to treat the full TOTEM and it is shown that the unsymmetric lithium hydride (LiH) molecule dissociates into neutral atoms when diagrammatic MSM-DFT techniques are used to introduce a proper description of the avoided crossing between ionic bonding and covalent bonding states.The method is tested for Hartree-Fock and for three functionals (LDA, PW91, and B3LYP). All the functionals yield similar results as should be expected for a properly-formulated parameter-free theory. Agreement with available estimates show that the magnitude of the coupling element introduced here is excellent. However more work will be needed to obtain quantitative agreement between our diagrammatic MSM-DFT ground-state potential energy curve and that found from high-quality ab initio calculations</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity increases transition path probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining low-dimensional reaction coordinates is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems and for comparison with experiments. The maximal value of the transition-path probability along the reaction coordinate $x$, $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$, is a common estimator for reaction-coordinate quality by comparing to the theoretical maximal value of 1/2 in the overdamped Markovian limit. We show by analytical arguments and simulations that for non-Markovian dynamics $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ is non-monotonic as a function of the memory time and exceeds 1/2 for long memory time. This disqualifies $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ as a criterion for reaction coordinate quality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning of Molecular Energies with Hybrid Quantum-Neural Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.</description>

      <title>Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone to Global Warming in the Last Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports observations of regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface temperature, as well as various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE). We strikingly found warming trends of 0.77(+/-0.57) and 0.69(+/-0.22) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since 2002. These UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing and no significant trends in total GHG effect in polar and non-polar regions respectively. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of surface cooling trends in both the Antarctic since 2005 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which causes the recent rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST). These temperature changing patterns are consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction (CRE) mechanism of halogen-containing GHGs (halo-GHGs) with larger destruction rates at higher latitudes. Moreover, the no-parameter physics model of warming caused by halo-GHGs reproduces closely the observed GMSTs from 2000 to 2024, including the almost no warming during 2000-2012 and the significant warming by 0.2-0.3 deg C during 2013-2023, of which 0.27 deg C was calculated to arise from the net radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The results also show that the physics model captures 76% of the variance in the observed GMSTs, exhibiting a warming peak in October 2023 and predicting a gradual GMST reversal thereafter. The results from this study may greatly improve our understanding of global climate change and lead to the identifying of the correct major culprit for human contribution to changing the climate.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of ions from aqueous solutions by ferroelectric nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel methods and technology drive the rapid advances of nuclear magnetic resonance. The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to improve sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation has made NMR much more convenient to use than before, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms without regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and SNR as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei on three devices. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer (Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of RG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from supposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7 and 9.4 T spectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal showed the expected approximately linear increase with RG, but we found an unexpected, drastic drop of SNR for X-nuclei: For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar to that at a maximum RG of 101, the obtained SNR was 46% higher than at RG = 20.2. These unexpected results suggest that NMR users may want to calibrate spectrometer settings to obtain the optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics. In this context, we provide a method to estimate optimal settings for thermally and hyperpolarized samples of a chosen concentration, polarization, and flip angle, which provide a high SNR and avoid ADC-overflow artifacts.</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with pre-defined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. This paper introduces a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create restraining potential "cliffs" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a preset area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>
