      <title>LLM2Rec: Large Language Models Are Powerful Embedding Models for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation.

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Dense Retrievers in Interdisciplinary Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.</description>

      <title>PentaRAG: Large-Scale Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval for Enterprise LLM Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise deployments of large-language model (LLM) demand continuously changing document collections with sub-second latency and predictable GPU cost requirements that classical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines only partially satisfy. We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each query through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a memory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session memory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with Mistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or semantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full retrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined with the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and factual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a nine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from several seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast paths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to 0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and sustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on our setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can deliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG systems.</description>

      <title>SERP Interference Network and Its Applications in Search Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search Engine marketing teams in the e-commerce industry manage global search engine traffic to their websites with the aim to optimize long-term profitability by delivering the best possible customer experience on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). In order to do so, they need to run continuous and rapid Search Marketing A/B tests to continuously evolve and improve their products. However, unlike typical e-commerce A/B tests that can randomize based on customer identification, their tests face the challenge of anonymized users on search engines. On the other hand, simply randomizing on products violates Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption for most treatments of interest. In this work, we propose leveraging censored observational data to construct bipartite (Search Query to Product Ad or Text Ad) SERP interference networks. Using a novel weighting function, we create weighted projections to form unipartite graphs which can then be use to create clusters to randomized on. We demonstrate this experimental design's application in evaluating a new bidding algorithm for Paid Search. Additionally, we provide a blueprint of a novel system architecture utilizing SageMaker which enables polyglot programming to implement each component of the experimental framework.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Patch Compression for ColPali: Efficient Multi-Vector Document Retrieval with Dynamic Pruning and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to 32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments. Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\% lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.</description>

      <title>Evaluating VisualRAG: Quantifying Cross-Modal Performance in Enterprise Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian-Guided Diversity in Sequential Sampling for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation settings.</description>

      <title>DCN^2: Interplay of Implicit Collision Weights and Explicit Cross Layers for Large-Scale Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives, such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs' behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four publicly available benchmark data sets.</description>

      <title>IRanker: Towards Ranking Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.</description>

      <title>HyReC: Exploring Hybrid-based Retriever for Chinese</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ARAG: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Personalized Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.</description>

      <title>CAL-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent Generation for Content-Aware Layout Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness, element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.</description>

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress, yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty evaluation.</description>

      <title>Reward Balancing Revisited: Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a prevalent and effective methodology for real-world recommender systems, enabling learning policies from historical data and capturing user preferences. In offline RL, reward shaping encounters significant challenges, with past efforts to incorporate prior strategies for uncertainty to improve world models or penalize underexplored state-action pairs. Despite these efforts, a critical gap remains: the simultaneous balancing of intrinsic biases in world models and the diversity of policy recommendations. To address this limitation, we present an innovative offline RL framework termed Reallocated Reward for Recommender Systems (R3S). By integrating inherent model uncertainty to tackle the intrinsic fluctuations in reward predictions, we boost diversity for decision-making to align with a more interactive paradigm, incorporating extra penalizers with decay that deter actions leading to diminished state variety at both local and global scales. The experimental results demonstrate that R3S improves the accuracy of world models and efficiently harmonizes the heterogeneous preferences of the users.</description>

      <title>UiS-IAI@LiveRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Information Nugget-Based Generation of Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) faces challenges related to factual correctness, source attribution, and response completeness. The LiveRAG Challenge hosted at SIGIR'25 aims to advance RAG research using a fixed corpus and a shared, open-source LLM. We propose a modular pipeline that operates on information nuggets-minimal, atomic units of relevant information extracted from retrieved documents. This multistage pipeline encompasses query rewriting, passage retrieval and reranking, nugget detection and clustering, cluster ranking and summarization, and response fluency enhancement. This design inherently promotes grounding in specific facts, facilitates source attribution, and ensures maximum information inclusion within length constraints. In this challenge, we extend our focus to also address the retrieval component of RAG, building upon our prior work on multi-faceted query rewriting. Furthermore, for augmented generation, we concentrate on improving context curation capabilities, maximizing the breadth of information covered in the response while ensuring pipeline efficiency. Our results show that combining original queries with a few sub-query rewrites boosts recall, while increasing the number of documents used for reranking and generation beyond a certain point reduces effectiveness, without improving response quality.</description>

      <title>JointRank: Rank Large Set with Single Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Listwise rerankers, which improve relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited in practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality when processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast reranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first partitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked independently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from these local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a global ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on TREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the 57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context model, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds.
  The implementation of the algorithm and the experiments is available in the repository: https://github.com/V3RGANz/jointrank</description>

      <title>Education-Oriented Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Learning Path Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning path recommendation seeks to provide learners with a structured sequence of learning items (e.g., knowledge concepts or exercises) to optimize their learning efficiency. Despite significant efforts in this area, most existing methods primarily rely on prerequisite relationships, which present two major limitations: 1) Many educational datasets do not explicitly provide prerequisite relationships between knowledge concepts, hindering the application of current learning path recommendation methods. 2) Relying solely on prerequisite relationships as the sole knowledge structure can impede learning progress and negatively impact student outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, Discrimination Learning Enhances Learning Path Recommendation (DLELP), which enhances learning path recommendations by incorporating both prerequisite and similarity relationships between knowledge concepts. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge concept structure graph generation module that adaptively constructs knowledge concept structure graphs for different educational datasets, significantly improving the generalizability of learning path recommendation methods. We then propose a Discrimination Learning-driven Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) framework, which mitigates the issue of blocked learning paths, further enhancing the efficacy of learning path recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also provides interpretable reasoning for the recommended learning paths.</description>

      <title>HLTCOE at LiveRAG: GPT-Researcher using ColBERT retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HLTCOE LiveRAG submission utilized the GPT-researcher framework for researching the context of the question, filtering the returned results, and generating the final answer. The retrieval system was a ColBERT bi-encoder architecture, which represents a passage with many dense tokens. Retrieval used a local, compressed index of the FineWeb10-BT collection created with PLAID-X, using a model fine-tuned for multilingual retrieval. Query generation from context was done with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, while filtering was accomplished with m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval. Up to nine passages were used as context to generate an answer using Falcon3-10B. This system placed 5th in the LiveRAG automatic evaluation for correctness with a score of 1.07.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Rankings: Leveraging LLMs for Gender Bias Detection and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking. Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures, leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities. Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area. Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.</description>

      <title>ADNet: Leveraging Error-Bias Towards Normal Direction in Face Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05721v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>FreeEnricher: Enriching Face Landmarks without Additional Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of LLM-based Strategies for the Extraction of Food Product Information from Online Shops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, $-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Educational Textbook Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work, we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of ClinIQLink, a shared task, collocated with the 24th BioNLP workshop at ACL 2025, designed to stress-test large language models (LLMs) on medically-oriented question answering aimed at the level of a General Practitioner. The challenge supplies 4,978 expert-verified, medical source-grounded question-answer pairs that cover seven formats: true/false, multiple choice, unordered list, short answer, short-inverse, multi-hop, and multi-hop-inverse. Participating systems, bundled in Docker or Apptainer images, are executed on the CodaBench platform or the University of Maryland's Zaratan cluster. An automated harness (Task 1) scores closed-ended items by exact match and open-ended items with a three-tier embedding metric. A subsequent physician panel (Task 2) audits the top model responses.</description>

      <title>Structured Attention Matters to Multimodal LLMs in Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content, directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question answering performance across diverse document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.</description>

      <title>AdaptGOT: A Pre-trained Model for Adaptive Contextual POI Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI) embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific, end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation, which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based, importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.</description>

      <title>Refine Medical Diagnosis Using Generation Augmented Retrieval and Clinical Practice Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs), typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records (EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis. Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics, demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong potential for broader clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Doc2SAR: A Synergistic Framework for High-Fidelity Extraction of Structure-Activity Relationships from Scientific Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.</description>

      <title>DAPFAM: A Domain-Aware Patent Retrieval Dataset Aggregated at the Family Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level. The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336 full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments (forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional, requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now the access link is this repository: https://osf.io/vbyzd/?view_only=1a40242e0d1941a58aa854af3e50cf6b).</description>

      <title>The Missing Link: Joint Legal Citation Prediction using Heterogeneous Graph Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal systems heavily rely on cross-citations of legal norms as well as previous court decisions. Practitioners, novices and legal AI systems need access to these relevant data to inform appraisals and judgments. We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative capabilities across diverse domains. The field of patent analysis and innovation is not an exception, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques presents opportunities to streamline and enhance important tasks -- such as patent classification and patent retrieval -- in the patent cycle. This not only accelerates the efficiency of patent researchers and applicants, but also opens new avenues for technological innovation and discovery. Our survey provides a comprehensive summary of recent NLP-based methods -- including multimodal ones -- in patent analysis. We also introduce a novel taxonomy for categorization based on tasks in the patent life cycle, as well as the specifics of the methods. This interdisciplinary survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners who work at the intersection of NLP, Multimodal AI, and patent analysis, as well as patent offices to build efficient patent systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Memory-Based Optimization for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The source code is available \footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Amber-B203/}.</description>

      <title>OpenTCM: A GraphRAG-Empowered LLM-based System for Traditional Chinese Medicine Knowledge Retrieval and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding. Last, we empower OpenTCM with GraphRAG, enabling high-fidelity ingredient knowledge retrieval and diagnostic question-answering without model fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that OpenTCM achieves mean expert scores (MES) of 4.378 in ingredient information retrieval and 4.045 in diagnostic question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in real-world TCM use cases.</description>

      <title>RAE: A Rule-Driven Approach for Attribute Embedding in Property Graph Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are crucial in modern applications to enhance the user experience and drive business conversion rates through personalization. However, insufficient utilization of attribute information within the property graph remains a significant challenge. Most existing graph convolutional network (GCN) models do not consider attribute information, and those that do often employ a simplified triple format &lt;users, items, attributes&gt;, which fails to fully exploit the rich semantic structures of property graphs necessary for effective recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Rule-Driven Approach for Attribute Embedding (RAE), a novel methodology that enhances recommendation performance by effectively mining and utilizing semantic rules from property graphs. RAE applies a rule-mining process to extract meaningful rules that guide random walks in generating enriched attribute embeddings. These enriched embeddings are subsequently integrated into GCNs, surpassing conventional triple-based embedding techniques. We evaluate RAE on real-world datasets (e.g., Blogcatalog and Flickr) and demonstrate that RAE achieves an average improvement of 10.6% in both Recall@20 and NDCG@20 compared to state-of-the-art baselines, indicating superior relevance coverage and ranking rationality in top-20 recommendations. Additionally, RAE exhibits enhanced robustness against data sparsity and the attribute missingness problem. Our novel approach underscores the significant performance gains achieved in recommendation systems by fully leveraging attribute information within property graphs, enhancing both effectiveness and reliability.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

      <title>MedRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-augmented Generation with Knowledge Graph-Elicited Reasoning for Healthcare Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.
