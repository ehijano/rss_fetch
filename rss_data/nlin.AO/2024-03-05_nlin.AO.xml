      <title>Complexified Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model and its generalizations have been broadly employed to characterize and mechanistically understand various collective dynamical phenomena, especially the emergence of synchrony among coupled oscillators. Despite almost five decades of research, many questions remain open, in particular for finite-size systems. Here, we generalize recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187201 (2023)] on the finite-size Kuramoto model with its state variables analytically continued to the complex domain and also complexify its system parameters. Intriguingly, systems of two units with purely imaginary coupling do not actively synchronize even for arbitrarily large magnitudes of the coupling strengths, $|K| \rightarrow \infty$, but exhibit conservative dynamics with asynchronous rotations or librations for all $|K|$. For generic complex coupling, both, traditional phase-locked states and asynchronous states generalize to complex locked states, fixed points off the real subspace that exist even for arbitrarily weak coupling. We analyze a new collective mode of rotations exhibiting finite, yet arbitrarily large winding numbers. Numerical simulations for large networks indicate a novel form of discontinuous phase transition. We close by pointing to a range of exciting questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Keep the bees off the trees: The particular vulnerability of species in the periphery of mutualistic networks to shock perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of multistability in mutualistic networks of plants and pollinators, where one desired state in which all species coexist competes with multiple states in which some species are gone extinct. In this setting, we examine the relation between the endangerment of pollinator species and their position within the mutualistic network. To this end, we compare endangerment rankings which are derived from the species' probabilities of going extinct due to random shock perturbations with rankings obtained from different network theoretic centrality metrics. We find that a pollinator's endangerment is strongly linked to its degree of mutualistic specialization and its position within the core-periphery structure of its mutualistic network, with the most endangered species being specialists in the outer periphery. Since particularly well established instances of such peripheral areas are tree-shaped structures which stem from links between nodes/species in the outermost shell of the network, we summarized our findings in the admittedly ambiguous slogan 'keep the bees off the trees'. Finally, we challenge the generality of our findings by testing whether the title of this work still applies when being located in the outer periphery allows pollinators to avoid competitive pressure.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Model of Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomas Schelling introduced his agent-based model of segregation in 1971 and concluded that even when there is a low amount of intolerance within society that segregation will develop if people follow their individual preferences. A large body of literature building of this framework has been built and has bolstered this claim. This paper aims to take the same framework but instead look for ways to get to an integrated state. We focus on Allport's contact hypothesis that states that if there is equal status among groups, common goals among groups, and an institutional mechanism supporting intergroup contact then intergroup contact can reduce prejudice. We incorporate the contact hypothesis by having individuals adjust their intolerance based on their current neighborhood composition and the ease of conforming to their surroundings. Furthermore, we add in positive and negative media effects, as individuals are likely to get information about an outgroup from the media (e.g., news, TV, movies, etc.) that they consume. We find that having a society composed of individuals who do not easily conform to their surroundings and displaying positive examples of both groups in media promote integration within society.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Model with Fractal Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of neuronal activity has been of great importance in neuroscience. In this field, mathematical models are useful to describe the electrophysical behaviour of neurons. One successful model used for this purpose is the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (Adex), which is composed of two ordinary differential equations. Usually, this model is considered in his standard formulation, i.e., with integer order derivatives. In this work, we propose and study the fractal extension of Adex model, which in simple terms corresponds to replacing the integer derivative by non-integer. As non-integer operators, we choose the fractal derivatives. We explore the effects of equal and different orders of fractal derivatives in the firing patterns and mean frequency of the neuron described by the Adex model. Previous results suggest that fractal derivatives can provide a more realistic representation due to the fact that the standard operators are generalized. Our findings show that the fractal order influences the inter-spike intervals and changes the mean firing frequency. In addition, the firing patterns depend not only on the neuronal parameters but also on the order of respective fractal operators. As our main conclusion, the fractal order below the unit value increases the influence of the adaptation mechanism in the spike firing patterns.</description>

      <title>Hybrid data-driven and physics-informed regularized learning of cyclic plasticity with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extendable, efficient and explainable Machine Learning approach is proposed to represent cyclic plasticity and replace conventional material models based on the Radial Return Mapping algorithm. High accuracy and stability by means of a limited amount of training data is achieved by implementing physics-informed regularizations and the back stress information. The off-loading of the Neural Network is applied to the maximal extent. The proposed model architecture is simpler and more efficient compared to existing solutions from the literature, while representing a complete three-dimensional material model. The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule. The latter, however, has a minor impact on the accuracy, which implies the generalizability of the model for a broad spectrum of evolution laws for internal variables. Numerical tests simulating several load cases are shown in detail and validated for accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Clustering of chemically propelled nanomotors in chemically active environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic nanomotors powered by chemical reactions have been designed to act as vehicles for active cargo transport, drug delivery as well as a variety of other uses. Collections of such motors, acting in consort, can self-assemble to form swarms or clusters, providing opportunities for applications on various length scales. While such collective behavior has been studied when the motors move in a chemically inactive fluid environment, when the medium in which they move is a chemical network that supports complex spatial and temporal patterns, through simulation and theoretical analysis we show that collective behavior changes. Spatial patterns in the environment can guide and control motor collective states, and interactions of the motors with their environment can give rise to distinctive spatiotemporal motor patterns. The results are illustrated by studies of the motor dynamics in systems that support Turing patterns and spiral waves. This work is relevant for potential applications that involve many active nanomotors moving in complex chemical or biological environments.</description>
