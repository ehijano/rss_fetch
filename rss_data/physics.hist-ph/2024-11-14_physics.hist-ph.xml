      <title>The Grass of the Universe: Rethinking Technosphere, Planetary History, and Sustainability with Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SETI is not a usual point of departure for environmental humanities. However, this paper argues that theories originating in this field have direct implications for how we think about viable inhabitation of the Earth. To demonstrate SETI's impact on environmental humanities, this paper introduces Fermi paradox as a speculative tool to probe possible trajectories of planetary history, and especially the "Sustainability Solution" proposed by Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum. This solution suggests that sustainable coupling between extraterrestrial intelligences and their planetary environments is the major factor in the possibility of their successful detection by remote observation. By positing that exponential growth is not a sustainable development pattern, this solution rules out space-faring civilizations colonizing solar systems or galaxies. This paper elaborates on Haqq-Misra's and Baum's arguments, and discusses speculative implications of the Sustainability Solution, thus rethinking three concepts in environmental humanities: technosphere, planetary history, and sustainability. The paper advocates that (1) technosphere is a transitory layer that shall fold back into biosphere; (2) planetary history must be understood in a generic perspective that abstracts from terrestrial particularities; and (3) sustainability is not sufficient vector of viable human inhabitation of the Earth, suggesting instead habitability and genesity as better candidates.</description>

      <title>Timekeeping at Akhet Khufu, as shown by the Diary of Merer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the Diary of Merer (papyri Wadi al-Jarf) allows us to see the Egyptian calendar applied in a logbook. The diary is dated to the 26th year of reign of Khufu and describes Merer and his crew transporting the limestone blocks from the Tura quarries to Akhet Khufu, that is, the pyramid of Khufu (Old Kingdom). We find a calendar with 30-day months, 10-day weeks, five epagomenal days and Merer's job adapted to the seasons of the year. Seasons and epagomenal days have names according to inscriptions on the east wall of the Tehne tomb of Nj-k'-'nh, early Fifth Dynasty. The Diary gives us an overall impression of extreme modernity in the logistics of ancient Egypt. And Merer looks like a person with a reputation for good timekeeping at Akhet Khufu.</description>
