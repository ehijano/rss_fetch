      <title>An Analysis of the Preferences of Distribution Indicators in Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of objective vectors in a Pareto Front Approximation (PFA) is crucial for representing the associated manifold accurately. Distribution Indicators (DIs) assess the distribution of a PFA numerically, utilizing concepts like distance calculation, Biodiversity, Entropy, Potential Energy, or Clustering. Despite the diversity of DIs, their strengths and weaknesses across assessment scenarios are not well-understood. This paper introduces a taxonomy for classifying DIs, followed by a preference analysis of nine DIs, each representing a category in the taxonomy. Experimental results, considering various PFAs under controlled scenarios (loss of coverage, loss of uniformity, pathological distributions), reveal that some DIs can be misleading and need cautious use. Additionally, DIs based on Biodiversity and Potential Energy show promise for PFA evaluation and comparison of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of photodetectors design: comparison between Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithm optimisations applied to the design of photodetectors based on a transimpedance amplifier and a photodiode. The circuit performance is evaluated with a merit function and the systematic search method is used as a reference. The design parameters are the feedback network components and the photodiode bias voltage. To evaluate the optimisations, we define the relative difference between its merit and the optimum merit obtained by the systematic search. In both algorithms, the relative difference decreases with the number of evaluations, following a power law. The power-law exponent for the Genetic Algorithm is larger than that of Montecarlo (0.74 vs. 0.50). We conclude that both algorithms are advantageous compared to the systematic search method, and that the Genetic Algorithm shows a better performance than Montecarlo.</description>

      <title>Magic for the Age of Quantized DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the number of parameters in DNNs has explosively increased, as exemplified by LLMs (Large Language Models), making inference on small-scale computers more difficult. Model compression technology is, therefore, essential for integration into products. In this paper, we propose a method of quantization-aware training. We introduce a novel normalization (Layer-Batch Normalization) that is independent of the mini-batch size and does not require any additional computation cost during inference. Then, we quantize the weights by the scaled round-clip function with the weight standardization. We also quantize activation functions using the same function and apply surrogate gradients to train the model with both quantized weights and the quantized activation functions. We call this method Magic for the age of Quantised DNNs (MaQD). Experimental results show that our quantization method can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation.</description>

      <title>Spiking Wavelet Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by mimicking the event-driven processing of the brain. Incorporating the Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy, yet it is incompetent to capture high-frequency patterns like moving edge and pixel-level brightness changes due to their reliance on global self-attention operations. Porting frequency representations in SNN is challenging yet crucial for event-driven vision. To address this issue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free architecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features in a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The critical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2) convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation. We also adopt negative spike dynamics to strengthen the frequency representation further. This enables the SWformer to outperform vanilla Spiking Transformers in capturing high-frequency visual components, as evidenced by our empirical results. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate SWformer's effectiveness in capturing spatial-frequency patterns in a multiplication-free, event-driven fashion, outperforming state-of-the-art SNNs. SWformer achieves an over 50% reduction in energy consumption, a 21.1% reduction in parameter count, and a 2.40% performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers.</description>

      <title>Model Uncertainty in Evolutionary Optimization and Bayesian Optimization: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box optimization problems, which are common in many real-world applications, require optimization through input-output interactions without access to internal workings. This often leads to significant computational resources being consumed for simulations. Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (SAEA) are two widely used gradient-free optimization techniques employed to address such challenges. Both approaches follow a similar iterative procedure that relies on surrogate models to guide the search process. This paper aims to elucidate the similarities and differences in the utilization of model uncertainty between these two methods, as well as the impact of model inaccuracies on algorithmic performance. A novel model-assisted strategy is introduced, which utilizes unevaluated solutions to generate offspring, leveraging the population-based search capabilities of evolutionary algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of model-assisted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms mainstream Bayesian optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Training Fully Connected Neural Networks is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding weights and biases for a two-layer fully connected neural network to fit a given set of data points as well as possible, also known as EmpiricalRiskMinimization. Our main result is that the associated decision problem is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, that is, polynomial-time equivalent to determining whether a multivariate polynomial with integer coefficients has any real roots. Furthermore, we prove that algebraic numbers of arbitrarily large degree are required as weights to be able to train some instances to optimality, even if all data points are rational. Our result already applies to fully connected instances with two inputs, two outputs, and one hidden layer of ReLU neurons. Thereby, we strengthen a result by Abrahamsen, Kleist and Miltzow [NeurIPS 2021]. A consequence of this is that a combinatorial search algorithm like the one by Arora, Basu, Mianjy and Mukherjee [ICLR 2018] is impossible for networks with more than one output dimension, unless $\mathsf{NP}=\exists\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>From Complexity to Clarity: Analytical Expressions of Deep Neural Network Weights via Clifford's Geometric Algebra and Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel analysis of neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebra and convex optimization. We show that optimal weights of deep ReLU neural networks are given by the wedge product of training samples when trained with standard regularized loss. Furthermore, the training problem reduces to convex optimization over wedge product features, which encode the geometric structure of the training dataset. This structure is given in terms of signed volumes of triangles and parallelotopes generated by data vectors. The convex problem finds a small subset of samples via $\ell_1$ regularization to discover only relevant wedge product features. Our analysis provides a novel perspective on the inner workings of deep neural networks and sheds light on the role of the hidden layers.</description>

      <title>RFI Detection with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and mitigating Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is critical for enabling and maximising the scientific output of radio telescopes. The emergence of machine learning methods has led to their application in radio astronomy, and in RFI detection. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological systems, are well-suited for processing spatio-temporal data. This study introduces the first exploratory application of SNNs to an astronomical data-processing task, specifically RFI detection. We adapt the nearest-latent-neighbours (NLN) algorithm and auto-encoder architecture proposed by previous authors to SNN execution by direct ANN2SNN conversion, enabling simplified downstream RFI detection by sampling the naturally varying latent space from the internal spiking neurons. Our subsequent evaluation aims to determine whether SNNs are viable for future RFI detection schemes. We evaluate detection performance with the simulated HERA telescope and hand-labelled LOFAR observation dataset the original authors provided. We additionally evaluate detection performance with a new MeerKAT-inspired simulation dataset that provides a technical challenge for machine-learnt RFI detection methods. This dataset focuses on satellite-based RFI, an increasingly important class of RFI and is an additional contribution. Our approach remains competitive with existing methods in AUROC, AUPRC and F1 scores for the HERA dataset but exhibits difficulty in the LOFAR and Tabascal datasets. Our method maintains this accuracy while completely removing the compute and memory-intense latent sampling step found in NLN. This work demonstrates the viability of SNNs as a promising avenue for machine-learning-based RFI detection in radio telescopes by establishing a minimal performance baseline on traditional and nascent satellite-based RFI sources and is the first work to our knowledge to apply SNNs in astronomy.</description>
