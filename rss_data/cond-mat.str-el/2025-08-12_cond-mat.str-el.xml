      <title>Defect Networks for Topological Phases Protected By Modulated Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Gapless fracton quantum spin liquid and emergent photons in a 2D spin-1 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Classical fracton spin liquid and Hilbert space fragmentation in a 2D spin-$1/2$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical U(1) fracton spin liquids feature an extensive ground state degeneracy and follow an effective description in terms of a tensor Gauss' law where charges, so-called fractons, have restricted mobility. Here we introduce a simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward discretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The simplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's fundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations, height-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as properties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free subspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state manifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when explicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the existence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid. However, we observe that perturbative quantum effects are insufficient to efficiently tunnel between classical ground states, leading to severe Hilbert space fragmentation which obscures fractonic quantum behavior. Specifically, by simulating the spin-1/2 quantum model with Green function Monte Carlo as a function of the Rokhsar-Kivelson potential, we find that the system supports either magnetic long-range order or a classical spin liquid. Our findings highlight the crucial role of Hilbert-space fragmentation in fractonic spin systems but also indicate ways to mitigate such effects via increasing the spin magnitude to $S=1$, investigated in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Mediated Cross-Layer Pairing in Pressurized Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Strange-like Metallicity in a Toy Model with Selective-Mottness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between band and atomic aspects in materials with co-existing wide-band and flat-band states, or wide-band and effectively dispersionless electronic states is increasingly expected to lead to novel behavior. Using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), we investigate strange-metal-like behavior and emergence of unconventional superconductivity in a toy model that captures this interplay. Surprisingly, we find good accord with transport features seen in underdoped cuprates and ladder Fe-arsenides. We connect our findings to proposals of FL$^{*}$ and orthogonal Fermi liquids, and present a route to it's direct instability to novel, competing orders.</description>

      <title>Optically Tunable Spin Transport in Bilayer Altermagnetic Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in the Two-Dimensional ferromagnetic metal FePd2Te2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric effect enables simpler, more flexible thermoelectric devices by generating electricity perpendicular to heat flow, offering promising solutions for waste heat recovery and solid-state cooling applications. Here, we report a striking observation of zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) below TC in the two-dimensional metallic magnet FePd2Te2. The anomalous Nernst signal Syx^A peaks a maximum value of 0.15 {\mu}V/K at 100 K, much larger than that of conventional FM materials. Remarkably, the derived ratio alpha_ij/sigma_ij in FePd2Te2 approaches the fundamental limit of 86 {\mu}V/K. Our findings suggest a dominant Berry curvature contribution to the ANE. The observed giant zero-field anomalous Nernst response in 2D FePd2Te2 not only advances fundamental understanding of transverse thermoelectricity in layered magnets, but also provides this material as a promising candidate for practical thermoelectric spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of gapless collective charge fluctuations in an Anderson insulating state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T&gt;150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T&lt;50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement and surface criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out what kind of bipartition truly reflects the criticality of the bulk. We have found that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still persists even at a bulk-gapless point (e.g. critical point), thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Insulator-bad metal transition in RNiO$_3$ nickelates beyond Hubbard model and density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory. However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Field-Tailoring Quantum Materials: Magneto-Synthesis of Metastable Metallic States in a Spin-Orbit-Coupled Trimer Iridate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Condensed Spin Excitation of Quantized Dirac Fermions in the Quasi-Two-Dimensional semimetal BaMnBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears, and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field. The result demonstrates a condensation of quantized Dirac fermions in the quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cutler-Mott relation in a two-site charge Kondo simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of the Cutler-Mott relations outside the Landau Fermi-liquid concept. We consider a two-site charge Kondo circuit as a paradigmatic example of a system possessing both Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid properties. It is shown that the generalized Cutler-Mott-like relations derived in the paper hold in both operating regimes of the charge Kondo quantum circuit describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Straintronics across Lieb-Kagome interconversion and variable transport scaling exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion. Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid and glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Wannier Center Analysis on Possible Three-Dimensional Topological Phases in \alpha-Type Layered Organic Conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>On the N\'eel Vector Dependence of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependence of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism on the experimental geometry is described by a frequency-dependent Hall vector. Using group theory, we derive a general relationship between the Hall vector and the orientation of the N\'eel vector $\bL$ in altermagnets within the free valence spin (FVS) approximation, where the spin-orbit coupling of the valence electrons and their exchange interaction with the core electrons are neglected. For a given spin point group, the full $\bL$-dependence of the Hall vector can be expressed in terms of several irreducible spectral functions. This derivation generalizes earlier results for the special cases of MnTe and MnF$_2$. Depending on the system symmetry, XMCD in the FVS approximation may be present, emerge only when the neglected terms are included, or be completely forbidden.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Chern band in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindblad dynamics of quantum spin systems on infinite lattices and define a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) and a time-averaged nonequilibrium steady state (TANESS) on the basis of $C^*$-algebraic formalism. Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.</description>

      <title>Time Ordering Effects and Destruction of Quasiparticles in Two-dimensional Holographic CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics induced by a composite operator, defined as the local operator evolved with the time evolution operator constructed of the Euclidean and Lorentzian ones. The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.</description>

      <title>Cu2OSeO3 Turns Trigonal with Structural Transformation and Implications for Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and characteristics of magnetic skyrmions are strongly governed by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure. In this study, we report the discovery of a new trigonal polymorph of Cu2OSeO3, observed exclusively in nanoparticles. Electron diffraction and density functional theory calculations confirm its R3m space group, sharing C3v symmetry with N\'eel-type skyrmion hosts. This polymorph is likely stabilized by surface effects, suggesting that size-induced structural changes may drive a transformation from Bloch-type to Neel-type skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3. This hypothesis is consistent with prior unexplained observations of Neel-type skyrmions at the surfaces of bulk crystals, which may result from surface-specific structural distortions. Overall, these findings provide insights into the interplay between size, structure, and magnetism, opening pathways for controlling skyrmionic properties in nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz range polarization rotation in the candidate time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor BiNi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.</description>

Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</description>

Abstract: Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of Fredenhagen-Marcu string order parameters at topological phase transitions with emergent higher-form symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Non-Fermi Liquid and Dynamical Planckian Scaling of a Quasi-Kagome Kondo Lattice System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the quantum critical point of correlated materials, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The relaxation time of the interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, is scaled with the Planckian time, $\hbar/k_{\rm B}T$. However, there is a debate over whether heavy-fermion systems can obey the Planckian time. In the optical conductivity spectra, the Drude response will appear as the scaling of $\hbar\omega/k_{\rm B}T$ as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we report the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$. The heavy carriers' Drude response only for the Ce quasi-kagome plane obeyed DPS below 80 K, suggesting the anisotropic quantum criticality with the strong $c \textrm{-} f$ hybridization.</description>

Abstract: Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled to their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We show that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect. We further demonstrate the emergence of the finite thermal Hall conductivity in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals by the linear spin-wave theory. The possible impact of different gauge structures on a thermal Hall conductivity is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <title>Low-energy optical absorption in correlated insulators: Projected sum rules and the role of quantum geometry</title>

Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of a variety of correlated insulators in the moir\'e universe, controlled by interactions projected to a set of isolated bands with a narrow bandwidth, we examine here a partial sum-rule associated with the inverse frequency-weighted optical conductivity restricted to low-energies. Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</description>

Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed.

Abstract: Motivated by the magnetism of pyrochlore oxides, we consider the effect of quantum fluctuations in the most general symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor Kramers exchange Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. At the classical level, this Hamiltonian exhibits a rich landscape of classical spin liquids and a variety of nonconventional magnetic phases. In contrast, much remains unclear for the quantum model, where quantum fluctuations have the potential to alter the classical landscape and stabilize novel magnetic phases. Employing state-of-the-art pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, we determine the quantum phase diagram at relevant cross-sections, where the classical model hosts an algebraic nodal rank-2 spin liquid and a spin nematic order. We find large regions in parameter space on which dipolar magnetic order is absent and, based on known fingerprints in the correlation functions, we suggest that this nonconventional region is composed of an ensemble of distinct phases stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Our results hint at the existence of a spin nematic phase, and we identify the quantum analog of the classical rank-2 spin liquid. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of assessing the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in reconciling the experimental findings on the nature of magnetic order in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Atomic Altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N\'eel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N\'eel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42{\deg} and 26{\deg} respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N\'eel order of local dipole moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation is be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</description>

Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster-than-linear growth with the descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$, displaying maximal violation.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation
  eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value.
  This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>
