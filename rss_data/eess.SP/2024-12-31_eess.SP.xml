      <title>Universal MIMO Jammer Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-antenna processing enables jammer mitigation through spatial filtering, provided that the receiver knows the spatial signature of the jammer interference. Estimating this signature is easy for barrage jammers that transmit continuously and with static signature, but difficult for more sophisticated jammers. Smart jammers may deliberately suspend transmission when the receiver tries to estimate their spatial signature, or they may use time-varying beamforming to continuously change their spatial signature. To deal with such smart jammers, we propose MASH, the first method that indiscriminately mitigates all types of jammers. Assume that the transmitter and receiver share a common secret. Based on this secret, the transmitter embeds (with a time-domain transform) its signal in a secret subspace of a higher-dimensional space. The receiver applies a reciprocal transform to the receive signal, which (i) raises the legitimate transmit signal from its secret subspace and (ii) provably transforms any jammer into a barrage jammer, making estimation and mitigation via multi-antenna processing straightforward. Focusing on the massive multi-user MIMO uplink, we present three MASH-based data detectors and show their jammer-resilience via extensive simulations. We also introduce strategies for multi-user communication without a global secret as well as methods that use computationally efficient embedding and raising transforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable-Element STARS for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel movable-element enabled simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (ME-STARS) communication system is proposed, where ME-STARS elements positions can be adjusted to enhance the degress-of-freedom for transmission and reflection. For each ME-STARS operating protocols, namely energy-splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS), a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the active beamforming at the base station (BS) as well as the elements positions and passive beamforming at the ME-STARS. An alternative optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is developed to decompose the original non-convex problem into three subproblems. Specifically, the gradient descent algorithm is employed for solving the ME-STARS element position optimization subproblem, and the weighted minimum mean square error and the successive convex approximation methods are invoked for solving the active and passive beamforming subproblems, respectively. It is further demonstrated that the proposed AO algorithm for ES can be extended to solve the problems for MS and TS. Numerical results unveil that: 1) the ME-STARS can significantly improve the WSR compared to the STARS with fixed position elements and the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface with movable elements, thanks to the extra spatial-domain diversity and the higher flexibility in beamforming; and 2) the performance gain of ME-STARS is significant in the scenarios with larger number of users or more scatterers.</description>

      <title>On Random Sampling of Diffused Graph Signals with Sparse Inputs on Vertex Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sampling of graph signals has recently drawn much attention due to the wide applications of graph signal processing. While a lot of efficient methods and interesting results have been reported to the sampling of band-limited or smooth graph signals, few research has been devoted to non-smooth graph signals, especially to sparse graph signals, which are also of importance in many practical applications. This paper addresses the random sampling of non-smooth graph signals generated by diffusion of sparse inputs. We aim to present a solid theoretical analysis on the random sampling of diffused sparse graph signals, which can be parallel to that of band-limited graph signals, and thus present a sufficient condition to the number of samples ensuring the unique recovery for uniform random sampling. Then, we focus on two classes of widely used binary graph models, and give explicit and tighter estimations on the sampling numbers ensuring unique recovery. We also propose an adaptive variable-density sampling strategy to provide a better performance than uniform random sampling. Finally, simulation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting for Annotation-Efficient Bacteria Raman Spectroscopy Clustering and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman scattering is based on molecular vibration spectroscopy and provides a powerful technology for pathogenic bacteria diagnosis using the unique molecular fingerprint information of a substance. The integration of deep learning technology has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of intelligent Raman spectroscopy (RS) recognition. However, the current RS recognition methods based on deep neural networks still require the annotation of a large amount of spectral data, which is labor-intensive. This paper presents a novel annotation-efficient Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting (SCDC) method for RS recognition that operates effectively with few or no annotation. Our core motivation is to represent the spectrum from two different perspectives in two distinct subspaces: embedding and category. The embedding perspective captures instance-level information, while the category perspective reflects category-level information. Accordingly, we have implemented a dual contrastive learning approach from two perspectives to obtain discriminative representations, which are applicable for Raman spectroscopy recognition under both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning conditions. Furthermore, a self-calibration mechanism is proposed to enhance robustness. Validation of the identification task on three large-scale bacterial Raman spectroscopy datasets demonstrates that our SCDC method achieves robust recognition performance with very few (5$\%$ or 10$\%$) or no annotations, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for biospectral identification in annotation-efficient clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-to-Phase Conversion in Injection-Locked CMOS Ring Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injection-locked ring oscillators (ILROs) are extensively employed for multi-phase clock generation in wireline and optical links. However, existing injection-locking theorems primarily rely on linearized phase-domain or nonlinear time-domain models, which fail to account for amplitude-to-phase conversion effects inherent in ILROs. This paper introduces an enhanced analytical model based on an extension of Adler's equation, explicitly incorporating amplitude-to-phase conversion. Simulation results demonstrate strong alignment with the proposed analytical predictions, validating the model's accuracy in capturing the locking range and phasor relationships.</description>

      <title>Frames and vertex-frequency representations in graph fractional Fourier domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex-frequency analysis, particularly the windowed graph Fourier transform (WGFT), is a significant challenge in graph signal processing. Tight frame theories is known for its low computational complexity in signal reconstruction, while fractional order methods shine at unveil more detailed structural characteristics of graph signals. In the graph fractional Fourier domain, we introduce multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (MWGFRFF) to facilitate the construction of tight frames. This leads to developing the multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier transform (MWGFRFT), enabling novel vertex-frequency analysis methods. A reconstruction formula is derived, along with results concerning dual and tight frames. To enhance computational efficiency, a fast MWGFRFT (FMWGFRFT) algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, we define shift multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (SMWGFRFF) and their associated transform (SMWGFRFT), exploring their dual and tight frames. Experimental results indicate that FMWGFRFT and SMWGFRFT excel in extracting vertex-frequency features in the graph fractional Fourier domain, with their combined use optimizing analytical performance. Applications in signal anomaly detection demonstrate the advantages of FMWGFRFT.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Design for AP Mode Selection of Cooperative ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging technology, cooperative bi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is promising to achieve high-precision sensing, high-rate communication as well as self-interference (SI) avoidance. This paper investigates the two-timescale design for access point (AP) mode selection to realize the full potential of the cooperative bi-static ISAC network with low system overhead, where the beamforming at the APs is adapted to the rapidly-changing instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the AP mode is adapted to the slowly-changing statistical CSI. We first apply the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator to estimate the channel between the APs and the channels from the APs to the user equipments (UEs). Then we adopt the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming and the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector, and derive the closed-form expressions of the communication rate and the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). We formulate a non-convex integer optimization problem to maximize the minimum sensing SINR under the communication quality of service (QoS) constraints. McCormick envelope relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are applied to solve the challenging non-convex integer optimization problem. Simulation results validate the closed-form expressions and prove the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed AP mode selection scheme.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC-empowered Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</description>

Abstract: A novel frequency diverse array (FDA)-assisted secure transmission framework is proposed, which leverages additional frequency offsets to enhance physical layer security. Specifically, an FDA-assisted wiretap channel is considered, where the transmit beamforming and frequency offsets at each antenna are jointly optimized. A novel alternating optimization-based method is introduced to address the non-convex problem of secure transmission, focusing on minimizing transmit power and maximizing the secrecy rate. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the FDA-based framework compared to systems employing traditional phased array antennas in secure transmission.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the prospects of the low-altitude economy (LAE) and the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are increasing demands on monitoring flying objects at low altitude in wide urban areas. In this work, the widely deployed long-term evolution (LTE) base station (BS) is exploited to illuminate UAVs in bistatic trajectory tracking. Specifically, a passive sensing receiver with two digital antenna arrays is proposed and developed to capture both the line-of-sight (LoS) signal and the scattered signal off a target UAV. From their cross ambiguity function, the bistatic range, Doppler shift and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the target UAV can be detected in a sequence of time slots. In order to address missed detections and false alarms of passive sensing, a multi-target tracking framework is adopted to track the trajectory of the target UAV. It is demonstrated by experiments that the proposed UAV tracking system can achieve a meter-level accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generative deep learning model for the synthesis of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) active sensing waveforms with desired properties, including constant modulus and a user-defined beampattern. The proposed approach is capable synthesizing unique phase codes of on-the-fly, which has the potential to reduce interference between co-existing active sensing systems and facilitate Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) radar operation. The paper extends our earlier work on synthesis of approximately orthogonal MIMO phase codes by introducing flexible control over the transmit beampatterns. The developed machine learning method employs a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structure. The main benefits of the method are its ability to discover new waveforms on-demand (post training) and generate demanding beampatterns at lower computational complexity compared to structured optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Empowered Semantic Feature Multiple Access (SFMA) Over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI) empowered multi-user semantic communication system called semantic feature multiple access (SFMA) for video transmission, which comprises a base station (BS) and paired users. The BS generates and combines semantic information of several frames simultaneously requested by paired users into a single signal. Users recover their frames from this combined signal and input the recovered frames into a GAI-based video frame interpolation model to generate the intermediate frame. To optimize transmission rates and temporal gaps between simultaneously transmitted frames, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate while minimizing temporal gaps. Since the standard signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equation does not accurately capture the performance of our semantic communication system, we introduce a weight parameter into the SINR equation to better represent the system's performance. Due to its dependence on transmit power, we propose a three-step solution. First, we develop a user pairing algorithm that pairs two users with the highest preference value, a weighted combination of semantic transmission rate and temporal gap. Second, we optimize inter-group power allocation by formulating an optimization problem that allocates proper transmit power across all user groups to maximize system sum rates while satisfying each user's minimum rate requirement. Third, we address intra-group power allocation to enhance each user's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our method improves transmission rates by up to 24.8%, 45.8%, and 66.1% compared to fixed-power non-orthogonal multiple access (F-NOMA), orthogonal joint source-channel coding (O-JSCC), and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), respectively.</description>

      <title>Sequential Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of Wideband Polynomial-Phase Signals on Sensor Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequential estimator for the direction-of-arrival and polynomial coefficients of wideband polynomial-phase signals impinging on a sensor array. Addressing the computational challenges of Maximum-likelihood estimation for this problem, we propose a method leveraging random sampling consensus (RANSAC) applied to the time-frequency spatial signatures of sources. Our approach supports multiple sources and higher-order polynomials by employing coherent array processing and sequential approximations of the Maximum-likelihood cost function. We also propose a low-complexity variant that estimates source directions via angular domain random sampling. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve Cram\'er-Rao bounds in challenging multi-source scenarios, including closely spaced time-frequency spatial signatures, highlighting their suitability for advanced radar signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Deep Learning and GIS for Advanced Remote Sensing Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework for remote sensing image analysis by fusing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of spatial data analysis by overcoming challenges associated with high dimensionality, complex patterns, and temporal data processing. We implemented optimization algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), to fine-tune model parameters, resulting in improved performance metrics. Our findings reveal a significant increase in classification accuracy from 78% to 92% and a reduction in prediction error from 12% to 6% after optimization. Additionally, the temporal accuracy of the models improved from 75% to 88%, showcasing the frameworks capability to monitor dynamic changes effectively. The integration of GIS not only enriched the spatial analysis but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the relationships between geographical features. This research demonstrates that combining advanced deep learning methods with GIS and optimization strategies can significantly advance remote sensing applications, paving the way for future developments in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and resource management.</description>

      <title>MobileNetV2: A lightweight classification model for home-based sleep apnea screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel lightweight neural network model leveraging features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals for early OSA screening. ECG signals are used to generate feature spectrograms to predict sleep stages, while respiratory signals are employed to detect sleep-related breathing abnormalities. By integrating these predictions, the method calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with enhanced accuracy, facilitating precise OSA diagnosis.
  The method was validated on three publicly available sleep apnea databases: the Apnea-ECG database, the UCDDB dataset, and the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database. Results showed an overall OSA detection accuracy of 0.978, highlighting the model's robustness. Respiratory event classification achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. For sleep stage classification, in UCDDB dataset, the ROC-AUC exceeded 0.85 across all stages, with recall for Sleep reaching 0.906 and specificity for REM and Wake states at 0.956 and 0.937, respectively.
  This study underscores the potential of integrating lightweight neural networks with multi-signal analysis for accurate, portable, and cost-effective OSA screening, paving the way for broader adoption in home-based and wearable health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI-empowered Low Altitude Economy: Integrated Sensing, Communications, Computation, and Control (ISC3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low altitude economy (LAE) holds immense potential to drive urban development across various sectors. However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</description>

      <title>CrossSpeech++: Cross-lingual Speech Synthesis with Decoupled Language and Speaker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to generate natural speech in multiple languages while maintaining the same speaker identity, a task known as cross-lingual speech synthesis. A key challenge of cross-lingual speech synthesis is the language-speaker entanglement problem, which causes the quality of cross-lingual systems to lag behind that of intra-lingual systems. In this paper, we propose CrossSpeech++, which effectively disentangles language and speaker information and significantly improves the quality of cross-lingual speech synthesis. To this end, we break the complex speech generation pipeline into two simple components: language-dependent and speaker-dependent generators. The language-dependent generator produces linguistic variations that are not biased by specific speaker attributes. The speaker-dependent generator models acoustic variations that characterize speaker identity. By handling each type of information in separate modules, our method can effectively disentangle language and speaker representation. We conduct extensive experiments using various metrics, and demonstrate that CrossSpeech++ achieves significant improvements in cross-lingual speech synthesis, outperforming existing methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</description>

      <title>ASE: Practical Acoustic Speed Estimation Beyond Doppler via Sound Diffusion Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive human speed estimation plays a critical role in acoustic sensing. Despite extensive study, existing systems, however, suffer from various limitations: First, previous acoustic speed estimation exploits Doppler Frequency Shifts (DFS) created by moving targets and relies on microphone arrays, making them only capable of sensing the radial speed within a constrained distance. Second, the channel measurement rate proves inadequate to estimate high moving speeds. To overcome these issues, we present ASE, an accurate and robust Acoustic Speed Estimation system on a single commodity microphone. We model the sound propagation from a unique perspective of the acoustic diffusion field, and infer the speed from the acoustic spatial distribution, a completely different way of thinking about speed estimation beyond prior DFS-based approaches. We then propose a novel Orthogonal Time-Delayed Multiplexing (OTDM) scheme for acoustic channel estimation at a high rate that was previously infeasible, making it possible to estimate high speeds. We further develop novel techniques for motion detection and signal enhancement to deliver a robust and practical system. We implement and evaluate ASE through extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that ASE reliably tracks walking speed, independently of target location and direction, with a mean error of 0.13 m/s, a reduction of 2.5x from DFS, and a detection rate of 97.4% for large coverage, e.g., free walking in a 4m $\times$ 4m room. We believe ASE pushes acoustic speed estimation beyond the conventional DFS-based paradigm and will inspire exciting research in acoustic sensing.</description>

      <title>Bird Vocalization Embedding Extraction Using Self-Supervised Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the extraction of the bird vocalization embedding from the whole song level using disentangled representation learning (DRL). Bird vocalization embeddings are necessary for large-scale bioacoustic tasks, and self-supervised methods such as Variational Autoencoder (VAE) have shown their performance in extracting such low-dimensional embeddings from vocalization segments on the note or syllable level. To extend the processing level to the entire song instead of cutting into segments, this paper regards each vocalization as the generalized and discriminative part and uses two encoders to learn these two parts. The proposed method is evaluated on the Great Tits dataset according to the clustering performance, and the results outperform the compared pre-trained models and vanilla VAE. Finally, this paper analyzes the informative part of the embedding, further compresses its dimension, and explains the disentangled performance of bird vocalizations.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of quantum machine learning to End-to-End (E2E) communication systems in wireless fading scenarios. We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that combines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE) framework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work that can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical DNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits steady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Driven Link SINR Assurance in RIS-assisted Indoor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future smart factories are expected to deploy applications over high-performance indoor wireless channels in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, which on the other hand are susceptible to high path losses and Line-of Sight (LoS) blockages. Low-cost Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can provide great opportunities in such scenarios, due to its ability to alleviate LoS link blockages. In this paper, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, solved with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to optimally maintain connectivity by solving the problem of allocating RIS to robots in a wireless indoor network. Our model exploits the characteristic of nulling interference from RISs by tuning RIS reflection coefficients. We further consider Quality-of-Service (QoS) at receivers in terms of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and connection outages due to insufficient transmission quality service. Numerical results for optimal solutions and heuristics show the benefits of optimally deploying RISs by providing continuous connectivity through SINR, which significantly reduces outages due to link quality.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Array Aided Ultra Reliable Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</description>

      <title>Exploiting NOMA Transmissions in Multi-UAV-assisted Wireless Networks: From Aerial-RIS to Mode-switching UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted wireless network, where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) collect data from ground users (GUs) by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) method. The ARIS provides enhanced channel controllability to improve the NOMA transmissions and reduce the co-channel interference among UAVs. We also propose a novel dual-mode switching scheme, where each UAV equipped with both an ARIS and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver can adaptively perform passive reflection or active transmission. We aim to maximize the overall network throughput by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectory planning and operating modes, the ARIS's passive beamforming, and the GUs' transmission control strategies. We propose an optimization-driven hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (O-HDRL) method to decompose it into a series of subproblems. Specifically, the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) adjusts the UAVs' trajectory planning and mode switching strategies, while the passive beamforming and transmission control strategies are tackled by the optimization methods. Numerical results reveal that the O-HDRL efficiently improves the learning stability and reward performance compared to the benchmark methods. Meanwhile, the dual-mode switching scheme is verified to achieve a higher throughput performance compared to the fixed ARIS scheme.</description>

Abstract: LPWAN service's inexpensive cost and long range capabilities make it a promising addition and countless satellite companies have started taking advantage of this technology to connect IoT users across the globe. However, LEO satellites have the unique challenge of using rechargeable batteries and green solar energy to power their components. LPWAN technology is not optimized to maximize battery lifespan of network nodes. By incorporating a MAC protocol that maximizes node the battery lifespan across the network, we can reduce battery waste and usage of scarce Earth resources to develop satellite batteries.</description>

      <title>Improved ICNN-LSTM Model Classification Based on Attitude Sensor Data for Hazardous State Assessment of Magnetic Adhesion Climbing Wall Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots are widely utilized in high-altitude inspection, welding, and cleaning tasks due to their ability to perform various operations against gravity on vertical or inclined walls. However, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused by its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates and subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM network classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) attitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous states in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data acquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute vibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model combining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves significant results, and the proposed classification model consistently exhibits high accuracy compared to other models. The research findings provide effective technical support for the safe operation of climbing robots</description>

      <title>Beam Codebook Refinement for mmWave Devices with Random Orientations: Concept and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in codebook-based beam-steering for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems due to its potential for low complexity and rapid beam search. A key focus of recent research has been the design of codebooks that strike a trade-off between achievable gain and codebook size, which directly impacts beam search time. Statistical approaches have shown promise by leveraging the likelihood that certain beam directions (equivalently, sets of phase-shifter configurations) are more probable than others. Such approaches are shown to be valid for static, non-rotating transmission stations such as base stations. However, for the case of user terminals that are constantly changing orientation, the possible phase-shifter configurations become equally probable, rendering statistical methods less relevant. On the other hand, user terminals come with a large number of possible steering vector configurations, which can span up to six orders of magnitude. Therefore, efficient solutions to reduce the codebook size (set of possible steering vectors) without compromising array gain are needed. We address this challenge by proposing a novel and practical codebook refinement technique, aiming to reduce the codebook size while maintaining array gain within $\gamma$ dB of the maximum achievable gain at any random orientation of the user terminal. We project that a steering vector at a given angle could effectively cover adjacent angles with a small gain loss compared to the maximum achievable gain. We demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to reduce the codebook size from $1024^{16}$ to just a few configurations (e.g., less than ten), covering all angles while maintaining the gain within $\gamma=3$ dB of the maximum achievable gain.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization for different physical layer tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse physical layer tasks introduces extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task physical layer network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish multiple tasks and adapted the features of different formats of wireless data for the features of LLM. Numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>LEO Satellite-Enabled Random Access with Large Differential Delay and Doppler Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection for LEO satellite-enabled grant-free random access systems, specifically targeting scenarios where remote Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices operate without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) assistance. Considering the constrained power consumption of these devices, the large differential delay and Doppler shift are handled at the satellite receiver. We firstly propose a spreading-based multi-frame transmission scheme with orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation to mitigate the doubly dispersive effect in time and frequency, and then analyze the input-output relationship of the system. Next, we propose a receiver structure based on three modules: a linear module for identifying active devices that leverages the generalized approximate message passing algorithm to eliminate inter-user and inter-carrier interference; a non-linear module that employs the message passing algorithm to jointly estimate the channel and detect the transmitted symbols; and a third module that aims to exploit the three dimensional block channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler-angle domain. Soft information is exchanged among the three modules by careful message scheduling. Furthermore, the expectation-maximization algorithm is integrated to adjust phase rotation caused by the fractional Doppler and to learn the hyperparameters in the priors. Finally, the convolutional neural network is incorporated to enhance the symbol detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission scheme boosts the system performance, and the designed algorithms outperform the conventional methods significantly in terms of the device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection.</description>

      <title>CF-CGN: Channel Fingerprints Extrapolation for Multi-band Massive MIMO Transmission based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-band massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication can promote the cooperation of licensed and unlicensed spectra, effectively enhancing spectrum efficiency for Wi-Fi and other wireless systems. As an enabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as the channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel state information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent Generative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission where licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and transform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which converts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared characteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative networks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses to fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled networks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting synchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference process, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation accuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of 5-17 dB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability. We further show that the sum rate performance assisted by CF-CGN-based CF is close to that with perfect CSI for multi-band massive MIMO transmission.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting-assisted Non-orthogonal Pilot Allocation for Uplink XL-MIMO Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is critical to future wireless networks. The substantial increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas introduces near-field propagation effects in the wireless channels, complicating channel parameter estimation and increasing pilot overhead. Channel charting (CC) has emerged as a potent unsupervised technique to effectively harness varying high-dimensional channel statistics to enable non-orthogonal pilot assignment and reduce pilot overhead. In this paper, we investigate near-field channel estimation with reduced pilot overhead by developing a CC-assisted pilot scheduling. To this end, we introduce a polar-domain codebook to capture the power distribution of near-field XL-MIMO channels. The CC-assisted approach uses such features as inputs to enable an effective low-dimensional mapping of the inherent correlation patterns in near-field user terminal (UT) channels. Building upon the mapped channel correlations, we further propose a near-field CC-assisted pilot allocation (NCC-PA) algorithm, which efficiently enhances channel orthogonality among pilot-reusing UTs. Numerical results confirm that the NCC-PA algorithm substantially elevates the wireless transmission performance, offering a marked improvement over the conventional far-field CC-PA approach.</description>

      <title>DeepF-fNet: a physics-informed neural network for vibration isolation optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural optimization is essential for designing safe, efficient, and durable components with minimal material usage. Traditional methods for vibration control often rely on active systems to mitigate unpredictable vibrations, which may lead to resonance and potential structural failure. However, these methods face significant challenges when addressing the nonlinear inverse eigenvalue problems required for optimizing structures subjected to a wide range of frequencies. As a result, no existing approach has effectively addressed the need for real-time vibration suppression within this context, particularly in high-performance environments such as automotive noise, vibration and harshness, where computational efficiency is crucial.
  This study introduces DeepF-fNet, a novel neural network framework designed to replace traditional active systems in vibration-based structural optimization. Leveraging DeepONets within the context of physics-informed neural networks, DeepF-fNet integrates both data and the governing physical laws. This enables rapid identification of optimal parameters to suppress critical vibrations at specific frequencies, offering a more efficient and real-time alternative to conventional methods.
  The proposed framework is validated through a case study involving a locally resonant metamaterial used to isolate structures from user-defined frequency ranges. The results demonstrate that DeepF-fNet outperforms traditional genetic algorithms in terms of computational speed while achieving comparable results, making it a promising tool for vibration-sensitive applications. By replacing active systems with machine learning techniques, DeepF-fNet paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective structural optimization in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attack and Defense for LoRa Device Identification and Authentication via Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRa provides long-range, energy-efficient communications in Internet of Things (IoT) applications that rely on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) capabilities. Despite these merits, concerns persist regarding the security of LoRa networks, especially in situations where device identification and authentication are imperative to secure the reliable access to the LoRa networks. This paper explores a deep learning (DL) approach to tackle these concerns, focusing on two critical tasks, namely (i) identifying LoRa devices and (ii) classifying them to legitimate and rogue devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs), encompassing both convolutional and feedforward neural networks, are trained for these tasks using actual LoRa signal data. In this setting, the adversaries may spoof rogue LoRa signals through the kernel density estimation (KDE) method based on legitimate device signals that are received by the adversaries. Two cases are considered, (i) training two separate classifiers, one for each of the two tasks, and (ii) training a multi-task classifier for both tasks. The vulnerabilities of the resulting DNNs to manipulations in input samples are studied in form of untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Individual and common perturbations are considered against single-task and multi-task classifiers for the LoRa signal analysis. To provide resilience against such attacks, a defense approach is presented by increasing the robustness of classifiers with adversarial training. Results quantify how vulnerable LoRa signal classification tasks are to adversarial attacks and emphasize the need to fortify IoT applications against these subtle yet effective threats.</description>

      <title>Two-component spatiotemporal template for activation-inhibition of speech in ECoG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I compute the average trial-by-trial power of band-limited speech activity across epochs of multi-channel high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded from multiple subjects during a consonant-vowel speaking task. I show that previously seen anti-correlations of average beta frequency activity (12-35 Hz) to high-frequency gamma activity (70-140 Hz) during speech movement are observable between individual ECoG channels in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). With this I fit a variance-based model using principal component analysis to the band-powers of individual channels of session-averaged ECoG data in the SMC and project SMC channels onto their lower-dimensional principal components.
  Spatiotemporal relationships between speech-related activity and principal components are identified by correlating the principal components of both frequency bands to individual ECoG channels over time using windowed correlation. Correlations of principal component areas to sensorimotor areas reveal a distinct two-component activation-inhibition-like representation for speech that resembles distinct local sensorimotor areas recently shown to have complex interplay in whole-body motor control, inhibition, and posture. Notably the third principal component shows insignificant correlations across all subjects, suggesting two components of ECoG are sufficient to represent SMC activity during speech movement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In time division duplexing (TDD) millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) can be obtained from uplink channel estimation thanks to channel reciprocity. However, under high-mobility scenarios, frequent uplink channel estimation is needed due to channel aging. Additionally, large amounts of antennas and subcarriers result in high-dimensional CSI matrices, aggravating pilot training overhead. To address this, we propose a three-domain (3D) channel extrapolation framework across spatial, frequency, and temporal domains. First, considering the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven channel estimation methods and the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial and frequency domains, a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel extrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) is proposed for uplink channel estimation via joint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce spatial-frequency domain pilot overhead. Then, leveraging channel reciprocity and temporal dependencies, we propose a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation network (TUDCEN) powered by generative artificial intelligence for slot-level channel extrapolation, aiming to reduce the tremendous temporal domain pilot overhead caused by high mobility. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in significantly reducing the pilot training overhead by 16 times and improving the system's spectral efficiency under high-mobility scenarios compared with state-of-the-art channel estimation/extrapolation methods.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Wave-Number Domain Expression for Near-Field XL-array Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) technology advances and carrier frequency rises, the near-field effects in communication are intensifying. In near-field conditions, channels exhibit a diffusion phenomenon in the angular domain, existing research indicates that this phenomenon can be leveraged for efficient parameter estimation and beam training. However, the channel model in angular domain lacks closed-form analysis, making the time complexity of the corresponding algorithm high. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the near-field diffusion effect in the wave-number domain, where the wave-number domain can be viewed as the continuous form of the angular domain. A closed-form approximate wave-number domain expression is proposed, based on the Principle of Stationary Phase. Subsequently, we derive a simplified expression for the case where the user distance is much larger than the array aperture, which is more concise. Subsequently, we verify the accuracy of the proposed approximate expression through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness using a beam training example. Results indicate that the beam training scheme, improved by the wave-number domain approximation model, can effectively estimate near-field user parameters and perform beam training using far-field DFT codebooks. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of existing DFT codebook-based beam training methods.</description>

      <title>ESI-GAL: EEG Source Imaging-based Trajectory Estimation for Grasp and Lift Task</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Interleaved Pilots to Extend the Region of Predictable Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the delay period of the Zak-OTFS carrier is greater than the delay spread of the channel, and the Doppler period of the carrier is greater than the Doppler spread of the channel, the effective channel filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single pilot carrier waveform. The input-output (I/O) relation can then be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. We introduce a framework for pilot design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain which makes it possible to support users with very different delay-Doppler characteristics when it is not possible to choose a single delay and Doppler period to support all users. The method is to interleave single pilots in the DD domain, and to choose the pilot spacing so that the I/O relation can be reconstructed by solving a small linear system of equations.</description>

      <title>EEG Right &amp; Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding extracellular recordings is a crucial task in electrophysiology and brain-computer interfaces. Spike sorting, which distinguishes spikes and their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, becomes computationally demanding with the increasing number of channels in modern neural probes. To address the intensive workload and complex neuron interactions, we propose E-Sort, an end-to-end neural network-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing. Our framework reduces the required number of annotated spikes for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.68% higher accuracy. Additionally, our novel post-processing algorithm is compatible with deep learning frameworks, making E-Sort significantly faster than state-of-the-art spike sorters. On synthesized Neuropixels recordings, E-Sort achieves comparable accuracy with Kilosort4 while sorting 50 seconds of data in only 1.32 seconds. Our method demonstrates robustness across various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift conditions, offering a substantial improvement in both accuracy and runtime efficiency compared to existing spike sorters.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Multi-Environment Mixed Q-Learning for Partially Decentralized Wireless Network Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-learning is a powerful tool for network control and policy optimization in wireless networks, but it struggles with large state spaces. Recent advancements, like multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ), improves performance and reduces complexity by integrating multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple related environments so-called digital cousins. However, MEMQ is designed for centralized single-agent networks and is not suitable for decentralized or multi-agent networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ algorithm for partially decentralized wireless networks with multiple mobile transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs), where TXs do not have access to each other's states and actions. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state based on local observations and share limited information with leader TX to minimize joint cost. The cost of information sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. The proposed scheme is 50% faster than centralized MEMQ with only a 20% increase in average policy error (APE) and is 25% faster than several advanced decentralized Q-learning algorithms with 40% less APE. The convergence of the algorithm is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. We recognize that any RIS control circuit can always be separated into its static parts (SLC) and a set of tunable individual loads (IL). Therefore, a BD-RIS-parametrized channel results from the chain cascade of three systems: i) radio environment (RE), ii) SLC, and iii) IL. RE and SLC are static non-diagonal systems whose cascade K is terminated by the tunable diagonal system IL. This physics-compliant representation in terms of K and IL is directly analogous to that for conventional ("diagonal") RIS (D-RIS). Therefore, scenarios with BD-RIS can also readily be captured by the physics-compliant coupled-dipole model PhysFad, as we show. In addition, physics-compliant algorithms for system-level optimization with D-RIS can be directly applied to scenarios with BD-RIS. We demonstrate this important implication of our conceptual finding in a case study on end-to-end channel estimation and optimization in a BD-RIS-parametrized rich-scattering environment. Our case study is the first experimentally grounded system-level optimization for BD-RIS: We obtain the characteristics of RE and IL from experimental measurements and a commercial PIN diode, respectively. Altogether, our physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS enables a paradigm shift in how practitioners in wireless communications and signal processing implement system-level optimizations for BD-RIS because it enables them to directly apply existing physics-compliant D-RIS algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</description>

Abstract: This correspondence presents a probabilistic generalization of the Generalized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA. The GOSPA metric is widely used to evaluate the distance between finite sets, particularly in multi-object estimation applications. The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA into the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization, missed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner. Examples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed P-GOSPA metric.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of pure-feedback system with full-state constraints. With the help of Mean-Value Theorem, the pure-feedback nonlinear system is transformed into strict-feedback case. By employing finite-time-stable like function and state transformation for output tracking error, the output tracking error converges to a predefined set in a fixed finite interval. To tackle the problem of state constraints, integral Barrier Lyapunov functions are utilized to guarantee that the state variables remain within the prescribed constraints with feasibility check. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. In addition, all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semi-global ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Nonlinear State Constrained Pure-Feedback Systems With Input Delay via Dynamic Surface Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This brief constructs the adaptive backstepping control scheme for a class of pure-feedback systems with input delay and full state constraints. With the help of Mean Value Theorem, the pure-feedback system is transformed into strict-feedback one. Barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee all of the states remain constrained within predefined sets. By introducing the Pade approximation method and corresponding intermediate, the impact generated by input delay on the output tracking performance of the system can be eliminated. Furthermore, a low-pass filter driven by a newly-defined control input, is employed to generate the actual control input, which facilitates the design of backstepping control. To approximate the unknown functions with a desired level of accuracy, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized by choosing appropriate fuzzy rules, logics and so on. The minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique is employed to decrease the number of nodes and parameters in FLSs, and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is leveraged to avoid so-called "explosion of complexity". Moreover, smooth robust compensators are introduced to circumvent the influences of external disturbance and approximation errors. By stability analysis, it is proved that all of signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately uniform bounded, and the tracking error can be within a arbitrary small neighbor of origin via selecting appropriate parameters of controllers. Finally, the results of numerical illustration are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Semi-Autonomous Robotic Arm Manipulation Operator Intention Detection from Force Data</title>

Abstract: In hazardous environments like nuclear facilities, robotic systems are essential for executing tasks that would otherwise expose humans to dangerous radiation levels, which pose severe health risks and can be fatal. However, many operations in the nuclear environment require teleoperating robots, resulting in a significant cognitive load on operators as well as physical strain over extended periods of time. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing the teleoperation system with an assistive model capable of predicting operator intentions and dynamically adapting to their needs. The machine learning model processes robotic arm force data, analyzing spatiotemporal patterns to accurately detect the ongoing task before its completion. To support this approach, we collected a diverse dataset from teleoperation experiments involving glovebox tasks in nuclear applications. This dataset encompasses heterogeneous spatiotemporal data captured from the teleoperation system. We employ a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to learn and forecast operator intentions based on the spatiotemporal data. By accurately predicting these intentions, the robot can execute tasks more efficiently and effectively, requiring minimal input from the operator. Our experiments validated the model using the dataset, focusing on tasks such as radiation surveys and object grasping. The proposed approach demonstrated an F1-score of 89% for task classification and an F1-score of 86% classification forecasted operator intentions over a 5-second window.

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085</link>

Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.

      <title>BlueME: Robust Underwater Robot-to-Robot Communication Using Compact Magnetoelectric Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Index Modulation for MIMO Systems: Robust Transmission and Low-Complexity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna (FA) index modulation (IM)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, referred to as FA-IM, significantly enhances spectral efficiency (SE) compared to the conventional FA-assisted MIMO system. To improve robustness against the high spatial correlation among multiple activated ports of the fluid antenna, this paper proposes an innovative FA grouping-based IM (FAG-IM) system. A block grouping scheme is employed based on the spatial correlation model and the distribution structure of the ports. Then, a closed-form expression for the average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound of the FAG-IM system is derived. To reduce the complexity of the receiver, the message passing architecture is incorporated into the FAG-IM system. Building on this, an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) detector, named structured AMP (S-AMP) detector, is proposed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the transmitted signals. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAG-IM system significantly outperforms the existing FA-IM system in the presence of spatial correlation, achieving more robust transmission. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed low-complexity S-AMP detector not only reduces time complexity to a linear scale but also substantially improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector, thereby enhancing the practical feasibility of the FAG-IM system.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Signal Classification Model for Automatic Modulation Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of radar signals demands responsive and accurate detection systems that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing models, while effective, often rely on substantial computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for edge deployment. In this work, we propose an ultralight hybrid neural network optimized for edge applications, delivering robust performance across unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios (mean accuracy of 96.3% at 0 dB) using less than 100 samples per class, and significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>
