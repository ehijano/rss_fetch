      <title>Risk-Based Capacity Accreditation of Resource-Colocated Large Loads in Capacity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study capacity accreditation of resource-colocated large loads, defined as large demands such as data center and manufacturing loads colocated with behind-the-meter generation and storage resources, synchronously connected to the bulk power system, and capable of participating in the wholesale electricity market as an integrated unit. Because the qualified capacity of a resource portfolio is not equal to the sum of its individual resources' qualified capacities, we propose a novel risk-based capacity accreditation framework that evaluates the collective contribution to system reliability. Grounded in the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) metric, the proposed capacity accreditation employs a convex optimization engine that jointly dispatches colocated resources to minimize reliability risk. We apply the developed methodology to a hydrogen manufacturing facility with colocated renewable generation, storage, and fuel cell resources.</description>

      <title>Safety and Risk Pathways in Cooperative Generative Multi-Agent Systems: A Telecom Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative multiagent systems are rapidly emerging as transformative tools for scalable automation and adaptive decisionmaking in telecommunications. Despite their promise, these systems introduce novel risks that remain underexplored, particularly when agents operate asynchronously across layered architectures. This paper investigates key safety pathways in telecomfocused Generative MultiAgent Systems (GMAS), emphasizing risks of miscoordination and semantic drift shaped by persona diversity. We propose a modular safety evaluation framework that integrates agentlevel checks on code quality and compliance with systemlevel safety metrics. Using controlled simulations across 32 persona sets, five questions, and multiple iterative runs, we demonstrate progressive improvements in analyzer penalties and AllocatorCoder consistency, alongside persistent vulnerabilities such as policy drift and variability under specific persona combinations. Our findings provide the first domaingrounded evidence that persona design, coding style, and planning orientation directly influence the stability and safety of telecom GMAS, highlighting both promising mitigation strategies and open risks for future deployment.</description>

      <title>Generative Model Predictive Control in Manufacturing Processes: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Online Stability Lobe Diagram Estimation and Chatter Suppression Control in Milling Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatter is a self-excited vibration in milling that degrades surface quality and accelerates tool wear. This paper presents an adaptive process controller that suppresses chatter by leveraging machine learning-based online estimation of the Stability Lobe Diagram (SLD) and surface roughness in the process. Stability analysis is conducted using the semi-discretization method for milling dynamics modeled by delay differential equations. An integrated machine learning framework estimates the SLD from sensor data and predicts surface roughness for chatter detection in real time. These estimates are integrated into an optimal controller that adaptively adjusts spindle speed to maintain process stability and improve surface finish. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the superior performance compared to the existing approaches.</description>

      <title>On the stability of event-based control with neuronal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based control, unlike analogue control, poses significant analytical challenges due to its hybrid dynamics. This work investigates the stability and inter-event time properties of a control-affine system under event-based impulsive control. The controller consists of multiple neuronal units with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics acting on a time-invariant, multiple-input multiple-output plant in closed loop. Both the plant state and the neuronal units exhibit discontinuities that cancel if combined linearly, enabling a direct correspondence between the event-based impulsive controller and a corresponding analogue controller. Leveraging this observation, we prove global practical stability of the event-based impulsive control system. In the general nonlinear case, we show that the event-based impulsive controller ensures global practical asymptotic stability if the analogue system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to specific disturbances. In the linear case, we further show global practical exponential stability if the analogue system is stable. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. The findings reveal a fundamental link between analogue and event-based impulsive control, providing new insights for the design of neuromorphic controllers.</description>

      <title>Sparse Kalman Identification for Partially Observable Systems via Adaptive Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).</description>

      <title>Sparse Broad Learning System via Sequential Threshold Least-Squares for Nonlinear System Identification under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Broad Learning System (BLS) has gained significant attention for its computational efficiency and less network parameters compared to deep learning structures. However, the standard BLS relies on the pseudoinverse solution, which minimizes the mean square error with $L_2$-norm but lacks robustness against sensor noise and outliers common in industrial environments. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Broad Learning System (S-BLS) framework. Instead of the traditional ridge regression, we incorporate the Sequential Threshold Least-Squares (STLS) algorithm -- originally utilized in the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) -- into the output weight learning process of BLS. By iteratively thresholding small coefficients, the proposed method promotes sparsity in the output weights, effectively filtering out noise components while maintaining modeling accuracy. This approach falls under the category of sparse regression and is particularly suitable for noisy environments. Experimental results on a numerical nonlinear system and a noisy Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and achieves superior robustness compared to standard BLS.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Lane-Level Crash Detection on Freeways Using Sparse Telematics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time traffic crash detection is critical in intelligent transportation systems because traditional crash notifications often suffer delays and lack specific, lane-level location information, which can lead to safety risks and economic losses. This paper proposes a real-time, lane-level crash detection approach for freeways that only leverages sparse telematics trajectory data. In the offline stage, the historical trajectories are discretized into spatial cells using vector cross-product techniques, and then used to estimate a vehicle intention distribution and select an alert threshold by maximizing the F1-score based on official crash reports. In the online stage, incoming telematics records are mapped to these cells and scored for three modules: transition anomalies, speed deviations, and lateral maneuver risks, with scores accumulated into a cell-specific risk map. When any cell's risk exceeds the alert threshold, the system issues a prompt warning. Relying solely on telematics data, this real-time and low-cost solution is evaluated on a Wisconsin dataset and validated against official crash reports, achieving a 75% crash identification rate with accurate lane-level localization, an overall accuracy of 96%, an F1-score of 0.84, and a non-crash-to-crash misclassification rate of only 0.6%, while also detecting 13% of crashes more than 3 minutes before the recorded crash time.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Driving Profile for Vehicle Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate mass estimation is essential for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous heavy-duty vehicles, particularly during transportation missions in unstructured environments such as mining sites, where vehicle mass can vary significantly due to loading and unloading. While prior work has recognized the importance of acceleration profiles for estimation accuracy, the systematic design of driving profiles during transport has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents a framework for designing driving profiles to support accurate mass estimation. Based on application-oriented input design, it aims to meet a user-defined accuracy constraint under three optimization objectives: minimum-time, minimum-distance, and maximum accuracy (within a fixed time). It allows time- and distance-dependent bounds on acceleration and velocity, and is based on a Newtonian vehicle dynamics model with actuator dynamics. The optimal profiles are obtained by solving concave optimization problems using a branch-and-bound method, with alternative rank-constrained and semi-definite relaxations also discussed. Theoretical analysis provides insights into the optimal profiles, including feasibility conditions, key ratios between velocity and acceleration bounds, and trade-offs between time- and distance-optimal solutions. The framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on a Scania truck with different payloads. Results show that the designed profiles are feasible and effective, enabling accurate mass estimation as part of normal transportation operations without requiring dedicated calibration runs. An additional contribution is a non-causal Wiener filter, with parameters estimated via the Empirical Bayes method, used to filter the accelerometer signal with no phase-lag.</description>

      <title>Energy Control Strategy to Enhance AC Fault Ride-Through in Offshore Wind MMC-HVDC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular Multilevel Converter-based High Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) system is a promising technology for integration of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, onshore AC faults on MMC-HVDC reduce the power transfer capability of onshore converter station, leading to surplus power accumulation in HVDC link. This surplus power causes a rapid rise in DC-link voltage and may hinder safe operation of OWFs. To address such a situation, this paper presents an AC fault ride-through scheme that combines the storage of surplus power in MMC submodule (SM) capacitors and dissipation of residual power in an energy dissipation device (EDD). The proposed energy control facilitates use of half-bridge MMC SMs with low-capacitance, with their storage capacity leveraged to share the surplus power during faults, with a lower-rated EDD. The proposed scheme is tested on a 640kV/420MW MMC-HVDC system. The results show that proposed control scheme effectively maintains DC link voltages, ensuring connection of OWFs.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and field testing of a residential heat pump retrofit for a DC solar nanogrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential buildings are increasingly integrating large devices that run natively on direct current (DC), such as solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and DC motors that drive heat pumps and other major appliances. Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements, a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization for Security and Reliability in Round-Trip Transmissions for URLLC services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is a potential solution for secure and reliable transmissions in future Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This work jointly optimizes redundant bits and blocklength allocation in practical round-trip transmission scenarios. To minimize the leakage-failure probability, a metric that jointly characterizes security and reliability in PLS, we formulate an optimization problem for allocating both redundant bits and blocklength. By deriving the boundaries of the feasible set, we obtain the globally optimal solution for this integer optimization problem. To achieve more computationally efficient solutions, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) method that exploits the partial convexity of the objective function. Subsequently, we develop a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm through convex approximation of the objective function, which further improves computational efficiency. Finally, we validate the performance of the three proposed approaches through simulations, demonstrating their practical applicability for future URLLC services.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity and L2 Stability of Large-Scale Networks with Changing Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Expiry Date: Uncovering Hidden Value in Functional Drink Waste for a Circular Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expired functional drinks have great valorisation potential due to the high concentration of organic molecules present. However, detailed information of the resources in these expired functional drinks is limited, hindering the rational design of a recovery system. To address this gap, we present here a study that comprehensively characterises the chemical composition of functional drinks and discus their potential use as feedstocks for biomethane production. The example functional drinks were abundant in sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, and were especially rich in glucose, fructose, and alanine. Our studies revealed that functional drinks with high COD values that corresponded to high proportions of sugar and organic acid and low proportions of sorbitol and amino acids could realise profitable recovery through anaerobic digestion, with a minimum biomethane yield of 11.72 mL CH4 / mL drink. To assess utility further we also examined the dynamic composition of functional drinks up to 16 weeks (at 4 {\deg}C) after expiration to capture the shift in resources during deterioration. In doing so, we identified 4 distinct periods of carbon resource variation: 1) chemically stable period, 2) sorbitol degradation period, 3) sugar degradation period, and 4) acidification period. Based on the time-course biomethane production experiments for expired functional drinks, the optimal operating time window for biomethane production from drinks without ascorbic acid would be after sorbitol degradation period in terms of its economic performance through convenient natural deterioration. Therefore, this comprehensive study on dynamic chemical composition in expired functional drinks and their biomethane production potential could facilitate a rational design of resource recovery system for soft drink field.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.
  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.
  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation-Based Guidance Law for Powered Descent Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new guidance law for powered descent landing of a rocket-powered vehicle. The proposed law derives the acceleration command for a point mass model of the vehicle by expressing velocity as a dynamical system undergoing supercritical transcritical bifurcation with three bifurcation parameters. The parameters are designed such that the stable equilibrium points of the velocity dynamics correspond to the guided targeting state, that is, the landing point. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the working of the proposed guidance law.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Transformer Energization Sequence for Inverter Based Resources in Black-Start Procedures with Active Flux Trajectory Manipulation in the Stationary Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes advanced soft-magnetization techniques to enable ultra-fast and reliable black-start of grid-forming (GFM) converters. Conventional hard-magnetization with well-established three-phase voltages during transformer energization induces severe inrush currents due to flux offset, which can damage power semiconductor devices. To overcome this drawback, an ultra-fast soft-magnetization method is firstly introduced, leveraging the voltage programmability of the inverter to actively reshape the initial voltage profile and thereby eliminate flux offset of the transformer core. By suppressing the formation of flux offset itself, the proposed approach prevents magnetic saturation and achieves nominal terminal voltage within a few milliseconds while effectively suppressing inrush current. However, this method can still trigger surge currents to power semiconductor devices in the presence of an LC filter due to abrupt voltage magnitude and phase transitions. To address this issue, an enhanced Archimedean spiral soft-magnetization method is developed, where both voltage magnitude and phase evolve smoothly to simultaneously suppress inrush and surge currents. Furthermore, residual flux in the transformer core is considered, and a demagnetization sequence using the inverter is validated to ensure reliable start-up. Experimental results confirm that the proposed methods achieve rapid black-start performance within one fundamental cycle while ensuring safe and stable operation of GFM converters.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Tracking Control for Fully Actuated Mechanical Systems on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical control systems such as aerial, marine, space, and terrestrial robots often naturally admit a state-space that has the structure of a Lie group. The kinetic energy of such systems is commonly invariant to the induced action by the Lie group, and the system dynamics can be written as a coupled ordinary differential equation on the group and the dual space of its Lie algebra, termed a Lie-Poisson system. In this paper, we show that Lie-Poisson systems can also be written as a left-invariant system on a semi-direct Lie group structure placed on the trivialised cotangent bundle of the symmetry group. The authors do not know of a prior reference for this observation and we are confident the insight has never been exploited in the context of tracking control. We use this representation to build a right-invariant tracking error for the full state of a Lie-Poisson mechanical system and show that the error dynamics for this error are themselves of Lie-Poisson structure, albeit with time-varying inertia. This allows us to tackle the general trajectory tracking problem using an energy shaping design metholodology. To demonstrate the approach, we apply the proposed design methodology to a simple attitude tracking control.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Assisted Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure with Real-World Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</description>

      <title>Impact Analysis of COVID-19 in Bangladesh Power Sector and Recommendations based on Practical Data and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the power sector in Bangladesh, how the country has dealt with it, and explores the path to stability. The study employs data visualisation and complex statistics to examine critical data about power systems in Bangladesh. This includes load patterns on a daily, monthly, annual, weekend, and weekday basis. Significant alterations in these patterns have been observed during our study e.g., in April and May of 2020, the power demand decreased by approximately 15.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. We have used a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to predict the load profile of 2020 excluding COVID-19 effects. This model is compared with the actual load profile to determine the degree to which COVID-19 has impacted. The comparison indicates that the average power demand decreased by approximately 19.5% in April 2020 and 18.3% in May 2020, relative to its projected value. The study also investigates system stability by analyzing transmission loss and load factor, and the environmental effect by analyzing the Carbon Dioxide emission rate. Finally, the study provides recommendations for overcoming future disasters, such as developing more resilient power systems, investing in renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>PolyOCP.jl -- A Julia Package for Stochastic OCPs and MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consideration of stochastic uncertainty in optimal and predictive control is a well-explored topic. Recently Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) have seen a lot of considerations for problems involving stochastically uncertain system parameters and also for problems with additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances. While there exist a number of open-source PCE toolboxes, tailored open-source codes for the solution of OCPs involving additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances in julia are not available. Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox PolyOCP.jl which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions. We explain the main mathematical concepts between the PCE transcription of stochastic OCPs and how they are provided in the toolbox. We draw upon two examples to illustrate the functionalities of PolyOCP.jl.</description>

      <title>Optimal policy design for innovation diffusion: shaping today's incentives for transforming the future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for the design of incentives aimed at promoting innovation diffusion in social influence networks. In particular, our framework relies on an extension of the Friedkin and Johnsen opinion dynamics model characterizing the effects of (i) short-memory incentives, which have an immediate yet transient impact, and (ii) long-term structural incentives, whose impact persists via an exponentially decaying memory. We propose to design these incentives via a model-predictive control (MPC) scheme over an augmented state that captures the memory in our opinion dynamics model, yielding a convex quadratic program with linear constraints. Our numerical simulations based on data on sustainable mobility habits show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which balances large-scale adoption and resource allocation</description>

      <title>Data-driven certificates of constraint enforcement and stability for unmodeled, discrete dynamical systems using tree data structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing data-driven certificates for the stability and safety of unmodeled dynamical systems by leveraging a tree data structure and an upper bound of the system's Lipschitz constant. Previously, an invariant set was synthesized by iteratively expanding an initial invariant set. In contrast, this work iteratively prunes the constraint set to synthesize an invariant set -- eliminating the need for a known, initial invariant set. Furthermore, we provide stability assurances by characterizing the asymptotic stability of the system relative to an invariant approximation of the minimal positive invariant set through synthesis of a discontinuous piecewise affine Lyapunov function over the computed invariant set. The proposed method takes inspiration from subdivision techniques and requires no prior system knowledge beyond Lipschitz continuity.</description>

      <title>Innovative Modular Design and Kinematic Approach based on Screw Theory for Triple Scissors Links Deployable Space Antenna Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the geometry design and analysis of a novel triple scissors links deployable antenna mechanism (TSDAM) to deal with the problems of large aperture and high precision space antennas for deep space communication and Earth observation. This mechanism has only one degree of freedom (DoF) and thus makes for efficient and reliable deployment without loss of structural integrity. It employed a systematic design approach starting from a triple scissors links modular unit to a 25m aperture assembly. Different configurations constituting variable numbers of modular units were analyzed in SolidWorks to identify the deployable mechanism with lowest deformation. While the 24 units configuration offered superior stowage compactness, it exhibited higher deformation (0.01437mm), confirming the 12 units configuration as the optimal balance between structural stability and deployment efficiency. Screw theory was employed to analyze the kinematic properties, and numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB and SolidWorks. The deployable space antenna showed transition from stowed to fully deployed state in just 53 seconds with high stability throughout the deployment process. The TSDAM attained a storage ratio of up to 15.3 for height and volume with 0.01048mm of deformation for a 12 units configuration. Mesh convergence analysis proved the consistency of the simulation results for 415314 tetrahedral shaped elements. The virtual experiments in SolidWorks verified the analytical Screw theory based model and ensured that the design was smooth and flexible for deployment in operational conditions. The research establishes a robust design framework for future deployable antennas, offering enhanced performance, simplified structure, and improved reliability</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Learning-to-Optimize Framework for Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-to-optimize (L2O) framework to accelerate solving parametric mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems, with a particular focus on mixed-integer model predictive control (MI-MPC) applications. The framework learns to predict integer solutions with enhanced optimality and feasibility by integrating supervised learning (for optimality), self-supervised learning (for feasibility), and a differentiable quadratic programming (QP) layer, resulting in a hybrid L2O framework. Specifically, a neural network (NN) is used to learn the mapping from problem parameters to optimal integer solutions, while a differentiable QP layer is integrated to compute the corresponding continuous variables given the predicted integers and problem parameters. Moreover, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which combines a supervised loss with respect to the global optimal solution, and a self-supervised loss derived from the problem's objective and constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two benchmark MI-MPC problems, with comparative results against purely supervised and self-supervised learning models.</description>

      <title>Data driven synthesis of provable invariant sets via stochastically sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive invariant (PI) sets are essential for ensuring safety, i.e. constraint adherence, of dynamical systems. With the increasing availability of sampled data from complex (and often unmodeled) systems, it is advantageous to leverage these data sets for PI set synthesis. This paper uses data driven geometric conditions of invariance to synthesize PI sets from data. Where previous data driven, set-based approaches to PI set synthesis used deterministic sampling schemes, this work instead synthesizes PI sets from any pre-collected data sets. Beyond a data set and Lipschitz continuity, no additional information about the system is needed. A tree data structure is used to partition the space and select samples used to construct the PI set, while Lipschitz continuity is used to provide deterministic guarantees of invariance. Finally, probabilistic bounds are given on the number of samples needed for the algorithm to determine of a certain volume.</description>

      <title>AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.</description>

      <title>Anti-Jamming based on Null-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms represent a key advancement in autonomous systems, enabling coordinated missions through inter-UAV communication. However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency.
  To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources.
  Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system.
  Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems.</description>

      <title>APULSE: A Scalable Hybrid Algorithm for the RCSPP on Large-Scale Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Latent Models for Task-specific Visual-Language Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.</description>

      <title>Explicit Bounds on the Hausdorff Distance for Truncated mRPI Sets via Norm-Dependent Contraction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first explicit and closed-form upper bound on the Hausdorff distance between the truncated minimal robust positively invariant (mRPI) set and its infinite-horizon limit. While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \( d_H(\mathcal{E}_N,\mathcal{E}_\infty) \le r_W\,\gamma^{N+1}/(1-\gamma), \) where $\gamma&lt;1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.</description>

      <title>On Linear Convergence of Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization over Undirected Networks via Gradient Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many large-scale constrained optimization problems can be formulated as bilevel distributed optimization tasks over undirected networks, where agents collaborate to minimize a global cost function while adhering to constraints, relying only on local communication and computation. In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.</description>

      <title>Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part B: Stochastic Stability in Weakly Acyclic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Workspace of Electromagnetic Navigation Systems Using Dynamic Feedback for Single- and Multi-agent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) enable a number of magnetically guided surgical procedures. A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils. The results demonstrate that feedback is a practical path to scalable, efficient, and clinically relevant magnetic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Online Smoothed Demand Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \&amp; aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.</description>

      <title>Generative Myopia: Why Diffusion Models Fail at Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Real-Time Mitigation Techniques for Cyber Security in IEC 61850 / IEC 62351 Substations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitalization of substations enlarges the cyber-attack surface, necessitating effective detection and mitigation of cyber attacks in digital substations. While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work.</description>

      <title>Semi-Passive IRS Enabled Sensing with Group Movable Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the sensing system is limited by the signal attenuation and the number of receiving components. In this letter, we investigate the sensor position selection in a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing system. The IRS consists of passive elements and active sensors, where the sensors can receive and process the echo signal for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Motivated by the movable antenna array and fluid antenna system, we consider the case where the sensors are integrated into a group for movement and derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Then, the optimal solution for the positions of the movable sensors (MSs) to the CRB minimization problem is derived in closed form. Moreover, we characterize the relationship between the CRB and system parameters. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MS scheme over the fixed-position (FP) scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a directional pinching-antenna system (DiPASS), a comprehensive framework that transitions PASS modeling from idealized abstraction to physical consistency. DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new "equal quota division" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization pathways for liquid fuels: A multi-sector energy system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-carbon liquid fuels play a key role in energy system decarbonization scenarios. This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework that enables emergent locomotion without relying on handcrafted gait patterns or predefined contact sequences. Our method discovers diverse motion patterns, ranging from trotting to galloping, robust standing policies, jumping, and handstand balancing, purely through the optimization of high-level objectives. Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities. In simulation, we further showcase more complex behaviors, such as backflips, dynamic handstand balancing and locomotion on a Humanoid, all without requiring reference tracking or offline pre-training.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Leader-Follower Consensus with Adversaries: A Multi-Hop Relay Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines resilient dynamic leader-follower consensus within multi-agent systems, where agents share first-order or second-order dynamics. The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. We accordingly derive a necessary and sufficient graph condition for our algorithms to succeed; also, our tracking error bounds are smaller than that of the existing method. Furthermore, it is emphasized that even when agents do not use relays, our condition is tighter than the sufficient conditions in the literature. With multi-hop relays, we can further obtain more relaxed graph requirements. Finally, we present numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear MPC for Feedback-Interconnected Systems: a Suboptimal and Reduced-Order Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a suboptimal and reduced-order Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture for discrete-time feedback-interconnected systems. The numerical MPC solver: (i) acts suboptimally, performing only a finite number of optimization iterations at each sampling instant, and (ii) relies only on a reduced-order model that neglects part of the system dynamics, either due to unmodeled effects or the presence of a low-level compensator. We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled. The theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on a mechatronic system consisting of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor.</description>

      <title>Learning to Admit Optimally in an $M/M/k/k+N$ Queueing System with Unknown Service Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of the Erlang-B blocking model and the extended $M/M/k/k+N$ model that allows for some queueing, beyond communication networks to sizing and pricing in production, messaging, and app-based parking systems, we study admission control for such systems with unknown service rate. In our model, a dispatcher either admits every arrival into the system (when there is room) or blocks it. Every served job yields a fixed reward but incurs a per unit time holding cost which includes the waiting time in the queue to get service if there is any. We aim to design a dispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward by observing arrival times and system state at arrivals, a realistic decision-event driven sampling of such systems. The dispatcher observes neither service times nor departure epochs, which excludes the use of reward-based reinforcement learning approaches. We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning problem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalent control switches between always admit if room (explore infinitely often), and never admit (terminate learning), so at judiciously chosen times we avoid the never admit recommendation. We prove that our proposed policy asymptotically converges to the optimal policy and present finite-time regret guarantees. The extreme contrast in the control policies shows up in our regret bounds for different parameter regimes: constant in one versus logarithmic in another.</description>

      <title>MHE under parametric uncertainty -- Robust state estimation without informative data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study joint state and parameter estimation for general nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters and persistent process and measurement noise. In particular, we are interested in stability properties of the resulting state estimate in the absence of persistency of excitation (PE). With a simple academic example, we show that existing moving horizon estimation (MHE) approaches for joint state and parameter estimation as well as classical adaptive observers can result in diverging state estimates in the absence of PE, even if the noise is small. We propose an MHE formulation involving a regularization based on a constant prior estimate of the unknown system parameters. Only assuming the existence of a stable state estimator, we prove that the proposed MHE approach results in practically robustly stable state estimates irrespective of PE. We discuss the relation of the proposed MHE formulation to state-of-the-art results from MHE and adaptive estimation. The properties of the proposed MHE approach are illustrated with a numerical example of a car with unknown tire friction parameters.</description>

      <title>How improving performance may imply losing consistency in event-triggered consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many settings. In particular, the performance properties of decentralized event-triggered control schemes with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we examine these performance properties for a consensus problem considering single-integrator agent dynamics, a level-triggering rule, and a complete communication graph. We consider the long-term average quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting, we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the relationship between two seemingly contrasting consistency results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Self-Refined Generative Foundation Models for Wireless Traffic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a broad range of emerging applications in 6G networks, wireless traffic prediction has become a critical component of network management. However, the dynamically shifting distribution of wireless traffic in non-stationary 6G networks presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and stable predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI)-enabled 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel self-refined Large Language Model (LLM) for wireless traffic prediction, namely TrafficLLM, through in-context learning without parameter fine-tuning or model training. The proposed TrafficLLM harnesses the powerful few-shot learning abilities of LLMs to enhance the scalability of traffic prediction in dynamically changing wireless environments. Specifically, our proposed TrafficLLM embraces an LLM to iteratively refine its predictions through a three-step process: traffic prediction, feedback generation, and prediction refinement. Initially, the proposed TrafficLLM conducts traffic predictions using task-specific demonstration prompts. Recognizing that LLMs may generate incorrect predictions on the first attempt, this paper designs feedback demonstration prompts to provide multifaceted and valuable feedback related to these initial predictions. The validation scheme is further incorporated to systematically enhance the accuracy of mathematical calculations during the feedback generation process. Following this comprehensive feedback, our proposed TrafficLLM introduces refinement demonstration prompts, enabling the same LLM to further refine its predictions and thereby enhance prediction performance. Evaluations on two realistic datasets demonstrate that the proposed TrafficLLM outperforms LLM-based in-context learning methods, achieving performance improvements of 23.17% and 17.09%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Neural Identification of Feedback-Stabilized Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. However, identifying these systems from closed-loop experimental data remains a challenge due to the correlations induced by the feedback loop. Traditional nonlinear closed-loop system identification methods struggle with reliance on precise noise models, robustness to data variations, or computational feasibility. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the identified model is stabilized by the same controller used during data collection, ensuring alignment with the true system's closed-loop behavior. The dual Youla parameterization provides a promising solution for linear systems, offering statistical guarantees and closed-loop stability. However, extending this approach to nonlinear systems presents additional complexities. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable framework for identifying complex, potentially unstable systems while ensuring closed-loop stability using a complete parameterization of systems stabilized by a given controller. We establish asymptotic consistency in the linear case and validate our method through numerical comparisons, demonstrating superior accuracy over direct identification baselines and compatibility with the true system in stability properties.</description>

      <title>Markov Potential Game Construction and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov games (MGs) provide a mathematical foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling self-interested agents to learn their optimal policies while interacting with others in a shared environment. However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has remained open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.</description>

      <title>Certifying the Nonexistence of Feasible Path Between Power System Operating Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By providing the optimal operating point that satisfies both the power flow equations and engineering limits, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is central to power systems operations. While extensive research has focused on computing high-quality OPF solutions, assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints. To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF test cases.</description>

      <title>The First Open-Source Framework for Learning Stability Certificates from Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before 2025, no open-source system existed that could learn Lyapunov stability certificates directly from noisy, real-world flight data. This work addresses that gap by proposing a data-driven approach that learns Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors that only flag deviations, the proposed method assesses whether the system can still be certified as stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS severe turbulence incident, this framework revealed that, within 60 seconds of the aircraft's descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be constructed to certify system stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first application of a data-driven Lyapunov-based stability verification method to real civil aviation data, achieved without any access to proprietary controller logic. The proposed framework is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability</description>

      <title>Revealing Chaotic Dependence and Degree-Structure Mechanisms in Optimal Pinning Control of Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here, leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines. Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful to safely synthesize control policies for physical systems using reinforcement learning, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed.

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study policy evaluation in continuous-time reinforcement learning, where the state follows an unknown stochastic differential equation (SDE) but only discrete-time data are available. We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth SDE structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification. In contrast to existing RL analyses that diverges as the sampling interval shrinks, the approximation error of PhiBE remains remains well-conditioned and independent of the discretization step by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gaussian Process Pre-Optimization for Asynchronous Event-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras, as bio-inspired sensors, are asynchronously triggered with high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process (TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.</description>

      <title>RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Free Energy Principle for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Simulator for Electrically Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software.
  This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drive Anywhere with Model-Based Reannotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.</description>

      <title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</description>

      <title>Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cram\'er Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.</description>
