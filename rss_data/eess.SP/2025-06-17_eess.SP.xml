      <title>A Tutorial-cum-Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Wi-Fi Sensing: Trends, Challenges, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi technology has evolved from simple communication routers to sensing devices. Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract and analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity detection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By leveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving, non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not sensitive to lighting conditions. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the Wi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces fundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement methods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a simplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a qualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their specifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of preprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature extraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then provide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi sensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that context. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive learning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative analysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting emerging technologies that can be leveraged to enhance the performance of Wi-Fi sensing and opportunities for further research in this domain</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital predistortion (DPD) is essential for mitigating nonlinearity in RF power amplifiers, particularly for wideband applications. This paper presents TCN-DPD, a parameter-efficient architecture based on temporal convolutional networks, integrating noncausal dilated convolutions with optimized activation functions. Evaluated on the OpenDPD framework with the DPA_200MHz dataset, TCN-DPD achieves simulated ACPRs of -51.58/-49.26 dBc (L/R), EVM of -47.52 dB, and NMSE of -44.61 dB with 500 parameters and maintains superior linearization than prior models down to 200 parameters, making it promising for efficient wideband PA linearization.</description>

      <title>Directed Acyclic Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset (CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Channel Estimation for Downlink Communications Based on Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner, delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates, without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Model-Driven Generative Channels for Double RIS-Aided Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation networks (6G), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention due to its ability of reconfiguring wireless channels via smart reflections. However, traditional channel state information (CSI) acquisition techniques for double-RIS systems face challenges (e.g., high pilot overhead or multipath interference). This paper proposes a new channel generation method in double-RIS communication systems based on the tool of conditional diffusion model (CDM). The CDM is trained on synthetic channel data to capture channel characteristics. It addresses the limitations of traditional CSI generation methods, such as insufficient model understanding capability and poor environmental adaptability. We provide a detailed analysis of the diffusion process for channel generation, and it is validated through simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CDM based method outperforms traditional channel acquisition methods in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE). This method offers a new paradigm for channel acquisition in double-RIS systems, which is expected to improve the quality of channel acquisition with low pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scheduling for Enhanced Performance in RIS-assisted Cooperative Network with Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as transformative technologies, enhancing spectral efficiency and improving interference management in multi-user cooperative communications. This paper investigates the integration of RIS with Flexible-Duplex (FlexD) communication, featuring dynamic scheduling capabilities, to mitigate unintended external interference in multi-user wireless networks. By leveraging the reconfigurability of RIS and dynamic scheduling, we propose a user-pair selection scheme to maximize system throughput when full channel state information (CSI) of interference is unavailable. We develop a mathematical framework to evaluate the throughput outage probability when RIS introduces spatial correlation. The derived analytical results are used for asymptotic analysis, providing insights into dynamic user scheduling under interference based on statistical channel knowledge. Finally, we compare FlexD with traditional Full Duplex (FD) and Half Duplex (HD) systems against RIS-assisted FlexD. Our results show FlexD's superior throughput enhancement, energy efficiency and data management capability in interference-affected networks, typical in current and next-generation cooperative wireless applications like cellular and vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced Sub-THz ISAC Transmission for Air-Ground Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within sub-THz frequencies is crucial for future air-ground networks, but unique propagation characteristics and hardware limitations present challenges in optimizing ISAC performance while increasing operational latency. This paper introduces a multi-modal sensing fusion framework inspired by synesthesia of machine (SoM) to enhance sub-THz ISAC transmission. By exploiting inherent degrees of freedom in sub-THz hardware and channels, the framework optimizes the radio-frequency environment. Squint-aware beam management is developed to improve air-ground network adaptability, enabling three-dimensional dynamic ISAC links. Leveraging multi-modal information, the framework enhances ISAC performance and reduces latency. Visual data rapidly localizes users and targets, while a customized multi-modal learning algorithm optimizes the hybrid precoder. A new metric provides comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves ISAC efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Terrestrial Interference Detection for Satellite-to-Device Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device communication is a promising future direction due to its lower latency and enhanced efficiency. However, intermittent and unpredictable terrestrial interference significantly affects system reliability and performance. Continuously employing sophisticated interference mitigation techniques is practically inefficient. Motivated by the periodic idle intervals characteristic of burst-mode satellite transmissions, this paper investigates online interference detection frameworks specifically tailored for satellite-to-device scenarios. We first rigorously formulate interference detection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, leveraging differences between Rayleigh (no interference) and Rice (interference present) distributions. Then, we propose a cumulative sum (CUSUM)-based online detector for scenarios with known interference directions, explicitly characterizing the trade-off between detection latency and false alarm rate, and establish its asymptotic optimality. For practical scenarios involving unknown interference direction, we further propose a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based detection method, jointly estimating interference direction via the Root-MUSIC algorithm. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve high detection accuracy with remarkably low latency, highlighting their practical applicability in future satellite-to-device communication systems.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation in STAR-RIS-Aided Multi-User Networks with Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate real-time interference mitigation in multiuser wireless networks assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). Unlike conventional methods that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we consider a practical scenario where only statistical CSI is available, and the STAR-RIS phase shifts are impaired by random phase errors modeled via the Von Mises distribution. To tackle the resulting nonconvex optimization problem induced by unit-modulus constraints and stochastic interference, we derive a closed-form approximation of the effective channel matrix using statistical expectations. We then reformulate the interference minimization problem as an unconstrained optimization over a Riemannian manifold and propose a conjugate gradient algorithm tailored to the complex circle manifold. The proposed solution enables efficient real-time computation of optimal phase shifts while accounting for hardware imperfections and limited CSI. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly suppresses inter-user interference and achieves superior SINR performance and convergence speed compared to conventional baselines.</description>

      <title>MORIC: CSI Delay-Doppler Decomposition for Robust Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7 GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition, particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy, enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Joint Spectrum Sensing and Resource Allocation for OFDMA-based Underwater Acoustic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications generally rely on cognitive radio (CR)-based ad-hoc networks due to challenges such as long propagation delay, limited channel resources, and high attenuation. To address the constraints of limited frequency resources, UWA communications have recently incorporated orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), significantly enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) through multiplexing gains. Still, {the} low propagation speed of UWA signals, combined with {the} dynamic underwater environment, creates asynchrony in multiple access scenarios. This causes inaccurate spectrum sensing as inter-carrier interference (ICI) increases, which leads to difficulties in resource allocation. As efficient resource allocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based CR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems. To resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource optimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based UWA-CR network. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that the proposed method is superior to baseline schemes, outperforming other methods by 42.9 % in SE and 4.4 % in communication success rate.</description>

Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a proof of concept of a fully-wireless two-node open-loop coherent distributed communication system and evaluate its performance by transmitting QPSK , 64-, and 256-QAM constellations at a symbol rate of 2 MBd over a 58 m link in an urban environment. The system is implemented in a distributed manner with on-node processing using software-defined radios (SDRs) and wireless internode communication to share coordination information and does not rely on external time or frequency references such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In each experiment ~100 messages were transmitted and a mean coherent gain of 0.936 was achieved across all measurements with a mean symbol error ratio of below $1.4\times 10^{-4}$ achieved up to 64-QAM, demonstrating a reliable bandwidth of up to 12 Mbps.</description>

      <title>DoA Estimation using MUSIC with Range/Doppler Multiplexing for MIMO-OFDM Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing emerges as a critical challenge in 6G networks, which require simultaneous communication and target sensing capabilities. State-of-the-art super-resolution techniques for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation encounter significant performance limitations when the number of targets exceeds antenna array dimensions. This paper introduces a novel sensing parameter estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. The proposed approach implements a strategic two-stage methodology: first, discriminating targets through delay and Doppler domain filtering to reduce the number of effective targets for super-resolution DoA estimation, and second, introducing a fusion technique to mitigate sidelobe interferences. The algorithm enables robust DoA estimation, particularly in high-density target environments with limited-size antenna arrays. Numerical simulations validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional DoA estimation approaches.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Communication Signals for Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion of passive and active measurements from sensor nodes becomes critical in localizing underwater objects and is traditionally achieved by communicating information to a central node. This causes significant inefficiencies in bandwidth, energy, and processing time, which are critical in marine applications. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the process of sensing, localization, and communication can be achieved jointly, and the inefficiencies can be minimized. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to analyse the efficacy of such communication signals in localizing a moving target in given underwater conditions. The Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is a performance metric used to determine the theoretical lower bound on localization errors. Simulation results illustrate the contours of localization error across various scenarios, offering valuable insights into system performance under different target dynamics and sea state conditions, showcasing their potential for efficient and reliable underwater localization applications.</description>

      <title>HELENA: High-Efficiency Learning-based channel Estimation using dual Neural Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for high-performance Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing systems such as 5G New Radio, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio and stringent latency constraints. This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) Meet Multiple Access: NOMA or OMA?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental two-user PASS-based communication system is considered under three MA schemes, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). For each MA scheme, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated to minimize the required transmit power for satisfying users' rate requirements. For NOMA and FDMA, a two-stage algorithm is proposed, where the locations of PAs are derived sequentially by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and fine-turning phase adjustment. For TDMA, by leveraging the time-switching feature of PASS, the optimal pinching beamforming of each time slot is derived to maximize the served user channel gain. Numerical results are provided to show that: 1) PASS can achieve a significant performance gain over conventional antenna systems, and 2) NOMA consistently outperforms FDMA, while TDMA provides superior performance than NOMA for symmetric user rate requirements.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Metasurface-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Unified Framework and Key Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.</description>

Abstract: We present the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Scattering Transform (MODWST), whose construction is inspired by the combination of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and the Scattering Wavelet Transform (WST). We also discuss the use of MODWST in classification tasks, evaluating its performance in two applications: stationary signal classification and ECG signal classification.

      <title>From Proxies to Fields: Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of Global Radiation from Sparse Sensor Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a &gt;58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.</description>

      <title>Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem of estimating a signal function from shifted, noisy observations. Our functional formulation reveals a new connection between MRA and deconvolution: the signal can be estimated from second-order statistics via Kotlarski's formula, an important identification result in deconvolution with replicated measurements. To design our MRA algorithms, we extend Kotlarski's formula to general dimension and study the estimation of signals with vanishing Fourier transform, thus also contributing to the deconvolution literature. We validate our deconvolution approach to MRA through both theory and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multi-Modal Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) powered by generative artificial intelligence enables highly efficient and reliable information transmission. However, it still necessitates the transmission of substantial amounts of data when dealing with complex scene information. In contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information. By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene.</description>

      <title>AI Flow: Perspectives, Scenarios, and Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Small-Scale State-Space Models for Edge AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture. To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization (PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability. Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations.</description>

      <title>SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations.</description>

      <title>Using Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM) to Model Hearing Loss and Cochlear Neural Degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trouble hearing in noisy situations remains a common complaint for both individuals with hearing loss and individuals with normal hearing. This is hypothesized to arise due to condition called: cochlear neural degeneration (CND) which can also result in significant variabilities in hearing aids outcomes. This paper uses computational models of auditory periphery to simulate various hearing tasks. We present an objective method to quantify hearing loss and CND by comparing auditory nerve fiber responses using a Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM). Specifically study 1, shows that NSIM can be used to map performance of individuals with hearing loss on phoneme recognition task with reasonable accuracy. In the study 2, we show that NSIM is a sensitive measure that can also be used to capture the deficits resulting from CND and can be a candidate for noninvasive biomarker of auditory synaptopathy.</description>

      <title>Spatially Consistent Air-to-Ground Channel Modeling with Probabilistic LOS/NLOS Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spatially consistent A2G channel model based on probabilistic LOS/NLOS segmentation to parameterize the deterministic path loss and stochastic shadow fading model. Motivated by the limitations of existing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) channel models that overlook spatial correlation, our approach reproduces LOS/NLOS transitions along ground user trajectories in urban environments. This model captures environment-specific obstructions by means of azimuth and elevation-dependent LOS probabilities without requiring a full detailed 3D representation of the surroundings. We validate our framework against a geometry-based simulator by evaluating it across various urban settings. The results demonstrate its accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling further realistic derivations of path loss and shadow fading models and thorough outage analysis.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Empowered by Large-Scale AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of low-altitude applications, there is an increasing demand for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) to simultaneously achieve high-rate communication, precise sensing, and reliable control in the low-altitude airspace. In this paper, we first present a typical system architecture of LAWNs, which integrates three core functionalities: communication, sensing, and control. Subsequently, we explore the promising prospects of movable antenna (MA)-assisted wireless communications, with emphasis on its potential in flexible beamforming, interference management, and spatial multiplexing gain. Furthermore, we elaborate on the integrated communication, sensing, and control capabilities enabled by MAs in LAWNs, and illustrate their effectiveness through representative examples. A case study demonstrates that MA-enabled LAWNs achieve significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-position antenna-based LAWNs in terms of communication throughput, sensing accuracy, and control stability. Finally, we outline several promising directions for future research, including the MA-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication/sensing, the MA-assisted reliable control, and the MA-enhanced physical layer security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SONIC, an embedded real-time noise suppression system implemented on the ARM Cortex-M7-based STM32H753ZI microcontroller. Using adaptive filtering (LMS), the system improves speech intelligibility in noisy environments. SONIC focuses on a novel approach to noise suppression in audio signals, specifically addressing the limitations of traditional Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) systems. The paper explores various signal processing algorithms in a micro-controller point of view, highlighting various performance factors and which were considered optimal in our embedded system. Additionally we also discussed the system architecture, explaining how the MCU's efficiency was harnessed, along with an in-depth overview of how the audio signals were translated within the processor. The results demonstrate improved speech clarity and practical real-time performance, showing low-power DSP as an alternative to complex AI denoising methods.</description>

      <title>A Contemporary Survey on Fluid Antenna Systems: Fundamentals and Networking Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in antenna design, offering enhanced spatial degrees of freedom through dynamic reconfigurability. By exploiting spatial flexibility, FAS can adapt to varying channel conditions and optimize wireless performance, making it a highly promising candidate for next-generation communication networks. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Recursive Fusion of Multiresolution Multispectral Images with Location-Aware Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiresolution image fusion is a key problem for real-time satellite imaging and plays a central role in detecting and monitoring natural phenomena such as floods. It aims to solve the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution in remote sensing instruments. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this problem, the presence of outliers such as clouds downgrades their performance. Moreover, strategies that integrate robustness, recursive operation and learned models are missing. In this paper, a robust recursive image fusion framework leveraging location-aware neural networks (NN) to model the image dynamics is proposed. Outliers are modeled by representing the probability of contamination of a given pixel and band. A NN model trained on a small dataset provides accurate predictions of the stochastic image time evolution, which improves both the accuracy and robustness of the method. A recursive solution is proposed to estimate the high-resolution images using a Bayesian variational inference framework. Experiments fusing images from the Landsat 8 and MODIS instruments show that the proposed approach is significantly more robust against cloud cover, without losing performance when no clouds are present.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV) is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness. However, since SSTV refers only to the local differences of pixels/bands, edges and textures that extend beyond adjacent pixels are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, which is designed to preserve two essential physical characteristics of HS images: semi-local spatial structures and spectral correlation across all bands. Specifically, we define S3TTV as the sum of the nuclear norms of spatio-spectral structure tensors, which are matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors within semi-local areas. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a constrained convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Hybrid MIMO Systems With Array Model Errors and Beam Squint Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a channel estimation method for hybrid wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems in high-frequency bands, including millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz), in the presence of beam squint effects and array errors arising from hardware impairments and environmental time fluctuations such as thermal effects and dynamic motion of the array. Although conventional channel estimation methods calibrate array errors through offline operation with large training pilots, the calibration errors remain due to time-varying array errors. Therefore, the proposed channel estimation method calibrates array errors online with small pilot overhead. In the proposed method, array response matrices are explicitly decomposed into a small number of physical parameters including path gains, angles and array errors, which are iteratively estimated by alternating optimization based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. To enhance the convergence performance, we introduce a switching mechanism from an ongrid algorithm to an off-gird algorithm depending on the estimation accuracy of the array error during algorithmic iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an approximate mutual coupling model to reduce the number of parameters. The reduction of parameters not only lowers computational complexity but also mitigates overfitting to noisy observations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively works online even with small pilot overhead in the presence of array errors.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic generalization of the Generalized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA. The GOSPA metric has been widely used to evaluate the distance between finite sets, particularly in multi-object estimation applications. The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA into the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization, missed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner. Examples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed P-GOSPA metric.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Precoder With Low-Resolution Phase Shifters and Fronthaul Capacity Limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In massive MIMO systems, fully digital precoding offers high performance but has significant implementation complexity and energy consumption, particularly at millimeter frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures provide a practical alternative by reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains while retaining performance in spatially sparse multipath scenarios. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. To minimize the sum rate degradation caused by quantized analog and digital precoders, we propose novel designs inspired by the sphere decoding (SD) algorithm. We demonstrate numerically that our proposed designs outperform traditional methods, ensuring minimal sum rate loss in hybrid precoding systems with low-resolution phase shifters and limited fronthaul capacity.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents an innovative energy harvesting (EH) and communication scheme for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by utilizing the emerging noise modulation (Noise-Mod) technique. Our proposed approach embeds information into the mean value of real Gaussian noise samples, enabling simultaneous power transfer and data transmission. We analyze our system under the Rician fading channels with path loss and derive the bit error probability (BEP) expression. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional modulation schemes in terms of energy harvesting capability across various channel conditions. This scheme offers a novel solution by directly embedding data into the noise-modulated signal to enable information decoding through mean-based detection. Furthermore, it increases energy harvesting capability thanks to the utilized Gaussian waveform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the data-aided channel estimation (CE) problem in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication system, where the channel and information symbols are estimated jointly during the CE phase, differently from pure pilot-aided methods. We propose a two-stage semi-blind receiver that jointly estimates the combined channel and the data symbols, followed by channel decoupling. To this end, we derive a new modeling framework whose first stage recasts the received signal to allow for the joint estimation of the combined channel and transmitted symbols. In the second stage, channel decoupling is easily achieved via Khatri-Rao factorization, yielding a refined channel estimate. Our solution yields accurate estimates of the cascaded channel at lower computational complexity. Simulation results reveal a similar performance of the proposed method to that of the competitor while providing a substantially reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate Classification in ECG Signals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.</description>

      <title>Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>

      <title>On the Degrees of Freedom and Eigenfunctions of Line-of-Sight Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a line-of-sight communication link between two holographic surfaces (HoloSs), and provide a closed-form expression for the effective degrees of freedom (eDoF), i.e., the number of orthogonal communication modes that can be established between them. The proposed framework can be applied to network deployments beyond the widely studied paraxial setting. This is obtained by partitioning the largest HoloS into sub-HoloSs, and proving that the supports of the Fourier transforms of the kernels of the obtained integral operators are limited and are almost disjoint in the wavenumber domain, provided that the sub-HoloSs are sufficiently small. Using the proposed approach, it is proved that (i) the eDoF correspond to an instance of Landau's second eigenvalue problem; (ii) the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to multiple values; and (iii) the eDoF depend explicitly on the approximation accuracy according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion. This result generalizes the analysis in the paraxial setting, in which it is known that the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to two values. In addition, it is proved that the typical method of analysis utilized in the paraxial setting, which is based on a parabolic approximation of the wavefront in a local coordinates system, is equivalent to a quartic approximation of the wavefront in a general coordinates system. This facilitates the derivation of an explicit formula for the eDoF in terms of key system parameters, including the relative offset between the center-points of the HoloSs, and their relative rotation and tilt. We specialize the framework to canonical network deployments, and provide analytical expressions for the optimal, according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion, basis functions (communication waveforms) for data encoding and decoding.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a key technology to support ultra-high data rates in future sixth-generation networks. However, the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) in such systems is challenging due to the passive nature of RIS and the hybrid beamforming architecture typically employed in THz systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel low-complexity two-phase channel estimation scheme for RIS-assisted THz systems with beam split effect. In the proposed scheme, we first estimate the full CSI over a small subset of subcarriers, then extract angular information at both the base station and RIS. Subsequently, we recover the full CSI across remaining subcarriers by determining the corresponding spatial directions and angle-excluded coefficients. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square error while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and operation at higher frequency bands in wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduce significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. Combined with dual-wideband impacts, these effects fundamentally reshape the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, making existing sparsity-based channel estimation methods inadequate. To address these challenges, this paper revisits the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems, considering dual-wideband effects, spherical wavefront, and SnS properties. By leveraging the spatial-chirp property of near-field array responses, we quantitatively characterize the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, revealing global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. Building on this structured sparsity, we formulate the wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference task and propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model to effectively capture the sparsity characteristics. To enable efficient channel reconstruction, we develop an MMV-based variational message passing (MMV-VMP) algorithm, tailored to the complex factor graph induced by the hierarchical prior. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its convergence and superior performance compared to existing methods, thus establishing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation under complex near-field conditions.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</description>
