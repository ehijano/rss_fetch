      <title>Inverse Radon transforms: analytical and Tikhonov-like regularizations of inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nexus between Thermodynamic Phase Transitions and Geometric Fractals through Systematic Lattice Point Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractals are ubiquitous in the natural world, and their connection with phase transitions has been widely observed. This study investigates mechanisms of fractal formation from the perspective of phase transitions. A novel set of probability calculation methods is introduced to establish a direct link between fractals and phase transitions. Notably, in the Ising model, a specific category of boundary lattice points undergoes a phase transition when the associated weight reaches approximately 0.4. The identified correlation between phase transitions and fractals suggests the emergence of fractal structures at this critical weight. The paper offers supporting evidence for this conclusion through the deliberate manipulation of the proposed probability-based method. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between fractals and phase transitions, providing valuable insights for further exploration in diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Gradient Estimation in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying turbulence, it is often desirable to be able to estimate the local spatial gradient of a vector quantity using in situ measurements from a small number of irregularly spaced points. While previous studies have focused on the accuracy of these methods as the number of measurement points varies, we focus on the accuracy of gradient estimations as a function of shape of the measurement point configuration. We find that for well-shaped configurations that are of correct relative size, we can very accurately estimate the local spatial gradient using only four points.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Synchronization-Induced Patterns in Two-dimensional Magnetic Rod Systems under Rotating Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two-dimensional assemblies of rod-shaped magnetic colloids under the influence of an external rotating magnetic field. Using Molecular Dynamics, we simulate the formation of patterns that emerge based on the synchronization degree between the magnetic rods and the rotating field. We then explore the structural and dynamic characteristics of the resulting steady states, examining their evolution as a function of changes in the rods' aspect ratio, the strength of the external magnetic field, and its rotation frequency. Three distinct synchronization regimes of the rods with the magnetic field are clearly observed. A detailed set of phase diagrams illustrates the complex relationship between the magnitude of the external magnetic field and its rotation frequency and how these parameters govern the formation of unique self-organized structures.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Investigation of Phase Transition Phenomena in Network Models Derived from Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice models exhibit significant potential in investigating phase transitions, yet they encounter numerous computational challenges. To address these issues, this study introduces a Monte Carlo-based approach that transforms lattice models into a network model with intricate inter-node correlations. This framework enables a profound analysis of Ising, JQ, and XY models. By decomposing the network into a maximum entropy and a conservative component, under the constraint of detailed balance, this work derive an estimation formula for the temperature-dependent magnetic induction in Ising models. Notably, the critical exponent $\beta$ in the Ising model aligns well with established results, and the predicted phase transition point in the three-dimensional Ising model exhibits a mere $0.7 \%$ deviation from numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A graph-space optimal transport FWI approach based on \kappa-generalized Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical basis for conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) approaches is commonly associated with Gaussian statistics. However, errors are rarely Gaussian in non-linear problems like FWI. In this work, we investigate the portability of a new objective function for FWI applications based on the graph-space optimal transport and $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian probability distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed objective function is robust in mitigating two critical problems in FWI, which are associated with cycle skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors. The results reveal that our proposal can mitigate the negative influence of cycle-skipping ambiguity and non-Gaussian noises and reduce the computational runtime for computing the transport plan associated with the optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.</description>

Abstract: HYPERTILING is a high-performance Python library for the generation and visualization of regular hyperbolic lattices embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model. Using highly optimized, efficient algorithms, hyperbolic tilings with millions of vertices can be created in a matter of minutes on a single workstation computer. Facilities including computation of adjacent vertices, dynamic lattice manipulation, refinements, as well as powerful plotting and animation capabilities are provided to support advanced uses of hyperbolic graphs. In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive exploration of the package, encompassing its mathematical foundations, usage examples, applications, and a detailed description of its implementation.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Topological interfacial states in ferroelectric domain walls of two-dimensional bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using machine learning methods, we explore different types of domain walls in the recently unveiled single-element ferroelectric, the bismuth monolayer [Nature 617, 67 (2023)]. Remarkably, our investigation reveals that the charged domain wall configuration exhibits lower energy compared to the uncharged domain wall structure. We also demonstrate that the experimentally discovered tail-to-tail domain wall maintains topological interfacial states caused by the change in the Z_2 number between ferroelectric and paraelectric states. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic built-in electric fields in asymmetry DW configurations, we find that the energy of topological interfacial states splits, resulting in an accidental band crossing at the Fermi level. Our study suggests that domain walls in two-dimensional bismuth hold potential as a promising platform for the development of ferroelectric domain wall devices.</description>

      <title>Energy states of Rydberg excitons in finite crystals: From weak to strong confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to quantum confinement, excitons in finite-sized crystals behave rather differently than in bulk materials. We investigate the dependence of energies of Rydberg excitons on the strengths of parabolic as well as rectangular confinement potentials in finite-sized crystals. The evolution of the energy levels of hydrogen-like excitons in the crossover region from weak to strong parabolic confinement is analyzed for different quantum numbers by numerical solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The energy spectrum of hydrogen-like excitons in Cu$_{2}$O-based rectangular quantum wells is, in turn, obtained numerically from the solution of the three-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a function of the quantum well width. Various crossings and avoided crossings of Rydberg energy levels are observed and categorized based on the symmetry properties of the exciton wave function. Particular attention is paid to the two limiting cases of narrow and wide quantum wells attributed to strong and weak confinement, respectively. The energies obtained with the pure Coulomb interaction are compared with the results originating from the Rytova-Keldysh potential, i.e., by taking into account the dielectric contrast in the quantum well and in the barrier.</description>

      <title>An unfitted high-order HDG method for two-fluid Stokes flow with exact NURBS geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-order, degree-adaptive hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is presented for two-fluid incompressible Stokes flows, with boundaries and interfaces described using NURBS. The NURBS curves are embedded in a fixed Cartesian grid, yielding an unfitted HDG scheme capable of treating the exact geometry of the boundaries/interfaces, circumventing the need for fitted, high-order, curved meshes. The framework of the NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM) is employed for accurate quadrature along immersed NURBS and in elements cut by NURBS curves. A Nitsche's formulation is used to enforce Dirichlet conditions on embedded surfaces, yielding unknowns only on the mesh skeleton as in standard HDG, without introducing any additional degree of freedom on non-matching boundaries/interfaces. The resulting unfitted HDG-NEFEM method combines non-conforming meshes, exact NURBS geometry and high-order approximations to provide high-fidelity results on coarse meshes, independent of the geometric features of the domain. Numerical examples illustrate the optimal accuracy and robustness of the method, even in the presence of badly cut cells or faces, and its suitability to simulate microfluidic systems from CAD geometries.</description>
