      <title>An information-based model selection criterion for data-driven model discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven model discovery (DDMD) algorithms are powerful tools for extracting interpretable symbolic models from data. However, identifying the model that best balances goodness-of-fit and sparsity is often a laborious process requiring user fine-tuning, is prone to overfitting, and results may significantly vary depending on model initialization and specific training procedure. Here, we present a sparse regression algorithm that automatically and adaptively generates candidate models, and uses a novel sample-length-scaling logarithmic information criterion (SLIC) to identify the best model from these candidates. We demonstrate that SLIC greatly outperforms other popular information criteria in extracting the correct model from the data of several nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. Then, we demonstrate SLIC's ability to discover interpretable models from experimental datasets in fluid dynamics and nanotechnology that generate new testable predictions.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Survival Modeling and Fairness-Aware Clinical Machine Learning for 5-Year Breast Cancer Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often underperform in real-world settings due to poor calibration, limited transportability, and subgroup disparities. These challenges are amplified in high-dimensional multimodal cancer datasets characterized by complex feature interactions and a p &gt;&gt; n structure. We present a fully reproducible multimodal machine learning framework for 5-year overall survival prediction in breast cancer, integrating clinical variables with high-dimensional transcriptomic and copy-number alteration (CNA) features from the METABRIC cohort.
  After variance- and sparsity-based filtering and dimensionality reduction, models were trained using stratified train/validation/test splits with validation-based hyperparameter tuning. Two survival approaches were compared: an elastic-net regularized Cox model (CoxNet) and a gradient-boosted survival tree model implemented using XGBoost. CoxNet provides embedded feature selection and stable estimation, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear effects and higher-order interactions.
  Performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP), calibration curves, Brier score, and bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals. CoxNet achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.3 and 96.6, with AP values of 90.1 and 80.4. XGBoost achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.6 and 92.5, with AP values of 92.5 and 79.9. Fairness diagnostics showed stable discrimination across age groups, estrogen receptor status, molecular subtypes, and menopausal state.
  This work introduces a governance-oriented multimodal survival framework emphasizing calibration, fairness auditing, robustness, and reproducibility for high-dimensional clinical machine learning.</description>

      <title>Prediction of source nutrients for microorganisms using metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metagenomics has lowered the barrier to microbial discovery--enabling the identification of novel microbes without isolation--but cultures remain imperative for the deep study of microbes. Cultivation and isolation of non-model microbes remains a major challenge, despite advances in high-throughput culturomic methods. The quantity of simultaneous experimental variables is constrained by time and resources, but the list can be reduced using computational biology. Given an annotated genome, metabolic modelling can be used to predict source nutrients required for the growth of a microbe, which acts as an initial screen to inform culture and isolation experiments. This chapter provides an overview of metabolic networks and modelling and how they can be used to predict the nutrient requirements of a microorganism, followed by a sample protocol using a toy metabolic network, which is then expanded to a genome-scale metabolic network application. These methods can be applied to any metabolic network of interest--which in turn can be created from any genome of interest--and are a starting point for experimental validation of source nutrients required for microorganisms that remain uncultivated to date.</description>

      <title>Multi-timescale synaptic plasticity on analog neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As numerical simulations grow in complexity, their demands on computing time and energy increase. Accelerators for numerical computation offer significant efficiency gains in many computationally-intensive scientific fields, but their use in simulating spiking neural networks in computational neuroscience is hindered by challenges, mainly in effective parallelism and efficient use of memory in the presence of sparse representations and sparse communication. The BrainScaleS architectures are neuromorphic substrates that can emulate spiking neural networks at accelerated timescales compared to real time, which offers an advantage for studying complex plasticity rules that require extended simulation runtimes. This work presents the implementation of a calcium-based plasticity rule that integrates calcium dynamics based on the synaptic tagging-and-capture hypothesis on the BrainScaleS-2 system. The implementation of the plasticity rule for a single synapse involves incorporating the calcium dynamics and the plasticity rule equations. The calcium dynamics are mapped to the analog circuits of BrainScaleS-2, while the plasticity rule equations are numerically solved on its embedded digital processors. The main hardware constraints include the speed of the processors and the use of integer arithmetic. By adjusting the timestep of the numerical solver and introducing stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that BrainScaleS-2 accurately emulates a single synapse following a calcium-based plasticity rule across four established stimulation protocols and validate our implementation against a software reference model.</description>
