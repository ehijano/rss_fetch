      <title>Risk-Aware GPU-Assisted Cardinality Estimation for Cost-Based Query Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a cornerstone of cost-based optimizers (CBOs), yet real-world workloads often violate the assumptions behind static statistics, degrading decision stability and increasing plan flip rates. We empirically characterize failures caused by stale statistics, skew, join correlations, hidden distributions in bind variables, and sampling bias, and quantify the overhead and break-even points of hardware-accelerated measurement.
  We propose GACE (GPU-Assisted Cardinality Estimation), a hybrid auxiliary architecture that augments rather than replaces the optimizer. GACE selectively invokes GPU-based measurement only in risky intervals via a Risky Gate that detects estimation uncertainty, and a GPU Measurement Engine that performs high-speed probing with explicit cost accounting for the measurement itself. This design preserves low overhead in stable regions while improving plan stability and reducing tail latency (P99) in problematic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automated Training of Learned Database Components with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of deep learning for database optimization has gained significant traction, offering improvements in indexing, cardinality estimation, and query optimization. However, acquiring high-quality training data remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the possibility of using generative models, such as GPT, to synthesize training data for learned database components. We present an initial feasibility study investigating their ability to produce realistic query distributions and execution plans for database workloads. Additionally, we discuss key challenges, such as data scalability and labeling, along with potential solutions. The initial results suggest that generative models can effectively augment training datasets, improving the adaptability of learned database techniques.</description>

      <title>Asia Cup 2025: A Structured T20 Match-Level Dataset and Exploratory Analysis for Cricket Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a structured and comprehensive dataset corresponding to the 2025 Asia Cup T20 cricket tournament, designed to facilitate data-driven research in sports analytics. The dataset comprises records from all 19 matches of the tournament and includes 61 variables covering team scores, wickets, powerplay statistics, boundary counts, toss decisions, venues, and player-specific highlights. To demonstrate its analytical value, we conduct an exploratory data analysis focusing on team performance indicators, boundary distributions, and scoring patterns. The dataset is publicly released through Zenodo under a CC-BY 4.0 license to support reproducibility and further research in cricket analytics, predictive modeling, and strategic decision-making. This work contributes an open, machine-readable benchmark dataset for advancing cricket analytics research.</description>
