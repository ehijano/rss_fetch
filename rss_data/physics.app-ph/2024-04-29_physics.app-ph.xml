      <title>Ultralow-Power Single-Sensor-Based E-Nose System Powered by Duty Cycling and Deep Learning for Real-Time Gas Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel, ultralow-power single-sensor-based electronic nose (e-nose) system for real-time gas identification, distinguishing itself from conventional sensor-array-based e-nose systems whose power consumption and cost increase with the number of sensors. Our system employs a single metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor built on a suspended 1D nanoheater, driven by duty cycling-characterized by repeated pulsed power inputs. The sensor's ultrafast thermal response, enabled by its small size, effectively decouples the effects of temperature and surface charge exchange on the MOS nanomaterial's conductivity. This provides distinct sensing signals that alternate between responses coupled with and decoupled from the thermally enhanced conductivity, all within a single time domain during duty cycling. The magnitude and ratio of these dual responses vary depending on the gas type and concentration, facilitating the early-stage gas identification of five gas types within 30 s via a convolutional neural network (classification accuracy = 93.9%, concentration regression error = 19.8%). Additionally, the duty-cycling mode significantly reduces power consumption by up to 90%, lowering it to 160 $\mu$W to heat the sensor to 250$^\circ$C. Manufactured using only wafer-level batch microfabrication processes, this innovative e-nose system promises the facile implementation of battery-driven, long-term, and cost-effective IoT monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Level attraction from interference in two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative couplings, respectively characterised by energy level repulsion and attraction, each have different applications for quantum information processing. Thus, a system in which both coherent and dissipative couplings are tunable on-demand and in-situ is tantalising. A first step towards this goal is the two-tone driving of two bosonic modes, whose experimental signature was shown to exhibit controllable level repulsion and attraction by changing the phase and amplitude of one drive. However, whether the underlying physics is that of coherent and dissipative couplings has not been clarified, and cannot be concluded solely from the measured resonances (or anti-resonances) of the system. Here, we show how the physics at play can be analysed theoretically. Combining this theory with realistic finite-element simulations, we deduce that the observation of level attraction originates from interferences due to the measurement setup, and not dissipative coupling. Beyond the clarification of a novel origin for level attraction attributed to interference, our work demonstrate how effective Hamiltonians can be derived to appropriately describe the physics.</description>

      <title>Bound state in the continuum and polarization-insensitive electric mirror in low-contrast metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-contrast refractive indexes are pivotal in dielectric metasurfaces for inducing various exotic phenomena, such as the bound state in the continuum (BIC) and electric mirror (EM). However, the limitations of high-index materials are adverse to the practical applications, thus low-contrast metasurfaces with comparable performance are highly desired. Here we present a low-contrast dielectric metasurface comprising radially anisotropic cylinders, which are SiO2 cylinders doped with a small amount of WS2. The cylinder exhibits unidirectional forward superscattering originating from the overlapping of the electric and magnetic dipole resonances. When normal illumination by a near-infrared plane wave, the metasurface consisting of the superscattering constituents manifests a polarization-insensitive EM. Conversely, when subjected to an in-plane incoming wave, the metasurface generates a symmetry-protected BIC characterized by an ultrahigh Q factor and nearly negligible out-of-plane energy radiation. Our work highlights the doping approach as an efficient strategy for designing low-contrast functional metasurfaces and sheds new light on the potential applications in photonic integrated circuits and on-chip optical communication.</description>

      <title>Power-dependent destabilization forces in trapping nanographene-based nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic optical tweezers have been used to trap nanoparticles and study interactions with their environment. An unavoidable challenge is the plasmonic heating due to resonant excitation and the resulting temperature rise in the surrounding environment. In this work, we demonstrate optical trapping of nanographene-based polymeric nanoparticles using metamaterial plasmonic tweezers. We achieved superior trapping performance and trap stiffness values as high as 8.8 (fN/nm)/(mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$) with optical intensities lower than 1 (mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$). A range of incident intensities was used to monitor the effect of increasing intensity in the trapping performance. Higher intensities resulted in stronger optical forces, but thermal effects tended to destabilize the trapping. Beyond a critical intensity, where the temperature rise reached 24$^o$C, a large number of particles were being trapped with lower stiffness values indicating the presence of thermal flows. We, therefore, identified a safe intensity regime to avoid detrimental thermal effects. Our platform is ideal for multiple particle trapping in an array configuration and could be used for stable nanopositioning of quantum emitters with controlled interactions with their environment, potentially useful in the field of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A manufacturable platform for photonic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst holding great promise for low noise, ease of operation and networking, useful photonic quantum computing has been precluded by the need for beyond-state-of-the-art components, manufactured by the millions. Here we introduce a manufacturable platform for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically-integrated silicon photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network, and detect photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with $99.98\% \pm 0.01\%$ state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference between independent photon sources with $99.50\%\pm0.25\%$ visibility, two-qubit fusion with $99.22\%\pm0.12\%$ fidelity, and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with $99.72\%\pm0.04\%$ fidelity, not accounting for loss. In addition, we preview a selection of next generation technologies, demonstrating low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components, fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters.</description>

      <title>Compact computer controlled biaxial tensile device for low-temperature transport measurements of layered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biaxial tensile device for transport study of layered materials is described. The device is mounted on the standard 24 pin zero force connector and can be moved between various setups. Compact design of the device makes it suitable for a wide range of studies. In our case, it is placed inside a 50 mm diameter chamber in closed-circle refrigerator and is used in the temperature range 9 K - 310 K. A sample is glued in the center of a polyimide cruciform substrate, the ends of which are connected to a tension system driven by four computer-controlled stepper motors providing tensile force up to 30 N. Computer simulation results and their experimental verification show that tensile strain along one axis depends on the tensile load along perpendicular direction, and this dependence turns out to be relatively strong and exceeds 40%. The operation of the device is demonstrated by studying the effect of deformation on the electrical conductivity of a layered compound 2H-NbS2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysteresis in organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) is a basic effect in which the measured current depends on the voltage sweep direction and velocity. This phenomenon has an important impact on different aspects of the application of OECT, such as the switching time and the synaptic properties for neuromorphic applications. Here we address the combined ionic and electronic kinetic effects that cause the dominant hysteresis effects. We use a combination of tools consisting on basic analytical models, advanced 2D drift-diffusion simulation, and the experimental measurement of a Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) OECT, working in an accumulation mode. We develop a general transmission line model considering drift electronic transport and ionic injection and diffusion from the electrolyte. We provide a basic classification of the transient response to a voltage pulse, according to the dominant ionic or electronic relaxation time, and the correspondent hysteresis effects of the transfer curves according to the general categories of inductive and capacitive hysteresis. These are basically related to the main control phenomenon, either the vertical diffusion of ions during doping and dedoping, or the equilibration of electronic current along the channel length.</description>

      <title>Frequency comb generation via synchronous pumped $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator on thin-film lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonator-based optical frequency comb generation is an enabling technology for a myriad of applications ranging from communications to precision spectroscopy. These frequency combs can be generated in nonlinear resonators driven using either continuous-wave (CW) light, which requires alignment of the pump frequency with the cavity resonance, or pulsed light, which also mandates that the pulse repetition rate and cavity free spectral range (FSR) are carefully matched. Advancements in nanophotonics have ignited interest in chip-scale optical frequency combs. However, realizing pulse-driven on-chip Kerr combs remains challenging, as microresonator cavities have limited tuning range in their FSR and resonance frequency. Here, we take steps to overcome this limitation and demonstrate broadband frequency comb generation using a $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator synchronously pumped by a tunable femtosecond pulse generator with on-chip amplitude and phase modulators. Notably, employing pulsed pumping overcomes limitations in Kerr comb generation typically seen in crystalline resonators from stimulated Raman scattering.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modelling of Critical Variables for Improving HVOF Coating using Gamma Regression Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal spray coating is a critical process in many industries, involving the application of coatings to surfaces to enhance their functionality. This paper proposes a framework for modelling and predicting critical target variables in thermal spray coating processes, based on the application of statistical design of experiments (DoE) and the modelling of the data using generalized linear models (GLMs) with a particular emphasis on gamma regression. Experimental data obtained from thermal spray coating trials are used to validate the presented approach, demonstrating that it is able to accurately model and predict critical target variables. As such, the framework has significant potential for the optimization of thermal spray coating processes, and can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective coating technologies in various industries.</description>

      <title>Wake Interference Effects on Flapping Dynamics of Elastic Inverted Foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using high-fidelity simulations, we study the self-induced flapping dynamics of an inverted elastic foil when it is placed in tandem with a stationary circular cylinder. The effect of wake interference on the inverted foil's coupled dynamics is examined at a fixed Reynolds number ($Re$) as a function of non-dimensional bending rigidity ($K_{B}$) and the structure to fluid mass ratio ($m^{*}$). Our results show that there exists a critical $K_{B, Cr} = 0.25$, above which the downstream foil is synchronized with the unsteady wake, and the cylinder controls the flapping response and the wake vortex dynamics. During synchronization, two additional flapping modes namely, small and moderate amplitude flapping mode are observed as a function of decreasing $K_{B}$. Below $K_{B, Cr}$, the downstream foil undergoes self-induced large-amplitude flapping (LAF) similar to an isolated foil counterpart. When the dynamics of the downstream foil are analyzed for a range of $m^{*}$, we can characterize the response dynamics into two regions, namely low and high sensitivity. The high sensitivity region is observed when the dynamics are controlled by the cylinder oscillations, i.e., for foils with high stiffness. In this regime, the foil dynamics negatively correlate to $K_{B}$ and $m^{*}$. The low sensitivity region is observed when the downstream foil is no longer synchronized with the wake and undergoes an LAF response, with dynamics that are weakly correlated to $K_{B}$. A new non-dimensional parameter is proposed that combines the effect of the foil's inertia and elastic forces and can capture the foil's response when it is subjected to wake interference effects. The findings from this study aim to generalize our understanding of the self-induced flapping dynamics of inverted foils in an array configuration and have relevance to the development of inverted foil-based renewable energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-free low-temperature silica for next generation integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advances in novel low-loss "on insulator" integrated photonics platforms beyond silicon, such as thin-film LiNbO3, LiTaO3, GaP and BaTiO3 have demonstrated major potential across a wide range of applications, due to their unique electro-optical or nonlinear optical properties. This has heralded novel devices, ranging from low-voltage and high-speed modulators to parametric amplifiers. For such photonic integrated circuits, a low-loss SiO2 cladding layer is a key element, serving as a passivation layer for the waveguides and enabling efficient fiber-to-chip coupling. However, numerous novel ferroelectric or III-V "on insulator" platforms have low tolerances for process temperature. This prohibits using high-temperature anneals to remove hydrogen, a common impurity that is inherent to ordinary chemical vapor deposited SiO2 and causes significant optical loss in the near infrared. Here, we satisfy the dichotomy of a low-loss wafer scale manufactured SiO2 cladding and low processing temperature. Inspired by the manufacturing of optical fibers, we introduce a hydrogen-free, low-loss SiO2 cladding that is deposited at low temperatures (300 degrees Celsius) by using SiCl4 and O2 as precursors in inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD). By replacing hydrogenous silicon precursors (e.g. SiH4) with SiCl4, the deposited film is inherently free from residual hydrogen. The process temperature is compatible with the "on insulator" platforms and CMOS electronic integrated circuits. We demonstrate a wide low-loss window that covers all telecommunication bands from 1260 nm to 1625 nm. We achieve a &lt; 2.5 dB/m waveguide loss at 1550 nm, comparable with 1200 degree Celsius annealed films. Our SiCl4 process provides a key future cladding for all recently emerged "on-insulator" photonics platforms, that is low cost, scalable in manufacturing, and directly foundry compatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has emerged as a subfield of spintronics, where an AFM N\'eel vector is used as a state variable. Efficient electric control and detection of the N\'eel vector are critical for spintronic applications. This review article features fundamental properties of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) as spintronic devices where such electric control and detection can be realized. We emphasize critical requirements for observing a large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in AFMTJs with collinear and noncollinear AFM electrodes, such as a momentum-dependent spin polarization and N\'eel spin currents. We further discuss spin torques in AFMTJs that are capable of N\'eel vector switching. Overall, AFMTJs have potential to become a new standard for spintronics providing larger magnetoresistive effects, few orders of magnitude faster switching speed, and much higher packing density than conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).</description>
