      <title>Engineering inter-band coupling in a two-band superconductor by topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06072v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Non-purely transverse Magnus force in superconducting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>An Exactly Solvable Model of Phase-Fluctuating Superconductivity in Cuprates: The Role of Partially Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly solvable Hubbard-like model that exhibits a pseudogap (PG) phase and a partially flat band, we perform self-consistent microscopic calculations of the superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, incorporating both thermal and zero-point superconducting phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The results reveal an important role of the partially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key features that are consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, we find a dome-shaped $d$-wave superconducting region in the temperature-doping phase diagram with the optimal doping point located near the quantum critical point between the PG and the metallic phases. Near the optimal doping, the partially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced destructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing, respectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC. While the phase fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC are relatively weak around optimal doping, they become significant in both underdoped and overdoped regimes. We then identify a discontinuity on the superconducting dome in underdoped regime that results from a transition from a strong- to a weak-phase-fluctuating state as doping approaches the optimal point.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate pumping of superconducting resonator parametric amplifier with evidence of phase-sensitive amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers are potentially important components for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments and utilitarian applications. We propose and realise an operation scheme that achieves amplification through the use of non-degenerate pumps, which addresses two key challenges in the design of parametric amplifiers: non-continuous gain across the band over which amplification is possible, and pump-tone removal. We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>

      <title>Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Something about the Mechanism of Induction: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.</description>
