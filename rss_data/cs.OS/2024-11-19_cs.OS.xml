      <title>Contextualizing Security and Privacy of Software-Defined Vehicles: State of the Art and Industry Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing reliance on software in vehicles has given rise to the concept of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs), fundamentally reshaping the vehicles and the automotive industry. This survey explores the cybersecurity and privacy challenges posed by SDVs, which increasingly integrate features like Over-the-Air (OTA) updates and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. While these advancements enhance vehicle capabilities and flexibility, they also come with a flip side: increased exposure to security risks including API vulnerabilities, third-party software risks, and supply-chain threats. The transition to SDVs also raises significant privacy concerns, with vehicles collecting vast amounts of sensitive data, such as location and driver behavior, that could be exploited using inference attacks. This work aims to provide a detailed overview of security threats, mitigation strategies, and privacy risks in SDVs, primarily through a literature review, enriched with insights from a targeted questionnaire with industry experts. Key topics include defining SDVs, comparing them to Connected Vehicles (CVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), discussing the security challenges associated with OTA updates and the impact of SDV features on data privacy. Our findings highlight the need for robust security frameworks, standardized communication protocols, and privacy-preserving techniques to address the issues of SDVs. This work ultimately emphasizes the importance of a multi-layered defense strategy,integrating both in-vehicle and cloud-based security solutions, to safeguard future SDVs and increase user trust.</description>
