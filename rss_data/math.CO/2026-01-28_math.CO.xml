      <title>Rigidity-Induced Scaling Laws in Unit Distance Graphs: The Algebraic Collapse of Dense Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Unit Distance Problem posed by Erd\H{o}s in 1946. While the upper bound of $O(n^{4/3})$ established by Spencer, Szemer'edi, and Trotter (1984) is tight for systems of pseudo-circles, it fails to account for the algebraic rigidity inherent to the Euclidean metric. By integrating structural rigidity decomposition with the theory of Cayley-Menger varieties, we demonstrate that unit distance graphs exceeding a critical density must contain rigid bipartite subgraphs. We prove a "Flatness Lemma," supported by symbolic computation of the elimination ideal, showing that the configuration variety of a unit-distance $K_{3,3}$ (and by extension $K_{4,4}$) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is algebraically singular and collapses to a lower-dimensional locus. This dimensional reduction precludes the existence of the amorphous, high-incidence structures required to sustain the $n^{4/3}$ scaling, effectively improving the upper bound for non-degenerate Euclidean configurations.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Almost Empty Monochromatic Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of counting almost empty monochromatic triangles in colored planar point sets, that is, triangles whose vertices are all assigned the same color and that contain only a few interior points. Specifically, we show that any $c$-coloring of a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position (that is, no three on a line) contains $\Omega(n^2)$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-1$ interior points and $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-2$ interior points, for any fixed $c \geq 2$. The latter, in particular, generalizes the result of Pach and T\'{o}th (2013) on the number of monochromatic empty triangles in 2-colored point sets, to the setting of multiple colors and monochromatic triangles with a few interior points. We also derive the limiting value of the expected number of triangles with $s$ interior points in random point sets, for any integer $s \geq 0$. As a result, we obtain the expected number of monochromatic triangles with at most $s$ interior points in random colorings of random point sets.</description>

      <title>Sedentary quantum walks on bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a quantum walk starting on a vertex tends to stay at home, then that vertex is said to be sedentary. We prove that almost all planar graphs and almost all trees contain at least two sedentary vertices for any assignment of edge weights -- a result that suggests vertex sedentariness is a common phenomenon in trees and planar graphs. For weighted bipartite graphs, we show that a vertex is not sedentary whenever 0 does not belong to its eigenvalue support. Consequently, each vertex in a nonsingular weighted bipartite graph is not sedentary, a stark contrast to weighted trees and weighted planar graphs. A corollary of this result is that every vertex in a bipartite graph with a unique perfect matching is not sedentary for any assignment of edge weights. We also construct new families of weighted bipartite graphs with sedentary vertices using the bipartite double and subdivision operations. Finally, we show that unweighted paths and unweighted even cycles contain no sedentary vertices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic number of edge-colored regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the asymptotic number of edge-colored regular graphs with a prescribed set of allowed vertex-incidence structures. The formula depends on specific critical points of a polynomial encoding the vertex-incidences. As an application, we compute the expected number of proper $c$-edge-colorings of a large random $k$-regular graph.</description>

      <title>The arc chromatic number for Galois projective planes, affine planes and Euclidean grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the minimum number of arcs required to partition the Galois projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$ is $q+1$. Furthermore, we determine the exact value for a fractional variant of this problem.
  We extend our analysis to affine planes $\text{AG}(2,q)$, proving that they can be partitioned into $q$ arcs. In particular, we show that this partition is tight when $q$ is an odd prime power, and that a $(q-1)$-partition is attainable for $q=2^k$ with $k \in \{1,2,3\}$. For $q=2^k$ with $k \geq 4$, we provide bounds between two possible values.
  Finally, we apply these results to Euclidean grids, demonstrating that a partition into $(1+\epsilon)n$ sets in general position exists for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $n$. We also present exact minimal partitions for small Euclidean grids.</description>

      <title>The linear Tur\'an number of the 3-graph $P_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any linear 3-graph on $n$ vertices without a path of length 5, the number of edges is at most $\frac{15}{11}n$, and the equality holds if and only if the graph is the disjoint union of $G_0$, a graph with 11 vertices and 15 edges. Thus, $ex_L(n,P_5)\leq \frac{15}{11}n$, and the equality holds if and only if $11|n$.</description>

      <title>Strengthening the balanced set condition for the distance-regular graph of the bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distance-regular graph $\Gamma=(X, \mathcal R)$ called the bilinear forms graph $H_q(D,N-D)$; we assume $N&gt;2D\geq 6$ and $q \not=2$. We show that $\Gamma$ satisfies the following strengthened version of the balanced set condition.
  For a vertex $x \in X$ and $0 \leq i \leq D$ define $\Gamma_i(x)=\lbrace y \in X\vert \partial(x,y)=i\rbrace$, where $\partial$ denotes the path-length distance function.
  Abbreviate $\Gamma(x)=\Gamma_1(x)$.
  Let $V={\mathbb R}^X$ denote the standard module for ${\rm Mat}_X(\mathbb R)$.
  For $x\in X$ let $\hat x \in V$ have $x$-coordinate 1 and all other coordinates 0.
  Let $E \in {\rm Mat}_X(\mathbb R)$ denote the primitive idempotent that corresponds to the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$.
  For a subset $\Omega \subseteq X$ define $\widehat \Omega = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \hat x$.
  We fix two vertices $x,y \in X$ and write $k=\partial(x,y)$. To avoid degenerate situations, we assume
  $2 \leq k \leq D-1$. Using $y$ we obtain an equitable partition $\lbrace O_i \rbrace_{i=1}^6$ of the local graph $\Gamma(x)$.
  By construction $O_1 = \Gamma (x) \cap \Gamma_{k-1}(y)$ and $O_6 = \Gamma(x) \cap \Gamma_{k+1}(y)$.
  We call $\lbrace O_i \rbrace_{i=1}^6$ the $y$-partition of $\Gamma(x)$. Let $\lbrace O'_i \rbrace_{i=1}^6$ denote the $x$-partition of $\Gamma(y)$.
  According to the original balanced set condition, for $i \in \lbrace 1,6\rbrace$ the vector $ E \widehat O_i - E \widehat O'_i$ is a scalar multiple of $E{\hat x}-E{\hat y}$. We show that for $1 \leq i \leq 6$ the vector $ E \widehat O_i - E \widehat O'_i$ is a scalar multiple of $E{\hat x}-E{\hat y}$. We investigate the consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>Excluding surfaces as minors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graph Minors Structure Theorem (GMST) of Robertson and Seymour states that for every graph $H,$ any $H$-minor-free graph $G$ has a tree-decomposition of bounded adhesion such that the torso of every bag embeds in a surface $\Sigma$ where $H$ does not embed after removing a small number of \textsl{apex vertices} and confining some vertices into a bounded number of \textsl{bounded depth} vortices. However, the functions involved in the original form of this statement were not explicit. In an enormous effort Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan proved a similar statement with explicit (and single-exponential in $|V(H)|$) bounds. However, their proof replaces the statement "a surface where $H$ does not embed'' with "a surface of Euler-genus in $\mathcal{O}(|H|^2)$''.
  In this paper we close this gap and prove that the bounds of Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan can be achieved with a tight bound on the Euler-genus. Moreover, we provide a more refined version of the GMST focussed exclusively on excluding, instead of a single graph, grid-like graphs that are minor-universal for a given set of surfaces. This allows us to give a description, in the style of Robertson and Seymour, of graphs excluding a graph of fixed Euler-genus as a minor, rather than focussing on the size of the graph.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Boppana's entropy inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent progress on the union-closed sets conjecture, a key lemma has been Boppana's entropy inequality: $h(x^2)\ge\phi xh(x)$, where $\phi=(1+\sqrt5)/2$ and $h(x)=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$. In this note, we prove that the generalized inequality $\alpha_kh(x^k)\ge x^{k-1}h(x)$, first conjectured by Yuster, holds for real $k&gt;1$, where $\alpha_k$ is the unique positive solution to $x(1+x)^{k-1}=1$. This implies an analogue of the union-closed sets conjecture for approximate $k$-union closed set systems. We also formalize our proof in Lean 4.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for Kruskal's Weak Tree Function tree(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit lower bound for Kruskal's weak tree function at n=3, proving that tree(3) &gt;= 844,424,930,131,960 = 3 * 2^48 - 8. This is achieved by constructing an explicit sequence of unlabeled rooted trees satisfying the constraints of the weak tree function and carefully analyzing the combinatorics of the "leg elimination" process. Our bound significantly exceeds previous estimates and demonstrates that even for small arguments, the weak tree function exhibits rapid growth.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of some identities on overpartitions with repeated smallest non-overlined part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k(n)$ denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest non-overlined part, say $s(\pi)$, appears $k$ times and every overlined part is bigger than $s(\pi)$. Let $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o(n)$ denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest non-overlined part appears $k$ times, every overlined part is bigger than $s(\pi)$ and all parts other than $s(\pi)$ are incongruent modulo $2$ with $s(\pi)$. Also, let $b_e(k,n)$ (resp., $b_o(k,n)$) denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ counted by $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o(n)$ where the number of parts greater than $s(\pi)$ is even (resp., odd), and let $$\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o'(n)=b_e(k,n)-b_o(k,n).$$ Recently, Malik and Sharma (arXiv:2601.15601v1) expressed the generating functions of these partition functions in terms of linear combinations of $q$-series with polynomials in $q$ as coefficients. As corollaries, they derived some partition identities involving the functions for $k=1$ and sought for combinatorial proofs of their results. In this paper, we present some desired proofs.</description>

      <title>A dual view of Roman Domination: The two neighbour packing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the two neighbour packing problem: For a graph \(G=(V,E)\) one seeks to find a maximum cardinality subset \(A \subseteq V\), such that, for all \(v\in V\), the closed neighbourhood of~\(v\) contains at most two vertices in~\(A\). This packing problem occurs naturally as the (integer) dual of the LP-relaxation of the Roman domination problem. As such, these two problems are weakly dual.
  We show that the two neighbour packing problem is NP-hard in general, but can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded tree-width, so on trees, in particular. We show that for trees, the two problems are strongly dual, letting us solve the Roman domination problem by computing an optimal solution to the two neighbour packing problem.</description>

      <title>General position and mutual-visibility in shadow graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{general position problem} in graphs asks for a largest set of vertices in which no three lie on a common shortest path. The \emph{mutual-visibility problem} seeks a largest set of vertices such that every pair is connected by a shortest path whose internal vertices lie outside the set. In this paper, we investigate the general position and mutual-visibility problems for shadow graphs. Sharp general bounds are established for both the general position number and the mutual-visibility number of shadow graphs, and classes of graphs attaining these extremal values are characterized. Furthermore, these invariants are determined for several standard classes of shadow graphs, including shadow graphs of cycles, multipartite graphs, and trees.</description>

      <title>Cost-Benefit Analysis for PMU Placement in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power domination is a graph-theoretic model for the observance of a power grid using phasor measurement units (PMUs). There are many costs associated with the installation of a PMU, but also costs associated with not observing the entire power grid. In this work, we propose and study a power domination cost function, which balances these two costs. Given a graph $G$, a set of sensor locations $S$, and a parameter $\beta$ (which is the ratio of the cost of a PMU to the cost of non-observance of any given vertex), we define the cost function
  \[ \mathrm{C}(G;S,\beta)=|S|+\beta\cdot (|V(G)|-|\mathrm{Obs}(G;S)|) \] where $|\mathrm{Obs}(G;S)|$ is the number of vertices observed by sensors placed at $S\subseteq V(G)$ in the power domination process. We explore the values of $k$ for which there is a set $S$ of size $k$ that minimizes this cost function, and explore which values of $\beta$ guarantee that it is optimal to observe the entire power grid to minimize cost. We also introduce notions of marginal cost and marginal observance, providing tools to analyze how many PMUs one should install on a given power grid.</description>

      <title>Containments of Tensor Network Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Buczy\'nska et al., we study here tensor formats and their corresponding encoding of tensors via two-fold tensor products determined by the combinatorics of a binary tree. The set of all tensors representable by a given network forms the corresponding tensor network variety. A very basic question asks whether every tensor representable by one network is representable by another network, namely, when one tensor network variety is contained in another. Specific instances of this question became known as the Hackbusch Conjecture. Here, we propose a general framework for this question and take first steps, theoretical as well as experimental, towards a better understanding. In particular, given any two binary trees on $n$ leaves, we define (and prove existence of) a new measure, the containment exponent, which gauges how much one has to boost the parameters of one network for the containment to hold. We present an algorithm for bounding these containment exponents of tensor network varieties and report on an exhaustive search among trees on up to $n=8$ leaves.</description>

      <title>Grassmann--Pl\"ucker functions for orthogonal matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new cryptomorphic definition of orthogonal matroids with coefficients using Grassmann--Pl\"ucker functions. The equivalence is motivated by Cayley's identities expressing principal and almost-principal minors of a skew-symmetric matrix in terms of its Pfaffians. As a corollary of the new cryptomorphism, we deduce that each component of the orthogonal Grassmannian is parameterized by certain part of the Pl\"ucker coordinates.</description>

      <title>Large point-line matchings and small Nikodym sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integer $d \geq 2$ and prime power $q$, we construct unexpectedly large induced matchings in the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ by leveraging a new connection with the Furstenberg-S\'ark\"ozy problem from arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$.
  These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov.
  We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.</description>

      <title>Double-Cover-Based Analysis of the Bethe Permanent of Block-Structured Positive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the permanent of a square matrix with non-negative entries. A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble. We use graph-cover-based approaches to explain the reasons for this behavior and to quantify the observed value.</description>

      <title>Geometry of in-in correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of polytopes -- in-in zonotopes -- whose boundary structure organizes the contributions to scalar equal-time correlators in flat space computed via the in-in formalism. We provide explicit Minkowski sum and facet descriptions of these polytopes, and show that their boundaries factorize into products of graphical zonotopes and lower-dimensional in-in zonotopes, thereby mimicking the factorization structure of the correlators themselves. Evaluating their canonical forms at the origin -- equivalently, calculating the volume of the dual polytope -- reproduces the correlator. Finally, in a simple example, we show that the wavefunction decomposition of the correlator corresponds to a subdivision of the dual polytope.</description>

We also construct a family of $(P_2)$-closed groups for which the smallest order of an edge inversion is an arbitrarily high finite number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a circle and square of the same area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are equidecomposable by translations using $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_2$ pieces. That is, pieces which are simultaneously $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ sets. This improves a result of M\'ath\'e-Noel-Pikhurko and is the best possible complexity in terms of the Borel hierarchy. More generally we show that bounded sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with small enough boundaries and the same nonzero Lebesgue measure are equidecomposable with pieces that are countable unions of finite Boolean combinations of translates of $A,B$, and open sets. The improvement comes from constructions of low complexity toasts and related objects which should be independently useful within Borel combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a recent question of Cs\'oka and Vidny\'anszky [arXiv:2407.10006] and give an alternate proof of one of their results. The subject of both is which finite graphs admit factor of i.i.d. homomorphisms from the 3-regular tree. We then give yet another proof of the result in the Borel setting which leads to the following: For each $d &gt; 2$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a Borel hyperfinite $d$-regular forest $G$ and a finite graph with chromatic number $k$, $H$, so that $G$ does not admit a Borel homomorphism to $H$. All of this is tied together by a focus on the case when the target graph $H$ is a (subgraph of a) Kneser graph.</description>

      <title>LCLs in the Borel Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) on a group $\Gamma$ asks one to find a labeling of the Cayley graph of $\Gamma$ satisfying a fixed, finite set of "local" constraints. Typical examples include proper coloring and perfect matching problems. In descriptive combinatorics, one often considers the existence of solutions to LCLs in the setting of descriptive set theory. For example, given a free action of $\Gamma$ on a Polish space $X$, we might be interested in solving a given LCL on each orbit in a continuous, Borel, measurable, etc. way.
  In an attempt to understand more finely the gap between Borel and continuous combinatorics, we consider the existence of Baire class $m$ solutions to LCLs. For all $n &gt; 1$ and $m \in \omega$, we produce an LCL on $\mathbb{F}_n$ which always admits Baire class $m+1$ solutions, but not necessarily Baire class $m$ solutions.</description>

      <title>Price of Locality in Permutation Mastermind: Are TikTok influencers Chaotic Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the permutation Mastermind game, the goal is to uncover a secret permutation $\sigma^\star \colon [n] \to [n]$ by making a series of guesses $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_T$ which must also be permutations of $[n]$, and receiving as feedback after guess $\pi_t$ the number of positions $i$ for which $\sigma^\star(i) = \pi_t(i)$. While the existing literature on permutation Mastermind suggests strategies in which $\pi_t$ and $\pi_{t+1}$ might be widely different permutations, a resurgence in popularity of this game as a TikTok trend shows that humans (or at least TikTok influencers) use strategies in which consecutive guesses are very similar. For example, it is common to see players attempt one transposition at a time and slowly see their score increase. Motivated by these observations, we study the theoretical impact of two forms of "locality" in permutation Mastermind strategies: $\ell_k$-local strategies, in which any two consecutive guesses differ in at most $k$ positions, and the even more restrictive class of $w_k$-local strategies, in which consecutive guesses differ in a window of length at most $k$. We show that, in broad terms, the optimal number of guesses for local strategies is quadratic, and thus much worse than the $O(n \lg n)$ guesses that suffice for non-local strategies. We also show NP-hardness of the satisfiability version for $\ell_3$-local strategies, whereas in the $\ell_2$-local variant the problem admits a randomized polynomial algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The product matrix of a finite commutative ring $R=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ and an element $u \in R$ is the matrix $A_u(R)=[a_{ij}]$, where $a_{ij}=1$ if $x_ix_j=u$, and $a_{ij}=0$ otherwise. This provides a natural extension of the concept of the adjacency matrix of the zero-divisor graph of a ring, which has been studied extensively. In this paper, we find the characteristic polynomial of $A_u(R)$ for a local ring $R$ of odd order and a unit $u$. By studying the structure of a finite local ring, we find the characteristic polynomial of $A_u(R)$ for a local ring $R$ and any $u \in R$ in two cases: when the Jacobson radical of $R$ has either the maximal or the minimal possible index of nilpotency.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the classical Jacobi theta function $\vartheta$ is the exponential generating function of the Eisenstein series, we study the exponential Taylor coefficients (in the elliptic variable) of a related natural partial theta function, as well as a false theta function related to the Dedekind eta function. We prove that the space spanned by these objects is closed under differentiation, analogous to the space of quasimodular forms, and that it contains the quasimodular forms themselves. We further provide their Fourier expansions, establish quasimodular completions, and derive a recursive formula for the Taylor coefficients of the logarithm of the unimodal rank generating function, expressed as partition traces of the false and partial objects.</description>

Abstract: For a permutation $z$ in the symmetric group $\mathrm{S}_{n}$, denote by $L_{z}$ the corresponding simple highest weight module in the principal block of the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial answer to Kostant's problem for the modules $L_{z}$ when $z$ has shape (associated Young diagram/integer partition via Robinson-Schensted correspondence) equal to $(n-2,1,1)$ or $(n-3,2,1)$. Moreover, we verify that certain closely related conjectures hold for such permutations, including the Indecomposability Conjecture, which states that applying any indecomposable projective functor to the corresponding simple highest weight module outputs either an indecomposable module or zero.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetric Normaliser Graph of a Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the symmetric normaliser graph of a group $G$. The vertex set of this graph consists of elements of the group. Vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $x$ lies in the normaliser of $\langle y \rangle$ and $y$ lies in the normaliser of $\langle x \rangle$. We investigate the hierarchical position this graph occupies in the hierarchy of graphs defined on groups. We show that the existing hierarchy is further refined by this graph and that the edges of this graph lie between the edges of the commuting graph and the nilpotent graph. For finite groups, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the symmetric normaliser graph to be equal to the commuting graph and similarly, for equality with the nilpotent graph. The edge set of the symmetric normaliser graph is also a subset of the edge set of the Engel graph of a group and has connections to the non-generating graph of a group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a monoid (written multiplicatively). Equipped with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $M$ on its parts, the collection of all finite subsets of $M$ containing the identity element is itself a monoid, denoted by $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin}, 1}(M)$ and called the reduced finitary power monoid of $M$.
  One is naturally led to ask whether, for all $H$ and $K$ in a given class of monoids, $\mathcal P_{\fin,1}(H)$ and $\mathcal P_{\fin,1}(K)$ are isomorphic if and only if $H$ and $K$ are. The problem originates from a conjecture of Bienvenu and Geroldinger [Israel J. Math., 2025] that was recently settled by the authors [Proc. AMS, 2025]. Here, we provide a positive answer to the problem in the case where $H$ and $K$ are cancellative monoids, one of which is torsion. In particular, the answer is in the affirmative when $H$ and $K$ are torsion groups. Whether the conclusion extends to arbitrary groups remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the tail of the sets $$\mathbf S_x := \big\{\left\lfloor x^n\right\rfloor : n\in \mathbb N\big\}$$ are Sidon for almost all $x\in (1,2)$. Then we prove that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $x\in (1,\, 1+\varepsilon)$ and $r\in (2-\varepsilon,\, 2)$ such that $\mathbf S_x$ and $\mathbf S_r$ have a Sidon tail.</description>

      <title>Symmetric polynomials: DIM integrable systems versus twisted Cherednik systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss interrelations between eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians associated with the commutative (integer ray) subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra and those of the twisted Cherednik system. In the case of $t=q^{-m}$ with natural $m$, eigenfunctions of the first system of Hamiltonians are the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAFs) introduced by O. Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly.</description>

      <title>Completely Additive Height Functions: Profile Laws, Matula Bounds, and Inverse Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The height $H(n)$ of $n$ is the least integer $i$ such that the $i$-th iterate of Euler's totient function $\varphi^{(i)}(n)$ equals $1$. H. N. Shapiro showed that this $H$ is almost completely additive. Building on the fact that this function can be modified to yield a completely additive function, we establish a general correspondence: to every multi-partition structure there corresponds a completely additive function. In this paper, a \emph{height function} is a completely additive map $H:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ with $H(1)=0$ whose prime fibres $\{p:\,H(p)=k\}$ are finite for every $k\ge1$. Writing \[ \pi_k=\#\{p:\,H(p)=k\},\qquad N_k=\#\{n:\,H(n)=k\}, \] complete additivity forces the identity \[ \sum_{k\ge0}N_k q^k \;=\; \prod_{j\ge1}(1-q^j)^{-\pi_j}. \] Thus, the prime--height profile $(\pi_k)$ canonically determines the height multiplicities $(N_k)$, linking to the asymptotic theory of weighted partitions. We introduce a broad class of iteratively defined heights on primes, encompassing Matula-type heights (encoding rooted trees) and Shapiro-type totient heights, and show they extend to genuine height functions. In the Matula case this yields a purely number-theoretic proof of the classical extremal bounds for minimal and maximal Matula numbers, answering a question of Gutman and Ivi\'c without recourse to graph theory. Using Meinardus' theorem we prove an \emph{inverse-growth} principle in the polynomial regime: if $\Pi(x)=\sum_{j\le x}\pi_j \sim (C/\alpha)x^\alpha$, then $\log N_k$ satisfies a stretched-exponential law with an explicit constant, and conversely under a standard Tauberian hypothesis. We further derive average-order consequences in this regime for a canonical sequential realization of a given profile. Finally, we briefly discuss behavior beyond the polynomial setting, with computations in the Shapiro case suggesting substantially richer phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fast winning strategies in a generalized van der Waerden game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following Maker-Breaker game. Fix a finite subset $S\subset\mathbb{N}$ of the naturals. The players Maker and Breaker take turns choosing previously unclaimed natural numbers. Maker wins by eventually building a homothetic copy $aS+b$ of $S$, where $a\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}$ and $b\in\mathbb{Z}$. This is a generalization of the van der Waerden game analyzed by Beck. By the Hales-Jewett theorem, there exists a constant $c$ depending only on $|S|$ such that Maker can win in $c$ or less moves. We show that Maker can win in $|S|$ moves if $|S|\leq 3$. When $|S|=4$, we show that Maker can always win in $5$ or less moves and describe all $S$ such that Maker can win in $4$ moves. If $|S|\geq 5$, Maker has no winning strategy in $|S|$ moves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unified method to study the adjacency matrices of regular graphs (including infinite ones) using holomorphic functional calculus. By applying this calculus on a specific ellipse that contains the spectrum, we derive an expansion of $h(A)$ using non-backtracking matrices. This framework allows us to systematically obtain discrete trace formulas that link spectral theory with graph combinatorics. To show how this method works, we give new proofs for several well-known problems, such as walk counting, the Ihara-Bass formula, and solutions to the heat and Schr\"odinger equations on graphs.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable subgraphs in digraphs with large out-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask the question, which oriented trees $T$ must be contained as subgraphs in every finite directed graph of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. We formulate the following simple condition: all vertices in $T$ of in-degree at least $2$ must be on the same 'level' in the natural height function of $T$. We prove this condition to be necessary and conjecture it to be sufficient. In support of our conjecture, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees.
  An essential tool in the latter proof, and a question interesting in its own right, is finding large subdivided in-stars in a directed graph of large minimum out-degree. We conjecture that any digraph and oriented graph of minimum out-degree at least $k\ell$ and $k\ell/2$, respectively, contains the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves as a subgraph; this would be tight and generalizes a conjecture of Thomass\'e. We prove this for digraphs and $k=2$ up to a factor of less than $2$.</description>

      <title>Identically vanishing $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recurrence for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials is usually iterated upwards to positive values of $n$ only. When the recurrence is iterated downwards to $n&lt;0$, there are indices where the polynomials vanish identically. This fact does not seem to have been noted in the literature. We derive the set of such indices. We present the left-justified generalized Pascal triangle for $n&lt;0$. For $k\ge3$ and $n&lt;0$, we show that the degree of the polynomial does not increase monotonically with $|n|$. We derive expressions for the individual polynomial coefficients (the elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots). We present results for the properties of the polynomials, for both $n&gt;0$ and $n&lt;0$, including factorization of the polynomials and properties of the roots (including bounds on the amplitudes of the nonzero roots). Results are also derived for real roots. (Separate treatments are required for $n&gt;0$ and $n&lt;0$.) We employ generating functions to derive new combinatorial sums for the polynomials. The sums are more concise and computationally more efficient than previously published expressions. We also exhibit the relation of the $k$-generalized Jacobsthal and Pell polynomials to the Fibonacci polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Shannon Capacity of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact values and new bounds for the Shannon capacity of two families of graphs: the $q$-Kneser graphs and the tadpole graphs. We also construct a countably infinite family of connected graphs whose Shannon capacity is not attained by the independence number of any finite strong power. Building on recent work of Schrijver, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Shannon capacity of a polynomial in graphs, formed via disjoint unions and strong products, equals the corresponding polynomial of the individual capacities, thereby reducing the evaluation of such capacities to that of their components. Finally, we prove an inequality relating the Shannon capacities of the strong product of graphs and their disjoint union, which yields alternative proofs of several known bounds as well as new tightness conditions. In addition to contributing to the computation of the Shannon capacity of graphs, this paper is intended to serve as an accessible entry point to those wishing to work in this area.</description>

      <title>On the number of linear uniform hypergraphs with linear girth constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $r\geqslant 3$, a hypergraph on vertex set $[n]$ is $r$-uniform if each edge is a set of $r$ vertices, and is said to be linear if every two distinct edges share at most one vertex. Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs,let $Forb_r^L(n,\mathcal{H})$ be the set of linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs on vertex set $[n]$, which does not contain any member from $\mathcal{H}$ as a subgraph. An $r$-uniform linear cycle of length $\ell$, denoted by $C_\ell^r$, is a linear $r$-uniform hypergraph on $(r-1)\ell$ vertices whose edges can be ordered as $\boldsymbol{e}_1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{e}_\ell$ such that $|\boldsymbol{e}_i\cap \boldsymbol{e}_j|=1$ if $j=i\pm 1$ (indices taken modulo $\ell$) and $|\boldsymbol{e}_i\cap \boldsymbol{e}_j|=0$ otherwise. The linear girth of a linear $r$-uniform hypergraph is the smallest integer $\ell$ such that it contains a $C_\ell^r$. Let $Forb_L(n,r,\ell)=Forb_r^L(n,\mathcal{H})$ when $\mathcal{H}=\{C_i^r:\, 3\leqslant i\leqslant \ell\}$, that is, $Forb_L(n,r,\ell)$ is the set of all linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $[n]$ with linear girth greater than $\ell$. For integers $r\geqslant 3$ and $\ell\geqslant 4$, Balogh and Li [On the number of linear hypergraphs of large girth, J. Graph Theory, 93(1) (2020), 113-141] showed that $|Forb_L(n,r,\ell)|= 2^{O(n^{1+1/\lfloor \ell/2\rfloor})}$ based on the graph container method. It is natural to obtain $|Forb_L(n,r,\ell)|\geqslant 2^{c\cdot n^{1+1/\ell}}$ for some constant $c$ by probabilistic deletion method. Combined with the known results that $|Forb_L(n,r,3)|= 2^{o (n^{2})}$ and $|Forb_L(n,3,4)|= 2^{\Theta (n^{3/2})}$, by analyzing the random greedy high linear girth linear $r$-uniform hypergraph process, we show $|Forb_L(n,r,\ell)|\geqslant 2^{n^{1+1/(\ell-1)-O(\log\log n/\log n)}}$ for every pair of fixed integers $r,\ell\geqslant 4$, or $r= 3$ and $\ell\geqslant 5$.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets I: an Elementary Bound for Directed Cycle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1996, Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [Combinatorica 1996] proved Younger's Conjecture, which states that, for all directed graphs $D$, there exists a function $f$ such that, if $D$ does not contain $k$ disjoint cycles, then $D$ contains a feedback vertex set, i.e.~a subset of vertices whose deletion renders the graph acyclic, of size bounded by $f(k)$. However, the function obtained by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in their paper is enormous and, in fact, not even elementary. We prove the first elementary upper bound for the function $f$ above, showing it is upper-bounded by a power tower of height 8.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016], who proved a polynomial bound for the Excluded Grid Theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing \emph{paths of well-linked sets (PWS)}, and show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large PWS, which in turn contains a large fence.
  We believe that the theoretical tools developed in this work may find applications beyond the results above, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016] did for undirected graphs (see, for example, Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge [Discret.~Math.~Theor.~Comput.~Sci.~2022], Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA 2015] and Chuzhoy and Nimavat [arXiv 2019]). Indeed, in a follow-up paper, we apply this framework to improve the bounds of the Directed Grid Theorem.</description>

      <title>Derangements in intransitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. (Feldman also implicitly raised this conjecture on StackExchange.) We also prove the conjecture for soluble groups, almost simple groups and groups of order at most 50000, and we reduce the conjecture to perfect groups. Along the way, we prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order, and we highlight connections with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and some applications in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets based on Diophantine approximation in the Euclidean space, and consider their applications in several problems in harmonic analysis.
  Our first application is on the Hausdorff dimension of our sets. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang on the ABC sum-product problem is sharp. Higher dimensional cases and the relation to orthogonal projections are also discussed. Some conjectures are proposed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. For every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$, we are able to construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that has Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions, i.e.,
  $$\mu(B(x,r))\lesssim_\epsilon r^{s-\epsilon}
  \ \text{and} \ |\hat{\mu}(\xi)|\lesssim_\epsilon |\xi|^{-t/2 +\epsilon}, \ \forall\,\epsilon&gt;0.$$
  It is fundamental but the very first such result in the literature.
  Our last result is to provide a viewpoint of the sharpness of Fourier restriction over general measures from dimensions of sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Ideal transition systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inductive method of computing initial ideals and Gr\"obner bases for families of ideals in a polynomial ring. This method starts from a given set of pairs $(I,J)$ where $I$ is any ideal and $J$ is a monomial ideal contained in the initial ideal of $I$. These containments become a system of equalities if one can establish a particular transition recurrence among the chosen ideals. We describe explicit constructions of such systems in two motivating cases -- namely, for the ideals of matrix Schubert varieties and their skew-symmetric analogues. Despite many formal similarities with these examples, for the symmetric versions of matrix Schubert varieties, it is an open problem to construct the same kind of transition system. We present several conjectures that would follow from such a construction, while also discussing the special obstructions arising in the symmetric case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the lonely runner conjecture holds for nine runners. Our proof is based on a couple of improvements of the method we used to prove the conjecture for eight runners.</description>
