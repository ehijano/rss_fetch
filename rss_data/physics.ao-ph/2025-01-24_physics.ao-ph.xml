      <title>High-intensity wave vortices around subwavelength holes: from ocean tides to nanooptics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortices are ubiquitous in nature; they appear in a variety of phenomena ranging from galaxy formation in astrophysics to topological defects in quantum fluids. In particular, wave vortices have attracted enormous attention and found applications in optics, acoustics, electron microscopy, etc. Such vortices carry quantized phase singularities accompanied by zero intensity in the center, and quantum-like orbital angular momentum, with the minimum localization scale of the wavelength. Here we describe a conceptually novel type of wave vortices, which can appear around arbitrarily small `holes' (i.e., excluded areas or defects) in a homogeneous 2D plane. Such vortices are characterized by high intensity and confinement at the edges of the hole and hence subwavelength localization of the angular momentum. We demonstrate the appearance of such vortices in: (i) optical near fields around metallic nanodiscs on a dielectric substrate, (ii) phonon-polariton fields around nanoholes in a polaritonic slab, and (iii) ocean tidal waves around islands of New Zealand and Madagascar. We also propose a simple toy model of the generation of such subwavelength vortices via the interference of a point-dipole source and a plane wave, where the vortex sign is controlled by the mutual phase between these waves. Our findings open avenues for subwavelength vortex/angular-momentum-based applications in various wave fields.</description>

      <title>Validating Deep Learning Weather Forecast Models on Recent High-Impact Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forecast accuracy of machine learning (ML) weather prediction models is improving rapidly, leading many to speak of a "second revolution in weather forecasting". With numerous methods being developed and limited physical guarantees offered by ML models, there is a critical need for a comprehensive evaluation of these emerging techniques. While this need has been partly fulfilled by benchmark datasets, they provide little information on rare and impactful extreme events or on compound impact metrics, for which model accuracy might degrade due to misrepresented dependencies between variables. To address these issues, we compare ML weather prediction models (GraphCast, PanguWeather, and FourCastNet) and ECMWF's high-resolution forecast system (HRES) in three case studies: the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the 2023 South Asian humid heatwave, and the North American winter storm in 2021. We find that ML weather prediction models locally achieve similar accuracy to HRES on the record-shattering Pacific Northwest heatwave but underperform when aggregated over space and time. However, they forecast the compound winter storm substantially better. We also highlight structural differences in how the errors of HRES and the ML models build up to that event. The ML forecasts lack important variables for a detailed assessment of the health risks of the 2023 humid heatwave. Using a possible substitute variable, prediction errors show spatial patterns with the highest danger levels over Bangladesh being underestimated by the ML models. Generally, case-study-driven, impact-centric evaluation can complement existing research, increase public trust, and aid in developing reliable ML weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Quantifying risk of a noise-induced AMOC collapse from northern and tropical Atlantic Ocean variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exerts a major influence on global climate. There is much debate about whether the current strong AMOC may collapse as a result of anthropogenic forcing and/or internal variability. Increasing the noise in simple salt-advection models can change the apparent AMOC tipping threshold. However, it's not clear if 'present-day' variability is strong enough to induce a collapse. Here, we investigate how internal variability affects the likelihood of AMOC collapse. We examine internal variability of basin-scale salinities and temperatures in four CMIP6 pre-industrial simulations. We fit this to an empirical, process-based AMOC box model, and find that noise-induced AMOC collapse (defined as a decade in which the mean AMOC strength falls below 5 Sv) is unlikely for pre-industrial CMIP6 variability unless external forcing shifts the AMOC closer to a threshold. However, CMIP6 models seem to underestimate present-day Atlantic Ocean variability, and stronger variability substantially increases the likelihood of noise-induced collapse, especially if forcing brings the AMOC close to a stability threshold. Surprisingly, we find a case where forcing temporarily overshoots a stability threshold but noise decreases the probability of collapse. Accurately modelling internal decadal variability is essential for understanding the increased uncertainty in AMOC projections.</description>

      <title>Data-driven upper bounds and event attribution for unprecedented heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous record-shattering heatwaves in all corners of the globe. In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest in identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot temperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a data-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be exceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for heatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of observed events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called "impossible" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many unprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only when using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear connections between anthropogenic forcing and the "impossibility" of the most extreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides critical information about future record-breaking events and how their extremity relates to historical measurements.</description>
