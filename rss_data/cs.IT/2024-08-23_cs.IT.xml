      <title>Higher-order Interpretations of Deepcode, a Learned Feedback Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interpretation of Deepcode, a learned feedback code that showcases higher-order error correction relative to an earlier interpretable model. By interpretation, we mean succinct analytical encoder and decoder expressions (albeit with learned parameters) in which the role of feedback in achieving error correction is easy to understand. By higher-order, we mean that longer sequences of large noise values are acted upon by the encoder (which has access to these through the feedback) and used in error correction at the decoder in a two-stage decoding process.</description>

      <title>Modular Hypernetworks for Scalable and Adaptive Deep MIMO Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) were shown to facilitate the operation of uplink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers, with emerging architectures augmenting modules of classic receiver processing. Current designs consider static DNNs, whose architecture is fixed and weights are pre-trained. This induces a notable challenge, as the resulting MIMO receiver is suitable for a given configuration, i.e., channel distribution and number of users, while in practice these parameters change frequently with network variations and users leaving and joining the network. In this work, we tackle this core challenge of DNN-aided MIMO receivers. We build upon the concept of hypernetworks, augmenting the receiver with a pre-trained deep model whose purpose is to update the weights of the DNN-aided receiver upon instantaneous channel variations. We design our hypernetwork to augment modular deep receivers, leveraging their modularity to have the hypernetwork adapt not only the weights, but also the architecture. Our modular hypernetwork leads to a DNN-aided receiver whose architecture and resulting complexity adapts to the number of users, in addition to channel variations, without retraining. Our numerical studies demonstrate superior error-rate performance of modular hypernetworks in time-varying channels compared to static pre-trained receivers, while providing rapid adaptivity and scalability to network variations.</description>

      <title>Research on the Construction of Maximum Distance Separable Codes via Arbitrary twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes have significant combinatorial and cryptographic applications due to their certain optimality. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes may not necessarily be MDS. It is meaningful to study the conditions under which TGRS codes are MDS. In this paper, we study a general class of TGRS (A-TGRS) codes which include all the known special ones. First, we obtain a new explicit expression of the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix. Based on this, we further derive an equivalent condition under which an A-TGRS code is MDS. According to this, the A-TGRS MDS codes include nearly all the known related results in the previous literatures. More importantly, we also obtain many other classes of MDS TGRS codes with new parameter matrices. In addition, we present a new method to compute the inverse of the lower triangular Toplitz matrix by a linear feedback shift register, which will be very useful in many research fields.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Block-Controlled RIS: Bridging the Performance Gap to Element-Controlled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) requires numerous elements to achieve adequate array gain, which linearly increases power consumption (PC) with the number of reflection phases. To address this, this letter introduces a rotatable block-controlled RIS (BC-RIS) that preserves spectral efficiency (SE) while reducing power costs. Unlike the element-controlled RIS (EC-RIS), which necessitates independent phase control for each element, the BC-RIS uses a single phase control circuit for each block, substantially lowering power requirements. In the maximum ratio transmission, by customizing specular reflection channels through the rotation of blocks and coherently superimposing signals with optimized reflection phase of blocks, the BC-RIS achieves the same averaged SE as the EC-RIS. To counteract the added power demands from rotation, influenced by block size, we have developed a segmentation scheme to minimize overall PC. Furthermore, constraints for rotation power-related parameters have been established to enhance the energy efficiency of the BC-RIS compared to the EC-RIS. Numerical results confirm that this approach significantly improves energy efficiency while maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Channel Prediction in Wideband Massive MIMO Systems with Small Overhead for Online Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel prediction compensates for outdated channel state information in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been implemented to design channel predictors by leveraging the temporal correlation of wireless channels. However, most ML-based channel prediction techniques have only considered offline training when generating channel predictors, which can result in poor performance when encountering channel environments different from the ones they were trained on. To ensure prediction performance in varying channel conditions, we propose an online re-training framework that trains the channel predictor from scratch to effectively capture and respond to changes in the wireless environment. The training time includes data collection time and neural network training time, and should be minimized for practical channel predictors. To reduce the training time, especially data collection time, we propose a novel ML-based channel prediction technique called aggregated learning (AL) approach for wideband massive MIMO systems. In the proposed AL approach, the training data can be split and aggregated either in an array domain or frequency domain, which are the channel domains of MIMO-OFDM systems. This processing can significantly reduce the time for data collection. Our numerical results show that the AL approach even improves channel prediction performance in various scenarios with small training time overhead.</description>

      <title>Empowering Over-the-Air Personalized Federated Learning via RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) integrates analog communication with task-oriented computation, serving as a key enabling technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. However, AirComp-enabled FL (AirFL) with a single global consensus model fails to address the data heterogeneity in real-life FL scenarios with non-independent and identically distributed local datasets. In this paper, we introduce reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to enable efficient personalized AirFL, mitigating the data heterogeneity issue. First, we achieve statistical interference elimination across different clusters in the personalized AirFL framework via RIS phase shift configuration. Then, we propose two personalized aggregation schemes involving power control and denoising factor design from the perspectives of first- and second-order moments, respectively, to enhance the FL convergence. Numerical results validate the superior performance of our proposed schemes over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Fast Iterative ELAA-MIMO Detection Exploiting Static Channel Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture array (ELAA) is a promising multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique for next generation mobile networks. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to accelerate the convergence of current iterative MIMO detectors in ELAA channels. Our approaches exploit the static components of the ELAA channel, which include line of sight (LoS) paths and deterministic non-LoS (NLoS) components due to channel hardening effects. This paper proposes novel convergence acceleration techniques for fast iterative ELAA-MIMO detection by leveraging the static channel component, including the LoS paths and deterministic NLoS components that arise due to channel hardening. Specifically, these static channel components are utilized in two ways: as preconditioning matrices for general iterative algorithms, and as initialization for quasi-Newton (QN) methods. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches converge significantly faster compared to current iterative MIMO detectors, especially under strong LoS conditions with high Rician K-factor. Furthermore, QN methods with the proposed initialization matrix consistently achieve the best convergence performance while maintaining low complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we analyze the performance of mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions approach, which can improve the performance of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CF mMIMO-OFDM) systems under asynchronous reception. To this end, we first obtain the achievable downlink sum-rate for the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions, and then provide a closed-form expression for the case with the maximum ratio precoding. Subsequently, an efficient clustering algorithm is proposed to group access points into different clusters with the same quantized phase shift in each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions can effectively improve the sum-rate of CF mMIMO-OFDM systems under asynchronous reception.</description>

      <title>Identification Codes via Prime Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for construction of identification codes based on prime number generation over the noiseless channels. The earliest method for such construction based on prime numbers was proposed by Ahlswede which relies on algorithms for generation of prime numbers. This method requires knowledge of $2^n$ first prime numbers for identification codes with block length $n,$ which is not computationally efficient. In this work, we revisit Ahlswede's scheme and propose a number of modifications. In particular, employing probabilistic prime generation algorithm, we guarantee that the prime keys generation is possible in polynomial time. Furthermore, additional improvements in terms of type II upper bound are derived and presented. Finally, we propose a method for identification coding based on hash functions which generalizes the Ahlswede's scheme.</description>

      <title>Age and Value of Information Optimization for Systems with Multi-Class Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Received samples of a stochastic process are processed by a server for delivery as updates to a monitor. Each sample belongs to a class that specifies a distribution for its processing time and a function that describes how the value of the processed update decays with age at the monitor. The class of a sample is identified when the processed update is delivered. The server implements a form of M/G/1/1 blocking queue; samples arriving at a busy server are discarded and samples arriving at an idle server are subject to an admission policy that depends on the age and class of the prior delivered update. For the delivered updates, we characterize the average age of information (AoI) and average value of information (VoI). We derive the optimal stationary policy that minimizes the convex combination of the AoI and (negative) VoI. It is shown that the policy has a threshold structure, in which a new sample is allowed to arrive to the server only if the previous update's age and value difference surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the specifics of the value function and system statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the minimum distances of binary linear codes with parity check matrices formed from subset inclusion matrices $W_{t,n,k}$, representing $t$-element subsets versus $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. We provide both lower and upper bounds on the minimum distances of these codes and determine the exact values for any $t\leq 3$ and sufficiently large $n$. Our study combines design and integer linear programming techniques. The codes we consider are connected to locally recoverable codes, LDPC codes and combinatorial designs.</description>

      <title>Third-order Analysis of Channel Coding in the Small-to-Moderate Deviations Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the third-order characteristic of nonsingular discrete memoryless channels and the Gaussian channel with a maximal-power constraint. The third-order term in our expansions employs a new quantity here called the channel skewness, which affects the approximation accuracy more significantly as the error probability decreases. For the Gaussian channel, evaluating Shannon's 1959 random coding bound and Vazquez-Vilar's 2021 meta-converse bound in the central limit theorem (CLT) regime enables exact computation of the channel skewness. For discrete memoryless channels, this work generalizes Moulin's 2017 bounds on the asymptotic expansion of the maximum achievable message set size for nonsingular channels from the CLT regime to include the moderate deviations (MD) regime, thereby refining Altu\u{g} and Wagner's 2014 MD result. For an example binary symmetric channel and most practically important $(n, \epsilon)$ pairs, including $n \in [100, 500]$ and $\epsilon \in [10^{-10}, 10^{-1}]$, an approximation up to the channel skewness is the most accurate among several expansions in the literature. A derivation of the third-order term in the type-II error exponent of binary hypothesis testing in the MD regime is also included; the resulting third-order term is similar to the channel skewness.</description>

      <title>ISAC-Enabled Beam Alignment for Terahertz Networks: Scheme Design and Coverage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key pillar technology for the future 6G networks, Terahertz (THz) communications can provide high-capacity transmissions, but suffers from severe propagation loss and line-of-sight (LoS) blockage that limits the network coverage. Narrow beams are required to compensate for the loss, but they in turn bring in beam misalignment challenge and degrade the THz network coverage. The high sensing resolution of THz signals enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology to assist the LoS blockage and user mobility-induced beam misalignment, enhancing THz network coverage. Based on the 5G beam management, we propose a joint synchronization signal block (SSB) and reference signal (RS)-based sensing (JSRS) scheme to assist beam alignment. JSRS enables a predict-and-prevent procedure that provides early interventions for timely beam switches. To maximize performance of JSRS, we provide an optimal sensing signal insertion and time-to-frequency allocation to improve the joint range and velocity resolutions. We derive the coverage probability of the JSRS-enabled network to evaluate its abilities in beam misalignment reduction and coverage enhancement. The expression also instructs the network density deployment and beamwidth selection. Numerical results show that the JSRS scheme is effective and highly compatible with the 5G air interface. Averaged in the tested urban use cases, JSRS achieves near-ideal performance and reduces around 80% of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by about 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Expectation Propagation MIMO Detection via Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for symbol detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The EP detector shows excellent performance but suffers from a high computational complexity due to the matrix inversion, required in each EP iteration to perform marginal inference on a Gaussian system. We propose an inversion-free variant of the EP algorithm by treating inference on the mean and variance as two separate and simpler subtasks: We study the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for obtaining the mean, which can significantly reduce the complexity and increase stability by relying on the Jacobi preconditioner that proves to fit the EP characteristics very well. For the variance, we use a simple approximation based on linear regression of the Gram channel matrix. Numerical studies on the Rayleigh-fading channel and on a realistic 3GPP channel model reveal the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which offers an attractive performance-complexity tradeoff and even outperforms the original EP detector in high multi-user inference cases where the matrix inversion becomes numerically unstable.</description>

      <title>The Generating Idempotent Is a Minimum-Weight Codeword for Some Binary BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper from 2015, Ding et al. (IEEE Trans. IT, May 2015) conjectured that for odd $m$, the minimum distance of the binary BCH code of length $2^m-1$ and designed distance $2^{m-2}+1$ is equal to the Bose distance calculated in the same paper.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In fact, we prove a stronger result: the weight of the generating idempotent is equal to the Bose distance for both odd and even $m$. Our main tools are some new properties of the so-called fibbinary integers, in particular, the splitting field of related polynomials, and the relation of these polynomials to the idempotent of the BCH code.</description>

      <title>Enhanced BICM Receiver Metrics for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Short Block Channel Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents bit-interleaved coded modulation metrics for joint estimation and detection in short block length channels, addressing scenarios with unknown channel state information and low training dimension density. We show that it is possible to enhance the performance and sensitivity through joint detection-estimation compared to standard receivers, especially when the channel state information is unknown and the density of the training dimensions is low. The performance analysis makes use of a full 5G transmitter and receiver chains for both Polar and LDPC coded transmissions paired with QPSK modulation scheme. We consider transmissions where reference signals are interleaved with data and both are transmitted over a small number of OFDM symbols so that near-perfect channel estimation cannot be achieved. This is particularly adapted to mini-slot transmissions for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) or for short packet random access use cases. Performance evaluation spans SIMO and SU-MIMO configurations, emphasizing the efficacy of BICM detection in realistic base station receiver scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that when the detection windows used in the metric units are on the order of four modulated symbols, the proposed receiver metrics can be used to achieve detection performance that is close to that of a coherent receiver with perfect channel state information.</description>

Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-COM and SIMO-SEN) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer (OB) bounds. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: \textit{i}) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and \textit{ii}) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variational Autoencoders for Parameterized MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose to use a variational autoencoder-based framework for parameterizing a conditional linear minimum mean squared error estimator. The variational autoencoder models the underlying unknown data distribution as conditionally Gaussian, yielding the conditional first and second moments of the estimand, given a noisy observation. The derived estimator is shown to approximate the minimum mean squared error estimator by utilizing the variational autoencoder as a generative prior for the estimation problem. We propose three estimator variants that differ in their access to ground-truth data during the training and estimation phases. The proposed estimator variant trained solely on noisy observations is particularly noteworthy as it does not require access to ground-truth data during training or estimation. We conduct a rigorous analysis by bounding the difference between the proposed and the minimum mean squared error estimator, connecting the training objective and the resulting estimation performance. Furthermore, the resulting bound reveals that the proposed estimator entails a bias-variance tradeoff, which is well-known in the estimation literature. As an example application, we portray channel estimation, allowing for a structured covariance matrix parameterization and low-complexity implementation. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is not limited to channel estimation but can be applied to a broad class of estimation problems. Extensive numerical simulations first validate the theoretical analysis of the proposed variational autoencoder-based estimators and then demonstrate excellent estimation performance compared to related classical and machine learning-based state-of-the-art estimators.</description>

      <title>Gram-Schmidt Methods for Unsupervised Feature Extraction and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature extraction and selection at the presence of nonlinear dependencies among the data is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning. We propose using a Gram-Schmidt (GS) type orthogonalization process over function spaces to detect and map out such dependencies. Specifically, by applying the GS process over some family of functions, we construct a series of covariance matrices that can either be used to identify new large-variance directions, or to remove those dependencies from known directions. In the former case, we provide information-theoretic guarantees in terms of entropy reduction. In the latter, we provide precise conditions by which the chosen function family eliminates existing redundancy in the data. Each approach provides both a feature extraction and a feature selection algorithm. Our feature extraction methods are linear, and can be seen as natural generalization of principal component analysis (PCA). We provide experimental results for synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets which show superior performance over state-of-the-art (linear) feature extraction and selection algorithms. Surprisingly, our linear feature extraction algorithms are comparable and often outperform several important nonlinear feature extraction methods such as autoencoders, kernel PCA, and UMAP. Furthermore, one of our feature selection algorithms strictly generalizes a recent Fourier-based feature selection mechanism (Heidari et al., IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2022), yet at significantly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Non-local Neural Network for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling the capture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across the input, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations that focus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically require computing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading to quadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computational and memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problems can be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalable non-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network (QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies on inherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a large number of input features enabling more efficient computations in quantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships through quantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantum counterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. The simulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levels in binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewer qubits.</description>
