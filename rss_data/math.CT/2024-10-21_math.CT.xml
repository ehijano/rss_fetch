      <title>Stratifying Systems via Nested Family of Torsion Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a nested family of torsion pairs and will prove that this concept is strongly related to the existence of stratifying systems. Specifically, every stratifying system induces a nested family of torsion pairs. Moreover, every stratifying system can be obtained as a quotient or submodule of a module that admits a certain direct sum decomposition with respect to the nested family of torsion pairs. Additionally, we present a stratifying system of infinite size that cannot be indexed by $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>

      <title>Identity-Preserving Lax Extensions and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic notions of bisimulation for various types of systems (nondeterministic, probabilistic, weighted etc.) rely on identity-preserving (normal) lax extensions of the functor encapsulating the system type, in the paradigm of universal coalgebra. It is known that preservation of weak pullbacks is a sufficient condition for a functor to admit a normal lax extension (the Barr extension, which in fact is then even strict); in the converse direction, nothing is currently known about necessary (weak) pullback preservation conditions for the existence of normal lax extensions. In the present work, we narrow this gap by showing on the one hand that functors admitting a normal lax extension preserve 1/4-iso pullbacks, i.e. pullbacks in which at least one of the projections is an isomorphism. On the other hand, we give sufficient conditions, showing that a functor admits a normal lax extension if it weakly preserves either 1/4-iso pullbacks and 4/4-epi pullbacks (i.e. pullbacks in which all morphisms are epic) or inverse images. We apply these criteria to concrete examples, in particular to functors modelling neighbourhood systems and weighted systems.</description>

      <title>Stratifying systems and Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07808v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder property on these filtrations.
  This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition.
  We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</description>

      <title>Cofibrantly generated model structures for functor calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model structures for many different kinds of functor calculus can be obtained by applying a theorem of Bousfield to a suitable category of functors. In this paper, we give a general criterion for when model categories obtained via this approach are cofibrantly generated. Our examples recover the homotopy functor and $n$-excisive model structures of Biedermann and R\"ondigs, with different proofs, but also include a model structure for the discrete functor calculus of Bauer, Johnson, and McCarthy.</description>
