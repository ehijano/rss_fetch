      <title>Outsmarting Linear Neural Networks via an Incoherent Light-Driven Optical Extreme Learner with Data Reverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized fields from computer vision to natural language processing, yet their growing energy and computational demands threaten future progress. Optical neural networks promise greater speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency, but suffer from weak optical nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate a low-power, incoherent-light-driven optical extreme learner that leverages 'data nonlinearity' from optical pattern reverberations, eliminating reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials. By encoding input data in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy matching fully nonlinear digital models. Our compact, energy-efficient approach significantly reduces complexity, cost, and energy consumption, paving the way for practical, scalable all-optical machine learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Observation of multi-orbital Fano resonances in photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonances are a fundamental physical phenomenon that occurs when an open channel couples with a closed one, resulting in a resonant cancellation of transmission. In this article, we introduce a quantum simulator designed to observe multi-orbital Fano resonances using a photonic waveguide analog. The system consists of a homogeneous lattice, which includes a plane wave generator, and an atom-like impurity that supports first-order (S) and second-order (P) modes. We derive a two-impurity Fano-Anderson model to describe this system and fit the experimental results accordingly, demonstrating a remarkable agreement between our experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. A comprehensive experimental characterization reveals clear double resonances for the S and P states, which depend on the properties of the atom and the excitation wavelength. Our results illustrate how the transport of a propagating beam on a lattice can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the properties of a single external atom-like impurity, which works as an efficient energy valve.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamonds: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamonds (NDs) introduces complexities from size, geometry, and surface effects. NVs in NDs show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and total internal reflection. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated NDs appearing brighter than deeper ones in air and provide a unified framework for realistic emission scenarios. Unlike previous models, our approach predicts wavelength-dependent escape efficiencies and position-dependent variations. This integrated model informs the design of brighter NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Light Generation in Periodically Poled Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light play a key role in quantum-enhanced sensing and continuous-variable quantum information processing. Realizing integrated squeezed light sources is crucial for developing compact and scalable photonic quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip broadband vacuum squeezing at telecommunication wavelengths on the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform. Our device integrates periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides with low-loss edge couplers, comprising bilayer inverse tapers and an SU-8 polymer waveguide. This configuration achieves a fiber-to-chip coupling loss of 1.5 dB and a total homodyne detection loss of 3.9 dB, enabling a measured squeezing level of 1.4 dB, which is among the highest reported on the TFLN platform under a continuous-wave pumping scheme. Additional measurements in a more efficient PPLN waveguide (without low-loss couplers) infer an on-chip squeezing level of over 12 dB at a pump power of 62 mW. These results underscore the potential of TFLN platform for efficient and scalable squeezed light generation.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Machine Learning Models for Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08611v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.</description>

      <title>Thermal imaging by utilization of CsPbBr3 quantum dot photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent photoluminescence of perovskite quantum dots (CsPbBr3) in the visible band, is analyzed to evaluate their suitability for use in thermometry. A differential measurement of the photoluminescence can be used to estimate the surface temperature. Thermal imaging is demonstrated by using the Bayer-pattern of a cost-effective consumer-grade digital camera to determine the spectral shift. The temperature change of traces on a printed circuit board are visualized as proof of principle. This technique promises a novel approach for thermal imaging of arbitrary samples with optical resolution (wavelength of ~ 500 nm), instead of typical black-body wavelengths (~ 10 micrometer). Premature degradation of the quantum dots has been mitigated by embedding them in a poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) film, which can then be applied to arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Chirality and Spin with Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light beams with engineered topological properties offer a powerful means to control spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality, key quantities shaped by spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in light. Such effects are typically regarded as emerging only through light-matter interactions. Here, we show that higher-order Poincar\'e modes, carrying a tunable Pancharatnam topological charge $\ell_p$, enable precise control of SOI purely from the intrinsic topology of the light field, without requiring any material interface. In doing so, we reveal a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect, where modulation of $\ell_p$ drives spatial separation of circular polarization states - a direct signature of SOI in a regime previously thought immune to such behaviour. Our analysis identifies two propagation-induced topological mechanisms underlying this effect: differential Gouy phase shifts between orthogonal components, and radial divergence of the beam envelope. These results overturn the common view that spin-orbit effects in free space require non-paraxial conditions, and establish a broadly tunable route to generating and controlling chirality and SAM without tight focusing. This approach provides new opportunities for optical manipulation, chiral sensing, and high-dimensional photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>A Broadband Squeezed Light Source for Table-Top Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the characterisation of one of two broadband squeezed light sources developed for the Quantum Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment, using balanced homodyne detection. QUEST consists of a pair of co-located, table-top, power-recycled Michelson interferometers designed to probe stationary space-time fluctuations. The interferometers are designed to be shot-noise limited in the frequency range from 1 to 200 MHz, and squeezed light will be employed with the goal to reduce the shot noise by 6 dB at frequencies inside the linewidth of the optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We directly observed up to 6.8 dB of squeezing and maintained at least 3 dB of squeezing across the full 100 MHz measurement bandwidth. After accounting for the dark noise contribution, the inferred squeezing level increased to 8.6 dB. Our squeezed light source is based on a hemilithic OPA with a 43.6 mm round-trip optical length and a linewidth of 138 MHz, making it the broadest-linewidth device to date among those suitable for long-term operation.</description>

      <title>High-resolution luminescence spectroscopy of CaWO$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$: Sensitive detection of internal strains, temperature, and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out high-resolution (0.02 cm-1) measurements of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+, including in magnetic field, and performed spectra modeling. Well-resolved hyperfine structure was observed in the luminescence spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+ for the first time. Energies of several crystal-field levels were specified, g-factors were determined. Variations of a magnetic field as small as several tenths of mT can be detected from the PL spectra. We show that the PL spectra are much more sensitive to lattice strains in CaWO4:Ho3+ than the absorption spectra. The spectra were simulated using refined crystal-field parameters and taking into account both hyperfine and deformation interactions. Here, we used the previously obtained distribution function of random strains induced by point lattice defects in an elastically anisotropic CaWO4 crystal. A luminescence thermometer for temperatures around 20 K based on CaWO4:Ho3+ is suggested.</description>

      <title>Unveiling orbital optical chirality through multipolar chiral light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Verification Method for Pointing and Acquisition Performance of Space Optical Communication System with Sub-Second Acquisition Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the urgent need for sub-second link establishment in inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground free space optical communication, this paper presents a periscope-type optical communication terminal and a ground-based verification scheme for its pointing accuracy and acquisition performance, thereby avoiding costly in-orbit tests. This ground-based measurement method takes the positions of stellar constellations in inertial space as its reference. By establishing a theoretical attitude determination model for the optical terminal and analyzing both structural and non-structural error sources that affect its pointing, it proposes an error-compensated, high-precision evaluation technique for open-loop pointing. Combined with laboratory component tests, it also derives a measurement method for acquisition time. Field experiments show that the mean pointing error is reduced from 2070.24 microrad to 120.16 microrad after error correction, corresponding to an improvement exceeding 94%. Acquisition tests report an average equivalent acquisition time of 0.908 s, with every run completed in under 1 s. These results demonstrate that the developed terminal achieves high-precision pointing and sub-second acquisition, and they validate the effectiveness of the proposed ground-based verification method.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the optical response from variant InGaN nanowires emitting within the green spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive physical and optical investigation of InGaN nanowires (NWs) designed to address the challenges posed by the green gap region. We conduct a detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and optical characteristics of the NWs using characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal scanning microscopy. Notably, increasing the indium concentration causes a redshift in emission and alters the luminescence properties across different segments of NWs.
  Our findings provide valuable insight into the correlation between indium compositional nonuniformity and the optical emission properties of NWs. These insights contribute to optimizing the growth condition, color accuracy, and enhancing optical efficiency of NWs, highlighting their potential for next generation high-performance LEDs and optoelectronics devices.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic exciton-polaritons reveal non-Hermitian topology in van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics, offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry Breaking to Enhance the Sagnac Effect in a Microresonator Gyroscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect have been widely used for inertial navigation in aircrafts, submarines, satellites and unmanned robotics. With the rapid progress in the field of ultrahigh-quality whispering gallery mode and ring resonators in recent years, these devices offer the promise of a compact alternative to ring-laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and fiber-optic gyroscopes (FOGs). Yet, successful commercialization of a microresonator gyroscope has been hindered by the scaling of the Sagnac effect with resonator area. While several techniques have been proposed to enhance the Sagnac effect in microresonators, these enhancements also amplify the thermal noise in the microresonator. Here, we present a novel approach to measuring the Sagnac signal in chip-scale devices that overcomes this fundamental noise limitation to achieve unprecedented performance in a 200 {\mu}m optical resonator - the smallest reported to date. Our proof-of-concept design shows a 10^4 enhancement of the Sagnac signal while simultaneously suppressing thermal noise by 27 dB and environmental contributions to noise by 22 dB. We believe this approach offers a pathway for integrated photonic gyroscopes with sensitivities that match or exceed RLGs and FOGs.</description>

Abstract: The on-demand manipulation of triplet states in closed-shell single molecules is still out of reach due to a lack of information about the energy of those triplet states. Yet, the access to triplet states would open up a route towards an all-optical single-molecule photonic switch/transistor and, moreover, would provide a way of performing coherent spin operations from the spin-less ground state. In this work, we take an important step towards those aims by measuring the triplet energy from the weak phosphorescence signal of perdeuterated perylene, embedded as a guest molecule in a dibenzothiophene host matrix, which well preserves the coherence properties of the perylene guest. We find that perylene's phosphorescence can be enhanced in this host matrix, when acting as an intermediary for the generation of triplet excitons. The triplet energy that we find can be used to significantly narrow down the search for the ultra-weak spin-forbidden transitions from the ground singlet to the triplet states of a single molecule.</description>

      <title>Additive manufacturing in aluminium of a primary mirror for a CubeSat application: manufacture, testing and evaluation</title>

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D Printing), a process which creates a part layer-by-layer, has the potential to improve upon conventional lightweight mirror manufacturing techniques, including subtractive (milling), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing. Increased mass reduction whilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation of intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture conventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the number of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation using computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature. However, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface, is required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised. This paper outlines the development &amp; metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat platform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid body. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design, with a focus on manufacture, testing &amp; evaluation. This is achieved through a simplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted within a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external diameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription is flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a low-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They were then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective surface. Both quantitative &amp; qualitative evaluations of the optical surface were conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the optical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface porosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently, optical scatter.</description>

      <title>Weak measurement in strong laser field physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advantage of attosecond measurements is the possibility of time-resolving ultrafast quantum phenomena of electron dynamics. Many such measurements are of interferometric nature, and therefore give access to the phase. Likewise, weak measurements are intrinsically interferometric and specifically take advantage of interfering probability amplitudes, therefore encoding the phase information of the process. In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore, extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond quantum interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of polarisation on two-photon resonance in a large Zeeman manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present numerical investigations on a large Zeeman manifold in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium, focusing on the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb as our model system. We examine two distinct models comprising 13 and 16 energy levels, respectively, using pump-probe spectroscopy with varying polarization of the light fields. A longitudinal magnetic field is used, and the ellipticity of both light fields is varied with the constraint that both lights have orthogonal polarization. We discover that in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field, the change in ellipticity of light polarization induces optical anisotropy. This anisotropy results from the uneven distribution of population among the ground Zeeman levels, leading to the absorption of weak probe light. For a large number of states interacting with different field components, the existence of a steady state depends upon the multi-photon resonance and phase matching conditions. A comment is made on why such conditions are not required in our model, and the assumptions and limitations of the model are also discussed. To validate our numerical findings, we perform experimental measurements at two different magnetic field strengths in the D2 line of 87 Rb. The experimental results align well with our numerical simulations. Specifically, we conclude that the probe transmission spectra at lower magnetic field values (up to 20 G) exhibit similarity for both the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb, effectively described by the 13-level model. However, at higher magnetic field values, a more complicated 16-level (or higher) system is necessary to accurately capture the response of the probe in D2 line.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for three-dimensional FDTD simulations of passive silicon photonic components</title>

Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Five devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, and polarization splitter rotator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory. We compare simulation accuracy, runtime, and transmission spectra across varying resolutions and bandwidths. Results reinforce that both solver are reliable with minimal discrepancies. Overall, Tidy3D is well suited for rapid prototyping while Lumerical FDTD remains a robust option for complex simulations.</description>

      <title>Sub-Poissonian Light in a Waveguide Kerr-medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. Modern $\text{Si}_3\text{N}_4$ chip waveguides are attractive due to their high Kerr nonlinearity, suppressed Brillouin scattering on guided acoustic waves (GAWBS), and lengths up to one meter. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer new analytical formulas for estimating the capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled via Heat Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study laser induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in a ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effects of direct laser excitation and ultrashort hot electron pulses. A wedged Cu layer is deposited atop the spin valve to tune energy transmission to the magnetic stack for both optical and hot-electron excitation. We demonstrate single shot magnetization reversal of the free layer using hot electron pulses. Moreover, such reversal is achieved even with picosecond laser pulses. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. Our results indicate that the key factor enabling magnetization reversal is full demagnetization of the free layer, driven by a rapid rise in its electronic temperature achieved via either direct laser or hot electron excitation. This work advances the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal via nonlocal heat and spin transport under strongly out of equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric and wave optics in a BTZ optical metric-based wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric and wave optical properties of a $(2+1)$-dimensional ultra-static spacetime conformally related to the static BTZ black hole, characterized by constant negative Gaussian curvature. The associated optical metric defines a hyperbolic wormhole geometry, wherein null geodesics experience a P\"oschl--Teller-type repulsive effective potential that suppresses circular photon orbits and directs all trajectories toward the optical origin. In the wave regime, we reformulate the Helmholtz equation into a Schr\"odinger-like form, revealing a spatially localized effective potential that encodes curvature and angular momentum effects. The resulting refractive index $n(\rho,\omega)$ is both spatially and spectrally dispersive, leading to a position-dependent critical frequency $\omega_c(\rho)$ that delineates the boundary between propagating and evanescent modes. At high frequencies, the medium becomes asymptotically transparent, while for $\omega &lt; \omega_c(\rho)$, waves undergo exponential attenuation. These results demonstrate intrinsic curvature-induced spectral filtering and provide a geometrically tunable framework for analog gravity systems and graphene-based photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch band theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian bands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher dimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on the system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a universal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains its origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for the first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ framework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is the superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of validity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological effects and non-Hermitian Chern bands.</description>
