      <title>Square matrix-based six-dimensional convergence map for nonlinear beam dynamics analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square matrix-based convergence map (CM) method has proven effective in characterizing nonlinear dynamics in several 4-D dynamical systems. However, when time-dependent perturbations, such as crabbing kicks in colliders, are present, a comprehensive 6-D analysis becomes essential to accurately capture the coupling between transverse and longitudinal motions. In this work, we extend the CM method to the full 6-D phase space by employing an eigen-decomposition-based formulation of the square matrix combined with iterative procedures. The proposed 6-D CM approach is first validated using a simplified crabbing map. We demonstrate that the 6-D CM preserves computational efficiency by using only one-turn map, while successfully resolving high-order resonance structures that remain unresolved by conventional frequency map analysis (FMA). This method is subsequently applied to the dynamic aperture (DA) study of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The results obtained from the CM analysis exhibit close agreement with those derived from FMA, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for nonlinear beam dynamics analysis and DA evaluation, as well as for broader applications in other nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>
