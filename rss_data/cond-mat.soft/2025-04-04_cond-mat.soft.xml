      <title>Experimental evidence of non-equilibrium phase separation in supercritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercritical fluids (SCFs) have long been considered homogeneous and structureless, yet recent studies suggest the existence of transient, liquid-like clusters under dynamic processes. In this study, we provide experimental evidence of semi-stable non-equilibrium phase separation in SCFs through opacity measurements and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). By investigating the thermophysical properties of helium, argon, and krypton during adiabatic expansion, we show that cooling dynamics vary significantly among species, influencing cluster formation. Neutron scattering measurements reveal distinct variations in signal intensity, supporting that the clusters slowly dissolve into the background with a surprisingly long time scale of tens of minutes. Given that SCFs in industrial applications frequently experience dynamic, non-equilibrium conditions rather than in strict thermodynamic equilibrium, our results provide crucial insights with potential implications for advanced material processing, energy systems, and chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Exact characterization of anisotropic properties in confined hard-sphere systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions are possible. By mapping the Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical expressions for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial coefficients, and extreme pressures. Additionally, we identify a transition in the anisotropic pressure components, where the transverse pressure surpasses the longitudinal one at high densities if the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, we analyze spatial correlations in particle arrangements and fluctuations in radial positioning, providing insight into the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Response of magnetic particle to rotating magnetic field in viscoelastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational dynamics of a freely suspended ferromagnetic particle in viscoelastic fluid subjected to a rotating magnetic field is studied by experiments and theory. Our result reveals that when the characteristic relaxation time of the fluid is much smaller than the inverse critical field frequency, the particle's rotation behavior aligns with that in Newtonian fluids. Increasing the relaxation time enhances the time-averaged rotation frequency of the particle that undergo asynchronous rotation. Moreover, the critical frequency is shown to scale linearly with the magnetic field intensity and inversely with the fluid's zero-shear viscosity. Our work is expected to guide precise manipulation of ferromagnetic particles in biomedical systems where viscoelastic environments dominate.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal elastic filaments for viscous propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propulsion of many eukaryotic cells is generated by flagella, flexible slender filaments that are actively oscillating in space and time. The dynamics of these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of artificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion depends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in turn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In this work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical (bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using mathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a slender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the optimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the time-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing a specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based variational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of bending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff near the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that depends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These findings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Optimal first-passage times of active Brownian particles under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of an active Brownian particle under stochastic resetting to its initial configuration, comprising its position and orientation, to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Coupling a perturbative approach for low P\'eclet numbers, measuring the relative importance of self-propulsion with respect to diffusion, with the renewal framework for the stochastic resetting process, we derive analytical expressions for the survival probability, the FPT probability density, and the associated low-order moments. Depending on their initial orientation, the minimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease and increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal resetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary due to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and active motion.</description>

      <title>Rigid m-percolation in limited-valence gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the onset of rigidity in gels is a fundamental challenge with significant practical implications across different applications. Limited-valence, or patchy-particle systems have proven to be a valuable model to study the relationship between microscopic interactions and macroscopic mechanical properties. It has been suggested that the emergence of rigidity coincides with the formation of an infinitely spanning cluster of particles with at least three bonds. This work explores this hypothesis, its implications, and its broader applicability across a range of system parameters, by associating the emergence of rigidity with m-percolation transition for m=3. The properties of m-percolation are developed using a mean-field theoretical approach validated with numerical simulations, and used to build phase and rigidity diagrams for different particle valences of both single-component systems and binary mixtures of patchy particles. The difference between connectivity and rigidity percolation thresholds is found to reduce with increasing valence, providing an explanation for the challenges encountered in experimental attempts to distinguish isotropic connectivity percolation from the onset of rigidity. For binary mixtures, we found a robust minimum average valence, below which the gel is never rigid.</description>

      <title>Aging of ring polymeric topological glass formers via thermal quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical response of glass-forming systems composed of topologically constrained ring polymers subjected to an instantaneous thermal quench, employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the onset of glassiness depends on polymer stiffness, with increased rigidity enhancing configurational constraints and delaying structural relaxation. In the glassy regime, the system exhibits hallmark aging characteristics, as evidenced by two-time correlation functions, namely the mean square displacement and self-intermediate scattering function, which display a clear dependence on the waiting time following the thermal quench. The extracted relaxation timescale ($\tau_\alpha$) follows an approximate simple aging scenario with waiting time ($t_w$), described by $\tau_\alpha \sim t_w^b$, where $0.8 &lt; b &lt; 0.93$. Finally, we analyze the threading of rings during the thermal quench, demonstrating that both increased and persistent threading correlate with the emergence of glassiness. Moreover, the threading persistence timescale exhibits a strong correlation with the structural relaxation timescale. Our study thus provides a comprehensive view of structural relaxation and aging in dense ring polymer systems, highlighting the critical roles of topological constraints and polymer stiffness in governing non-equilibrium glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of collective dynamics and turbulent-like energy cascades in active granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles." These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Brownian particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe and predict this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, we show that topological defects play a crucial role in the development of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings demonstrate how topological concepts can be applied to predict macroscopic collective phenomena in apolar active matter. This establishes a direct link between microscopic topological dynamics and large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids.</description>

      <title>Non-linear elasticity effects and stratification in brushes of branched polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brushes formed by arm-tethered starlike polyelectrolytes may exhibit internal segregation into weakly and strongly extended populations (stratified two-layer structure) when strong ionic intermolecular repulsions induce stretching of the tethers up to the limit of their extensibility. We propose an approximate Poisson-Boltzmann theory for analysis of the structure of the stratified brush and compare it with results of numerical self-consistent field modelling. Both analytical and numerical models point to formation of a narrow cloud of counterions (internal double electrical layer) localized inside stratified brush at the boundary between the layers.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for characterizing the mechanical behavior of atrial tissue using constitutive neural networks. Based on experimental biaxial tensile test data of healthy human atria, we automatically discover the most appropriate constitutive material model, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional, pre-defined models. This approach offers a new perspective on modeling atrial mechanics and is a significant step towards improved simulation and prediction of cardiac health.</description>

      <title>Minimal cyclic behavior in sheared amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although jammed packings of soft spheres exist in potential energy landscapes with a vast number of minima, when subjected to cyclic shear they may revisit the same configurations repeatedly. Simple hysteretic spin models, in which particle rearrangements are represented by interacting spin flips called hysterons, capture many features of this periodic behavior. Yet it has been unclear to what extent individual rearrangements can be described by such binary objects and how such objects interact with one another. Using a particularly sensitive algorithm, we identify rearrangements in simulated jammed packings and select pairs of rearrangements that undo one another to create periodic cyclic behavior. We find that the rearrangement pairs surprisingly persist down to the smallest increments in strain, even in the smallest systems we can study. We explore the statistics of these rearrangement pairs and find that there is a relation between the amount of hysteresis and the energy drop and mean-square displacement of the particles; these results are inconsistent with the scaling found in models that treat rearrangements as localized buckling events. Finally, our analysis shows that there is no clean distinction between the "core" of an individual rearrangement and the interactions between rearrangements. These results offer insight into how complex systems such as amorphous solids can reach a limit cycle.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Forces, Particle Rearrangements, and Macroscopic Stress Fluctuations in Sheared 2D Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that particles exhibiting the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, first coalesce into a single connected cluster during slip events. This cluster coincides with the region experiencing the greatest instantaneous reduction of inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within this cluster correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion were included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Localized tension-induced giant folding in unstructured elastic sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from `groovy metasheets' for multi-stable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counter-intuitive behavior -- a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension -- occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as `localized TUG folding' to reflect the importance of localized tension and its mode of actuation. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression -- a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular materials are defined as collections of macroscopic dissipative particles. Although these systems are ubiquitous in our lives, the nature and the causes of their non-trivial collective dynamics still remain elusive and have attracted significant interest in non-equilibrium physics. Here, we focus on the vibrational dynamics of granular materials. While the vibrational dynamics of random packings have been examined concerning the jamming transition, previous research has overlooked the role of contact dissipations. We conducted numerical and analytical investigations into the vibrational dynamics of random packings influenced by the normal dissipative force, which is the simplest model for contact dissipations. Our findings reveal that the kinetic energy per mode diverges in the low-frequency range, following the scaling law $\mathcal{K}_l \propto \omega^{-2}_l$ with the frequency $\omega_l$, indicating that low-frequency modes experience strong excitation and that the equipartition of energy is violated. Additionally, the spatial structure factor of the velocity field displays the scaling law $S_v(q) \propto q^{-2}$ with the wavenumber $q$, which signifies that the velocity field has an infinitely long range. We demonstrate that these phenomena arise from the effects of weaker damping on softer modes, where the particle displacements parallel to the contacts are minimal in the low-frequency modes, rendering normal dissipation ineffective at dampening these modes.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised by viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral (PVB) confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The driver is connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes at the same time oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with Champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>
