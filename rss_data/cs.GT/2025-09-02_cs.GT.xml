      <title>Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman, Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Mechanisms for Facility Location with Prediction Under the Maximum Cost Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mechanism design problem of facility location on a metric space in the learning-augmented framework, where mechanisms have access to an imperfect prediction of optimal facility locations. Our goal is to design strategyproof (SP) mechanisms to elicit agent preferences on the facility locations truthfully and, leveraging the given imperfect prediction, determine the facility location that approximately minimizes the maximum cost among all agents. In particular, we seek SP mechanisms whose approximation guarantees depend on the prediction errors -- achieve improved guarantees when the prediction is accurate (known as the \emph{consistency}), while still ensuring robust worst-case performance when the prediction is arbitrarily inaccurate (known as the \emph{robustness}).
  When the metric space is the real line, we characterize all deterministic SP mechanisms with consistency strictly less than 2 and bounded robustness: such mechanisms must be the MinMaxP mechanism, which returns the prediction location if it lies between the two extreme agent locations and, otherwise, returns the closest agent location to the prediction. We further show that, for any prediction error $\eta\ge 0$, while MinMaxP is $(1+\min(1, \eta))$-approximation, no deterministic SP mechanism can achieve a better approximation. In two-dimensional spaces with the $l_p$ metric, we analyze the approximation guarantees of a deterministic mechanism that runs MinMaxP independently on each coordinate, as well as a randomized mechanism that selects between two deterministic ones with specific probabilities. Finally, we discuss the group strategyproofness of the considered mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Mean-payoff and Energy Discrete Bidding Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{bidding} game is played on a graph as follows. A token is placed on an initial vertex and both players are allocated budgets. In each turn, the players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed their available budgets, the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to the lower bidder. We focus on \emph{discrete}-bidding, which are motivated by practical applications and restrict the granularity of the players' bids, e.g, bids must be given in cents. We study, for the first time, discrete-bidding games with {\em mean-payoff} and {\em energy} objectives. In contrast, mean-payoff {\em continuous}-bidding games (i.e., no granularity restrictions) are understood and exhibit a rich mathematical structure. The {\em threshold} budget is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning an energy game or guaranteeing a target payoff in a mean-payoff game. We first establish existence of threshold budgets; a non-trivial property due to the concurrent moves of the players. Moreover, we identify the structure of the thresholds, which is key in obtaining compact strategies, and in turn, showing that finding threshold is in \NP~and \coNP even in succinctly-represented games.</description>

      <title>Quantum game models for interaction-aware decision-making in automated driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game - Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Existence of Constrained Secure Equilibria in Multi-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-player non-zero-sum turn-based game (abbreviated as multi-player game) on a finite directed graph. A secure equilibrium (SE) is a strategy profile in which no player has the incentive to deviate from the strategy because no player can increase her own payoff or lower the payoff of another player. SE is a promising refinement of Nash equilibrium in which a player does not care the payoff of another player. In this paper, we discuss the decidability and complexity of the problem of deciding whether a secure equilibrium with constraints (a payoff profile specifying which players must win) exists for a given multi-player game.</description>

      <title>Entry Barriers in Content Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier, involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality. Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier online ecosystems.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Polynomial-Time Combinatorial Algorithm for the Nucleolus in Convex Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleolus is a fundamental solution concept in cooperative game theory, yet computing it is NP-hard in general. In convex games-where players' marginal contributions grow with coalition size-the only existing polynomial-time algorithm relies on the ellipsoid method. We re-examine a reduced game approach, refuting a previously claimed polynomial-time implementation and clarifying why it fails. By developing new algorithmic ideas and exploiting the structure of least core polyhedra, we show that reduced games can in fact be used effectively. This yields the first combinatorial and strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the nucleolus in convex games.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Information in Incentive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.</description>

      <title>Selecting Interlacing Committees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is a major concern for a well-functioning society. Often, mass polarization of a society is driven by polarizing political representation, even when the latter is easily preventable. The existing computational social choice methods for the task of committee selection are not designed to address this issue. We enrich the standard approach to committee selection by defining two quantitative measures that evaluate how well a given committee interconnects the voters. Maximizing these measures aims at avoiding polarizing committees. While the corresponding maximization problems are NP-complete in general, we obtain efficient algorithms for profiles in the voter-candidate interval domain. Moreover, we analyze the compatibility of our goals with other representation objectives, such as excellence, diversity, and proportionality. We identify trade-offs between approximation guarantees, and describe algorithms that achieve simultaneous constant-factor approximations.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging with Day-Ahead Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Nash Q-Network for Multi-Agent Cybersecurity Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties (namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a steady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this algorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player zero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to learn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in cybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep Q-network (DQN), and the Nash-Q algorithm, addressing common challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent learning. The training process employs distributed data collection and carefully designed neural architectures for both agents and critics.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization: Addressing Theoretical Risks in Neural Fictitious Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.</description>

      <title>ShortageSim: Simulating Drug Shortages under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex, strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information, \textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source \textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex, information-scarce supply chains.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in Two-Sided Attention Markets: Objective, Optimization, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With most content distributed online and mediated by platforms, there is a pressing need to understand the ecosystem of content creation and consumption. A considerable body of recent work shed light on the one-sided market on creator-platform or user-platform interactions, showing key properties of static (Nash) equilibria and online learning. In this work, we examine the {\it two-sided} market including the platform and both users and creators. We design a potential function for the coupled interactions among users, platform and creators. We show that such coupling of creators' best-response dynamics with users' multilogit choices is equivalent to mirror descent on this potential function. Furthermore, a range of platform ranking strategies correspond to a family of potential functions, and the dynamics of two-sided interactions still correspond to mirror descent. We also provide new local convergence result for mirror descent in non-convex functions, which could be of independent interest. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for explaining the diverse outcomes observed in attention markets.</description>

      <title>Calibration through the Lens of Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.</description>

      <title>Gaming and Cooperation in Federated Learning: What Can Happen and How to Monitor It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss, and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure, evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds, auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and expanding stable cooperation.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new model of combinatorial contracts in which a principal delegates the execution of a costly task to an agent. To complete the task, the agent can take any subset of a given set of unobservable actions, each of which has an associated cost. The cost of a set of actions is the sum of the costs of the individual actions, and the principal's reward as a function of the chosen actions satisfies some form of diminishing returns. The principal incentivizes the agents through a contract, based on the observed outcome.
  Our main results are for the case where the task delegated to the agent is a project, which can be successful or not. We show that if the success probability as a function of the set of actions is gross substitutes, then an optimal contract can be computed with polynomially many value queries, whereas if it is submodular, the optimal contract is NP-hard. All our results extend to linear contracts for higher-dimensional outcome spaces, which we show to be robustly optimal given first moment constraints.
  Our analysis uncovers a new property of gross substitutes functions, and reveals many interesting connections between combinatorial contracts and combinatorial auctions, where gross substitutes is known to be the frontier for efficient computation.</description>

      <title>Approximating Nash Social Welfare by Matching and Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\eps&gt;0$, we give a simple, deterministic $(4+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the Nash social welfare (NSW) problem under submodular valuations. We also consider the asymmetric variant of the problem, where the objective is to maximize the weighted geometric mean of agents' valuations, and give an $\ee (\omega + 2 + \eps)$-approximation if the ratio between the largest weight and the average weight is at most $\omega$.
  We also show that the $\nfrac12$-EFX envy-freeness property can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation. More precisely, we can find an allocation in polynomial time that is both $\nfrac12$-EFX and a $(8+\eps)$-approximation to the symmetric NSW problem under submodular valuations.</description>

      <title>On the Nucleolus of a Class of Linear Production Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nucleolus in a class of cooperative games where agents collaborate by sharing demands and production-distribution capacities across multiple markets. These production-distribution games form a structured subclass of linear production games and capture applications such as horizontal collaboration in logistics. While computing the nucleolus is generally NP-hard for linear production games, we show that structural properties of production-distribution games enable efficient computation in several cases. Our main results focus on the uncapacitated variant. First, we provide a polynomial-time characterization of instances where the core reduces to a singleton, allowing direct computation of the nucleolus. Second, when the number of markets is fixed, we design a separation-based polynomial-time algorithm. Third, in the single-market case, we develop a faster combinatorial primal-dual algorithm that runs in $O(n^4)$.</description>

      <title>Worst-case control via linear programming: applications to truncation selection and partially malicious players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between game theory, convex optimization, and geometry is deep. There are many applications of linear programming methods and polyhedral representation conversion methods in game theory. In this paper, we discuss two more scenarios where such methods can be useful. The first scenario is predicting the results of independent truncation dynamics under the large population assumption. The second scenario is when a player's opponent in a normal form game is not completely rational but shows some degree of malice. We show how one can compute a more profitable defensive play compared to simply playing a maximin strategy. We provide detailed computation procedure and numerical results for both scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deviation Between Team-Optimal Solution and Nash Equilibrium in Flow Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of strategy deviation on team performance. As a working use case, we focus on a class of flow assignment problems in which each source node acts as a cooperating decision maker (DM) within a team that minimizes the team cost based on the team-optimal strategy. In practice, some selfish DMs may prioritize their own marginal cost and deviate from NE strategies, thus potentially degrading the overall performance. To quantify this deviation, we explore the deviation bound between the team-optimal solution and the NE in two specific scenarios: (i) when the team-optimal solution is unique and (ii) when multiple solutions do exist. This helps DMs analyze the factors influencing the deviation and adopting the NE strategy within a tolerable range. Furthermore, in the special case of a potential game model, we establish the consistency between the team-optimal solution and the NE. Once the consistency condition is satisfied, the strategy deviation does not alter the total cost, and DMs do not face a strategic trade-off. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through some simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Charitable Donations with Leontief Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of funding public goods that are complementary in nature. Examples include charities handling different needs (e.g., protecting animals vs. providing healthcare), charitable donations to different individuals, or municipal units handling different issues (e.g., security vs. transportation). We model these complementarities by assuming Leontief preferences; that is, each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities. Decentralized funding may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination among the donors; centralized funding may be undesirable as it ignores the preferences of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods. The mechanism efficiently distributes each donor's contribution so that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, and can be implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Screening with Precise Seller Information</title>

Abstract: A multi-product monopolist faces a buyer who is privately informed about his valuations for the goods. As is well-known, optimal mechanisms are in general complicated, while simple mechanisms -- such as pure bundling or separate sales -- can be far from optimal and do not admit clear-cut comparisons. We show that this changes if the monopolist has sufficiently precise information about the buyer's valuations: Now, pure bundling always outperforms separate sales; moreover, there is a sense in which pure bundling performs essentially as well as the optimal mechanism. To formalize this, we characterize how fast the corresponding revenues converge to the first-best revenue as the monopolist's information grows precise: Pure bundling achieves the same convergence rate to the first-best as optimal mechanisms; in contrast, the convergence rate under separate sales is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>
