      <title>Rendering LaTeX in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The xdvir package provides functions for rendering LaTeX fragments as labels, annotations, and data symbols in R plots. There are convenient high-level functions for rendering LaTeX fragments, including labels on ggplot2 plots, plus lower-level functions for more fine control over the separate authoring, typesetting, and rendering steps. There is support for making use of LaTeX packages, including TikZ graphics. The rendered LaTeX output is fully integrated with R graphics output in the sense that LaTeX output can be positioned and sized relative to R graphics output and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Taylor's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem for Random Functions and Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the often-overlooked issue of measurability at intermediate points when applying Taylor's theorems to random functions and random vectors (e.g., likelihood functions with respect to estimators) in statistics. Classical Taylor-related theorems were originally developed for deterministic settings. Consequently, they do not directly extend to stochastic functions and variables and do not inherently guarantee the measurability of intermediate points. In statistical contexts, applying these theorems without properly accounting for randomness can lead to analyses that lack well-defined probabilistic interpretations. Elementary approaches, such as pointwise constructions, are insufficient for handling random quantities and establishing measurable intermediate points. Moreover, some statistical literature has implicitly disregarded this issue, often neglecting the stochastic nature of the problem and assuming that intermediate points are measurable. To address this gap, we develop multivariate Taylor's and mean value theorems tailored for random functions and random variables under mild assumptions. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating the applicability of our results to commonly used statistical methods, including maximum likelihood estimation, $M$-estimation, and profile estimation. Our findings contribute a rigorous foundation for the applications of Taylor expansions in statistics.</description>
