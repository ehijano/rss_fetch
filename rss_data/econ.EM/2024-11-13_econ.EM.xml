      <title>Dynamic Evolutionary Game Analysis of How Fintech in Banking Mitigates Risks in Agricultural Supply Chain Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of banking fintech on reducing financial risks in the agricultural supply chain, focusing on the secondary allocation of commercial credit. The study constructs a three-player evolutionary game model involving banks, core enterprises, and SMEs to analyze how fintech innovations, such as big data credit assessment, blockchain, and AI-driven risk evaluation, influence financial risks and access to credit. The findings reveal that banking fintech reduces financing costs and mitigates financial risks by improving transaction reliability, enhancing risk identification, and minimizing information asymmetry. By optimizing cooperation between banks, core enterprises, and SMEs, fintech solutions enhance the stability of the agricultural supply chain, contributing to rural revitalization goals and sustainable agricultural development. The study provides new theoretical insights and practical recommendations for improving agricultural finance systems and reducing financial risks.
  Keywords: banking fintech, agricultural supply chain, financial risk, commercial credit, SMEs, evolutionary game model, big data, blockchain, AI-driven risk evaluation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Competition on Psychological Pricing Strategies: Preliminary Evidence from an Online Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According zu Kadir et al. (2023) online marketplaces are used to buy and sell products and services, as well as to exchange money and data between users or the platform. Due to the large product selection, low costs and the ease of shopping without physical restrictions as well as the technical possibilities, online marketplaces have grown rapidly Kadir et al. (2023). Online marketplaces are also used in the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sector and thus offer a broad user group a marketplace, for example for used products. This article focuses on Willhaben.at (2024), a leading C2C marketplace in Austria, as stated by Obersteiner, Schmied, and Pamperl (2023). The empirical analysis in this course essay centers around the offer ads of Woom Bikes, a standardised product which is sold on Willhaben. Through web scraping, a dataset of approximately 826 observations was created, focusing on mid-to-high price segment bicycles, which are characterized by price stability and uniformity as we claim. This analysis aims to create analyse ad listing prices through predictive models using willhaben product listing attributes and using the spatial distribution of one of the product attributes.</description>

      <title>Impact of R&amp;D and AI Investments on Economic Growth and Credit Rating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research and development (R&amp;D) phase is essential for fostering innovation and aligns with long-term strategies in both public and private sectors. This study addresses two primary research questions: (1) assessing the relationship between R&amp;D investments and GDP through regression analysis, and (2) estimating the economic value added (EVA) that Georgia must generate to progress from a BB to a BBB credit rating. Using World Bank data from 2014-2022, this analysis found that increasing R&amp;D, with an emphasis on AI, by 30-35% has a measurable impact on GDP. Regression results reveal a coefficient of 7.02%, indicating a 10% increase in R&amp;D leads to a 0.70% GDP rise, with an 81.1% determination coefficient and a strong 90.1% correlation.
  Georgia's EVA model was calculated to determine the additional value needed for a BBB rating, comparing indicators from Greece, Hungary, India, and Kazakhstan as benchmarks. Key economic indicators considered were nominal GDP, GDP per capita, real GDP growth, and fiscal indicators (government balance/GDP, debt/GDP). The EVA model projects that to achieve a BBB rating within nine years, Georgia requires $61.7 billion in investments. Utilizing EVA and comprehensive economic indicators will support informed decision-making and enhance the analysis of Georgia's economic trajectory.</description>

      <title>Matching $\leq$ Hybrid $\leq$ Difference in Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since LaLonde's (1986) seminal paper, there has been ongoing interest in estimating treatment effects using pre- and post-intervention data. Scholars have traditionally used experimental benchmarks to evaluate the accuracy of alternative econometric methods, including Matching, Difference-in-Differences (DID), and their hybrid forms (e.g., Heckman et al., 1998b; Dehejia and Wahba, 2002; Smith and Todd, 2005). We revisit these methodologies in the evaluation of job training and educational programs using four datasets (LaLonde, 1986; Heckman et al., 1998a; Smith and Todd, 2005; Chetty et al., 2014a; Athey et al., 2020), and show that the inequality relationship, Matching $\leq$ Hybrid $\leq$ DID, appears as a consistent norm, rather than a mere coincidence. We provide a formal theoretical justification for this puzzling phenomenon under plausible conditions such as negative selection, by generalizing the classical bracketing (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, Section 5). Consequently, when treatments are expected to be non-negative, DID tends to provide optimistic estimates, while Matching offers more conservative ones. Keywords: bias, difference in differences, educational program, job training program, matching.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. In RD designs, treatment effects are estimated in a quasi-experimental setting where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is to apply nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. In such an approach, the validity relies heavily on the consistency of nonparametric estimators and is limited by the nonparametric convergence rate, thereby preventing $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To address these issues, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. If either of these estimators is consistent, the treatment effect estimator remains consistent. Furthermore, due to the debiasing effect, our proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency if both regression estimators satisfy certain mild conditions, which also simplifies statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Factor-augmented sparse MIDAS regressions with an application to nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates factor-augmented sparse MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) regressions for high-dimensional time series data, which may be observed at different frequencies. Our novel approach integrates sparse and dense dimensionality reduction techniques. We derive the convergence rate of our estimator under misspecification, $\tau$-mixing dependence, and polynomial tails. Our method's finite sample performance is assessed via Monte Carlo simulations. We apply the methodology to nowcasting U.S. GDP growth and demonstrate that it outperforms both sparse regression and standard factor-augmented regression during the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure the robustness of these results, we also implement factor-augmented sparse logistic regression, which further confirms the superior accuracy of our nowcast probabilities during recessions. These findings indicate that recessions are influenced by both idiosyncratic (sparse) and common (dense) shocks.</description>
