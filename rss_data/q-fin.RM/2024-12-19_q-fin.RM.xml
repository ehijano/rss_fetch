      <title>Explainable Risk Classification in Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every publicly traded company in the US is required to file an annual 10-K financial report, which contains a wealth of information about the company. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep-learning model, called FinBERT-XRC, that takes a 10-K report as input, and automatically assesses the post-event return volatility risk of its associated company. In contrast to previous systems, our proposed model simultaneously offers explanations of its classification decision at three different levels: the word, sentence, and corpus levels. By doing so, our model provides a comprehensive interpretation of its prediction to end users. This is particularly important in financial domains, where the transparency and accountability of algorithmic predictions play a vital role in their application to decision-making processes. Aside from its novel interpretability, our model surpasses the state of the art in predictive accuracy in experiments on a large real-world dataset of 10-K reports spanning six years.</description>

      <title>Climate-Driven Doubling of U.S. Maize Loss Probability: Interactive Simulation with Neural Network Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change not only threatens agricultural producers but also strains related public agencies and financial institutions. These important food system actors include government entities tasked with insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. We examine future risk within the U.S. Corn Belt geographic region for one such crucial institution: the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program. Specifically, we predict the impacts of climate-driven crop loss at a policy-salient "risk unit" scale. Built through our presented neural network Monte Carlo method, simulations anticipate both more frequent and more severe losses that would result in a costly doubling of the annual probability of maize Yield Protection insurance claims at mid-century. We also provide an open source pipeline and interactive visualization tools to explore these results with configurable statistical treatments. Altogether, we fill an important gap in current understanding for climate adaptation by bridging existing historic yield estimation and climate projection to predict crop loss metrics at policy-relevant granularity.</description>
