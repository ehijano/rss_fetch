      <title>Bounds on Maximum Lee Distance Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upper bounds on the minimum Lee distance of codes that are linear over $\mathbb{Z}_q$ are discussed. The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the length, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are referred to as Maximum Lee Distance (MLD) Codes. We present some new bounds, proved using combinatorial arguments. The new bounds provide improvements over those in the literature.</description>

      <title>Realizability of hypergraphs and high-dimensional contingency tables with random degrees and marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Deza, Levin, Meesum, and Onn shows that the problem of deciding if a given sequence is the degree sequence of a 3-uniform hypergraph is NP complete. We tackle this problem in the random case and show that a random integer partition can be realized as the degree sequence of a $3$-uniform hypergraph with high probability. These results are in stark contrast with the case of graphs, where a classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai provides an efficient algorithm for checking if a sequence is a degree sequence of a graph and a result of Pittel shows that with high probability a random partition is not the degree sequence of a graph.
  By the same method, we address analogous realizability problems about high-dimensional binary contingency tables. We prove that if $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ are three independent random partitions then with high probability one can construct a three-dimensional binary contingency table with marginals $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$. Conversely, if one insists that the contingency table forms a pyramid shape, then we show that with high probability one cannot construct such a contingency table. These two results confirm two conjectures of Pak and Panova.</description>

      <title>Dimer face polynomials in knot theory and cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of perfect matchings of a connected bipartite plane graph $G$ has the structure of a distributive lattice, as shown by Propp, where the partial order is induced by the \emph{height} of a matching. In this article, our focus is the \emph{dimer face polynomial} of $G$, which is the height generating function of all perfect matchings of $G$. We connect the dimer face polynomial on the one hand to knot theory, and on the other to cluster algebras. We show that certain dimer face polynomials are multivariate generalizations of Alexander polynomials of links, highlighting another combinatorial view of the Alexander polynomial. We also show that an arbitrary dimer face polynomial is an $F$-polynomial in the cluster algebra whose initial quiver is dual to the graph $G$. As a result, we recover a recent representation theoretic result of Bazier-Matte and Schiffler that connects $F$-polynomials and Alexander polynomials, albeit from a very different, dimer-based perspective. As another application of our results, we also show that all nonvanishing Pl\"ucker coordinates on open positroid varieties are cluster monomials.</description>

      <title>On supratopologies, normalized families and Frankl conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce some generalized topological concepts to deal with union-closed families, and show that one can reduce the proof of Frankl conjecture to some families of so-called supratopological spaces. We prove some results on the structure of normalized families, presenting a new way of reducing such a family to a smaller one using dual families. Applying our reduction method, we prove a refinement of a conjecture originally proposed by Poonen. Finally, we show that Frankl Conjecture holds for the class of families obtained from successively applying the reduction process to a power set.</description>

      <title>Large sum-free sets in finite vector spaces I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number with $p\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ and let $n\ge 1$ be a dimension. It is known that a sum-free subset of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ can have at most the size $\frac13(p+1)p^{n-1}$ and that, up to automorphisms of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$, the only extremal example is the `cuboid' $\bigl[\frac{p+1}3, \frac{2p-1}3\bigr]\times {\mathbb F}_p^{n-1}$.
  For $p\ge 11$ we show that if a sum-free subset of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ is not contained in such an extremal one, then its size is at most $\frac13(p-2)p^{n-1}$. This bound is optimal and we classify the extremal configurations. The remaining cases $p=2, 5$ are known to behave differently. For $p=3$ the analogous question was solved by Vsevolod Lev, and for $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ it is less interesting.</description>

      <title>The nucleus of a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph with diameter $D\geq 1$. For a vertex $x$ of $\Gamma$ the corresponding subconstituent algebra $T=T(x)$ is generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $\Gamma$ and the dual adjacency matrix $A^*=A^*(x)$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We introduce a $T$-module $\mathcal N = \mathcal N(x)$ called the nucleus of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We describe $\mathcal N$ from various points of view. We show that all the irreducible $T$-submodules of $\mathcal N$ are thin. Under the assumption that $\Gamma$ is a nonbipartite dual polar graph, we give an explicit basis for $\mathcal N$ and the action of $A, A^*$ on this basis. The basis is in bijection with the set of elements for the projective geometry $L_D(q)$, where $GF(q)$ is the finite field used to define $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $H$ is not a subgraph of $G$ but $H$ is a subgraph of $G + e$ for any edge $e$ in $\overline{G}$. The saturation number $sat(n,H)$ for a graph $H$ is the minimal number of edges in any $H$-saturated graph of order $n$. The $sat(n, K_{p_1} \cup K_{p_2} \cup K_{p_3})$ with $p_3 \ge p_1 + p_2$ was given in [Discrete Math. 347 (2024) 113868]. In this paper, $sat(n,K_{p_1} \cup K_{p_2} \cup K_{p_3} \cup K_{p_4})$ with $p_{i+1} - p_i \ge p_1$ for $2 \le i\le 3$ and $4\le p_1\le p_2$ is determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper gives some multi-dimensional extensions of Hindman's finite sum theorem. In particular, by the method of this paper, we prove that for any finite coloring of $\mathbb N$, there are $a,b\in \mathbb N$ such that there exist (infinitely many) pairs $(x,y),(u,v)\in \mathbb N^2$ such that the two sets $\{ax,ay,xy,a(x+y)\}$ and $\{u+b,v+b,uv+b,u+v\}$ are monochromatic.</description>

      <title>Limit shapes and fluctuations for $(GL_n, GL_k)$ skew Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the probability measures on Young diagrams in the $n \times k$ rectangle obtained by piecewise-continuously differentiable specializations of Schur polynomials in the dual Cauchy identity. We use a free fermionic representation of the correlation kernel to study its asymptotic behavior and derive the uniform convergence to a limit shape of Young diagrams in the limit $n,k \to \infty$. More specifically, we show the bulk is the discrete sine kernel with boundary fluctuations generically given by the Tracy-Widom distribution with the Airy kernel. When our limit shape touches the boundary corner of the rectangle, the fluctuations with a second order correction are given by the discrete Hermite kernel, and we recover the discrete distribution of Gravner-Tracy-Widom (2001) [arXiv:math/0005133] restricting to the leading order. Finally, we demonstrate our limit shapes can have sections with no or full density of particles, where the Pearcey kernel appears when such a section is infinitely small.</description>

      <title>Fixation of leadership in non-Markovian growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a model where $N$ equal agents possess `values', belonging to $\mathbb{N}_0$, that are subject to incremental growth over time. More precisely, the values of the agents are represented by $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$ valued processes with random, independent waiting times between jumps. We show that the event that a single agent possesses the maximum value for all sufficiently large values of time (called `leadership') occurs with probability zero or one, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur. Under mild conditions we also provide criteria for a single agent to become the unique agent of maximum value for all sufficiently large times, and also conditions for the emergence of a unique agent having value that tends to infinity before `explosion' occurs (i.e. conditions for `strict leadership' or `monopoly' to occur almost surely). The novelty of this model lies in allowing non-exponentially distributed waiting times between jumps in value. In the particular case when waiting times are mixtures of exponential distributions, we improve a well-established result on the `balls in bins' model with feedback, removing the requirement that the feedback function be bounded from below and also allowing random feedback functions. As part of the proofs we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution of a convergent series of independent random variables to have an atom on the real line, a result which we believe may be of interest in its own right.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Common graphs with arbitrary chromatic number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05800v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey's Theorem guarantees for every graph H that any 2-edge-coloring of a sufficiently large complete graph contains a monochromatic copy of H. In 1962, Erdos conjectured that the random 2-edge-coloring minimizes the number of monochromatic copies of K_k, and the conjecture was extended by Burr and Rosta to all graphs. In the late 1980s, the conjectures were disproved by Thomason and Sidorenko, respectively. A classification of graphs whose number of monochromatic copies is minimized by the random 2-edge-coloring, which are referred to as common graphs, remains a challenging open problem. If Sidorenko's Conjecture, one of the most significant open problems in extremal graph theory, is true, then every 2-chromatic graph is common, and in fact, no 2-chromatic common graph unsettled for Sidorenko's Conjecture is known. While examples of 3-chromatic common graphs were known for a long time, the existence of a 4-chromatic common graph was open until 2012, and no common graph with a larger chromatic number is known.
  We construct connected k-chromatic common graphs for every k. This answers a question posed by Hatami, Hladky, Kral, Norine and Razborov [Combin. Probab. Comput. 21 (2012), 734-742], and a problem listed by Conlon, Fox and Sudakov [London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser. 424 (2015), 49-118, Problem 2.28]. This also answers in a stronger form the question raised by Jagger, Stovicek and Thomason [Combinatorica 16, (1996), 123-131] whether there exists a common graph with chromatic number at least four.</description>

Abstract: Let $R(C_n)$ be the Ramsey number of the cycle on $n$ vertices. We prove that, for some $C &gt; 0$, with high probability every $2$-colouring of the edges of $G(N,p)$ has a monochromatic copy of $C_n$, as long as $N\geq R(C_n) + C/p$ and $p \geq C/n$. This is sharp up to the value of $C$ and it improves results of Letzter and of Krivelevich, Kronenberg and Mond.</description>

Abstract: Metric trees and metric tree arrangements index cones in the polyhedral fan structure in the Dressian $Dr(2,n)$ and $Dr(3,n)$ respectively. We introduce the notion of generalized metric tree arrangements which parameterize points in $Dr(k,n)$ and extend previously known results to $Dr(k,n)$ along with providing explicit examples of these generalized metric tree arrangements. We study the adjacency of cones in the positive Dressian $Dr_{&gt;0}(3, n)$ and introduce generalized Whitehead moves which provide a condition for adjacency of maximal cones in $Dr_{&gt;0}(3,n)$ in terms of the associated metric tree arrangements.</description>

      <title>Abundance of arithmetic progressions in $\mathcal{CR}$-sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: H.Furstenberg and E.Glasner proved that for an arbitrary $k\in\mathbb{N}$, any piecewise syndetic set of integers contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression and the collection of such progressions is itself piecewise syndetic in $\mathbb{Z}.$ The above result was extended for arbitrary semigroups by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman, using the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups. However, they provided an abundance for various types of large sets. In \cite{DHS}, the first author, Neil Hindman and Dona Strauss introduced two notions of large sets, namely, $J$-set and $C$-set. In \cite{BG}, V. Bergelson and D. Glasscock introduced another notion of largeness, which is analogous to the notion of $J$-set, namely $\mathcal{CR}$- set. All these sets contain arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length. In \cite{DG}, the second author and S. Goswami proved that for any $J$-set, $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, the collection $\{(a,b):\,\{a,a+b,a+2b,\ldots,a+lb\}\subset A\}$ is a $J$-set in $(\mathbb{N\times\mathbb{N}},+)$. In this article, we prove the same for $\mathcal{CR}$-sets.</description>

Abstract: Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that every graph $G$ with $\Delta\ge9$ satisfies $\chi\le$ max $\{\omega, \Delta-1\}$. Gupta and Pradhan proved the Borodin-Kostochka conjecture for ($P_5$, $C_4$)-free graphs. In this note, we prove the Borodin-Kostochka conjecture for ($P_6$, apple, torch)-free graphs, that is, graphs with no induced $P_6$, no induced $C_5$ with a hanging edge, and no induced $C_5$ and $C_4$ sharing exactly two edges. This generalizes the result of Gupta and Pradhan from the perspective of allowing the existence of $P_5$.</description>

      <title>Borel Vizing's Theorem for Graphs of Subexponential Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every Borel graph $G$ of subexponential growth has a Borel proper edge-coloring with $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors. We deduce this from a stronger result, namely that an $n$-vertex (finite) graph $G$ of subexponential growth can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors by an $O(\log^\ast n)$-round deterministic distributed algorithm in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model, where the implied constants in the $O(\cdot)$ notation are determined by a bound on the growth rate of $G$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity and related properties in $K_{r+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove best-possible edge density conditions sufficient to guarantee traceability, Hamiltonicity, chorded pancyclicity, Hamiltonian-connectedness, $k$-path Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonian-connectedness, and $k$-connectedness in $K_{r+1}$-free graphs. We characterize the extremal graphs. Then we extend these edge density conditions to clique density conditions. Equivalently, we introduce variants of the extremal number ex$(n,F)$ and the generalized extremal number ex$(n,H,F)$ -- that is, the maximum numbers of edges and copies of $H$, respectively, in $n$-vertex, $F$-free graphs -- in which we require that these graphs not be traceable, Hamiltonian, chorded pancyclic, Hamiltonian-connected, $k$-path Hamiltonian, $k$-Hamiltonian, $k$-Hamiltonian-connected, or $k$-connected, and we determine their values for $F=K_{r+1}$ and $H=K_t$.</description>

      <title>On the length of directed paths in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomass\'{e} conjectured the following strengthening of the well-known Caccetta-Haggkvist Conjecture: any digraph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ and girth $g$ contains a directed path of length $\delta(g-1)$. Bai and Manoussakis \cite{Bai} gave counterexamples to Thomass\'{e}'s conjecture for every even $g\geq 4$. In this note, we first generalize their counterexamples to show that Thomass\'{e}'s conjecture is false for every $g\geq 4$. We also obtain the positive result that any digraph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ and girth $g$ contains a directed path of $2(1-\frac{2}{g})$. For small $g$ we obtain better bounds, e.g.~for $g=3$ we show that oriented graph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ contains a directed path of length $1.5\delta$. Furthermore, we show that each $d$-regular digraph with girth $g$ contains a directed path of length $\Omega(dg/\log d)$. Our results give the first non-trivial bounds for these problems.</description>

      <title>Extremes of generalized inversions on permutation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized inversions $X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d)}$ and generalized descents $X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d)}$ are an interesting combinatorial extension of the common inversion and descent statistics. By means of the root poset, they can be defined on all classical Weyl groups. In this paper, we investigate the bivariate normality of $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d)}, X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d)})^\top$ as well as the extreme value behavior of $X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d_1)}$, $X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d_2)}$ and $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d_1)}, X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d_2)})^\top$. We show that bivariate normality holds in the regimes of $d_1 = o(n^{1/3})$ and $d_1 = \omega(n^{1/2})$. For these situations, we also discuss the number of samples $k_n$ for which the Gumbel max-attraction applies to a triangular array based on $X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d_1)}$, $X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d_2)}$ or $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}^{(d_1)}, X_{\mathrm{des}}^{(d_2)})^\top$.</description>

      <title>Half-space separation in monophonic convexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study half-space separation in the convexity of chordless paths of a graph, i.e., monophonic convexity. In this problem, one is given a graph and two (disjoint) subsets of vertices and asks whether these two sets can be separated by complementary convex sets, called half-spaces. While it is known this problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete for geodesic convexity -- the convexity of shortest paths -- we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for monophonic convexity.</description>

      <title>Fully graphic degree sequences and P-stable degree sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of $P$-stability of an infinite set of degree sequences plays influential role in approximating the permanents, rapidly sampling the realizations of graphic degree sequences, or even studying and improving network privacy. While there exist several known sufficient conditions for $P$-stability, we don't know any useful necessary condition for it. We also do not have good insight of possible structure of $P$-stable degree sequence families.
  At first we will show that every known infinite $P$-stable degree sequence set, described by inequalities of the parameters $n, c_1, c_2, \Sigma$ (the sequence length, the maximum and minimum degrees and the sum of the degrees) is ,,fully graphic" meaning that every degree sequence from the region with an even degree sum, is graphic. Furthermore, if $\Sigma$ does not occur in the determining inequality, then the notions of $P$-stability and full graphicality will be proved equivalent. In turns, this equality provides a strengthening of the well-known theorem of Jerrum, McKay and Sinclair about $P$-stability, describing the maximal $P$-stable sequence set by $n, c_1, c_2$. Furthermore we conjecture that similar equivalences occur in cases if $\Sigma$ also part of the defining inequality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wolstenholme's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wolstenholme's type summations involve certain powers of all residues $k$ modulo some prime number $p$. We first consider the sums of double or triple products of certain powers of all residues, e.g., the sums of the terms $(a+k)^m(b+k)^n$ or $(a+k)^m(b+k)^n(c+k)^s$ as $k$ ranges over all residues modulo $p$. We consider the sums of double or triple ratios of such terms. We showed that each of such sums is congruent to some simpler expression involving certain binomial coefficients. We also generalize these results to the sums of products or ratios of arbitrary $n$ terms: $(a_1+k)^{m_1}$, ..., $(a_n+k)^{m_n}$. We relate such summations to the sum of certain coefficients of polynomials of type $(a_1-a_n+x)^{m_1} \cdots (a_{n-1}-a_n+x)^{m_{n-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Sandpiles on the Vicsek fractal explode with probability 1/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vicsek fractal graphs are an important class of infinite graphs with self similar properties, polynomial growth and treelike features, on which several dynamical processes such as random walks or Abelian sandpiles can be rigorously analyzed and one can obtain explicit closed form expressions. While such processes on Vicsek fractals and on Euclidean lattices $\mathbb{Z}^2$ share some properties for instance in the recurrence behaviour, many quantities related to sandpiles on Euclidean lattices are still poorly understood. The current work focuses on the stabilization and explosion of Abelian sandpiles on Vicsek fractal graphs, and we prove that a sandpile sampled from the infinite volume limit plus one additional particle stabilizes with probability 3/4, that is, it does not stabilize almost surely and it explodes with the complementary probability 1/4. We prove the main result by using two different approaches: one of probabilistic nature and one of algebraic flavor. The first approach is based on investigating the particles sent to the boundary of finite volumes and showing that their number stays above four with positive probability. In the second approach we relate the question of stabilization and explosion of sandpiles in infinite volume to the order of elements of the sandpile group on finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek graph. The method applies to more general state spaces and by employing it we also find all invariant factors of the sandpile groups on the finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek fractal.</description>

      <title>On $[1,2]$-Domination in Interval and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a Dominating Set if each vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called a $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum $[1,j]$-dominating set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has a $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard for split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set on interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.</description>
