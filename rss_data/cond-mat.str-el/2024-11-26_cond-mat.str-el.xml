      <title>Forestalled Phase Separation as the Precursor to Stripe Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripe order is a prominent feature in the phase diagram of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors and has been confirmed as the ground state of the two-dimensional Fermi Hubbard model in certain parameter regimes. Upon increasing the temperature, stripes and the superconducting state give way to the enigmatic strange metal and pseudogap regime, whose precise nature poses long-standing, unresolved puzzles. Using modern tensor network techniques, we discover a crucial aspect of these regimes. Infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) simulations in the fully two-dimensional limit reveal a maximum in the charge susceptibility at temperatures above the stripe phase. This maximum is located around hole-doping $p=1/8$ and intensifies upon cooling. Using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) simulations on finite cylinders, we attribute the enhanced charge susceptibility to the formation of charge clusters, reminiscent of phase separation where the system is partitioned into hole-rich and hole-depleted regions. In contrast to genuine phase separation, the charge cluster sizes fluctuate statistically without a divergent charge susceptibility. Hence, while this precursor state features clustering of charge carriers, true phase separation is ultimately forestalled at lower temperatures by the onset of stripe order.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at temperatures in the quantum critical regime of other spin liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of the dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of single crystals of the ruthenium-dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ using magnetic susceptibility and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements. While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.</description>

      <title>Charge gain via solid-state gating of an oxide Mott system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modulation of channel conductance in field-effect transistors (FETs) via metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has revolutionized information processing and storage. However, the limitations of silicon-based FETs in electrical switching have driven the search for new materials capable of overcoming these constraints. Electrostatic gating of competing electronic phases in a Mott material near its metal to insulator transition (MIT) offers prospects of substantial modulation of the free carriers and electrical resistivity through small changes in band filling. While electrostatic control of the MIT has been previously reported, the advancement of Mott materials towards novel Mott transistors requires the realization of their charge gain prospects in a solid-state device. In this study, we present gate-control of electron correlation using a solid-state device utilizing the oxide Mott system $La_{1-x}Sr_xVO_3$ as a correlated FET channel. We report on a gate resistance response that cannot be explained in a purely electrostatic framework, suggesting at least $\times100$ charge gain originating from the correlated behavior. These preliminary results pave the way towards the development of highly efficient, low-power electronic devices that could surpass the performance bottlenecks of conventional FETs by leveraging the electronic phase transitions of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>The Hund-metal path to strong electronic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic physics has a profound impact on the physical properties of correlated electron materials. This article describes a prime example of this phenomenon. We provide a non-technical introduction to the physics of Hund metals, a broad class of materials which include in particular iron pnictides and chalcogenides, as well as oxides of the 4d transition-metal series such as ruthenates. We highlight experiments which reveal distinctive signatures of Hund physics in selected materials. A key property of Hund metals is a clear separation between the energy and temperature scales associated with spin and orbital degrees of freedom. We emphasize the conceptual and practical importance of the non-perturbative renormalization group flow which identifies the relevant degrees of freedom at each energy scale. The flow begins with local atomic degrees of freedom at high energy, displays a universal behavior in the intermediate regime of spin-orbital separation and ends into a broad diversity of possible ordered phases. Ordering can take place either as an instability of the Fermi liquid regime with coherent quasiparticles or directly from the intermediate regime before Fermi liquid quasiparticles had a chance to emerge. Dynamical mean-field theory provides a natural conceptual framework as well as a powerful computational method to explain, calculate and predict many physical properties of correlated materials such as Hund metals.

      <title>Spin amplitude wave due to dipole-quadrupole hybridization in spin-1 pyrochlore magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantum $S=1$ pyrochlore magnet featuring Fe$^{2+}$ based spinel oxides that addresses the formation of amplitude-modulated spin-density waves. We propose that the relatively small spin-orbit coupling and the small extra crystal field splitting in these materials create anisotropic exchange interactions and strong single-ion anisotropy, respectively, whose interplay becomes the source of quadrupolar moments selectively condensing on certain sublattices, leading to a spatially modulated hybrid of dipolar and quadrupolar order. This mechanism represents the possibility of insulating magnets to form an exotic phase with coexisting liquid-solid properties.</description>

      <title>Origin of the transitions inversion in rare-earth vanadates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising inversion of the orbital- and magnetic-order transition temperatures in the RVO3 series with increasing the rare-earth radius makes the series unique among orbitally-ordered materials. Here, augmenting dynamical mean-field theory with a decomposition of the order parameter into irreducible tensors, we show that this anomalous behavior emerges from an unusual hierarchy of interactions. First, increasing the rare-earth radius, orbital physics comes to be controlled by xz-xz quadrupolar super-exchange rather than by lattice distortion. Next, for antiferromagnetic spin order, orbital super-exchange terms with different spin rank compete, so that the dipolar spin-spin interaction dominates. Eventually, G-type magnetic order (anti-ferro in all directions) can appear already above the orbital ordering transition, and C-type order (anti-ferro in the ab plane) right around it. The strict constraints we found explain why the inversion is rare, giving at the same time criteria to look for similar behavior in other materials.</description>

      <title>Emerging new phases in correlated Mott insulator Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 is a paradigmatic example among transition metal oxides, where the interplay of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom leads to competing quantum phases. In this paper, we focus on and review some key aspects, from the underlying physical framework and its basic properties, to recent theoretical efforts that aim to trigger unconventional quantum ground states, using several external parameters and stimuli. Using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that Ca2RuO4 shows a spin splitting in the reciprocal space, and identify it as an altermagnetic candidate material. The non relativistic spin-splitting has an orbital selective nature, dictated by the local crystallographic symmetry. Next, we consider two routes that may trigger exotic quantum states. The first one corresponds to transition metal substitution of the 4d4 Ru with isovalent 3d3 ions. This substitutional doping may alter the spin-orbital correlations favoring the emergence of negative thermal expansion. The second route explores fledgling states arising in a nonequilibrium steady state under the influence of an applied electric field. We show that the electric field can directly affect the orbital density, eventually leading to strong orbital fluctuations and the suppression of orbital imbalance, which may, in turn, reduce antiferromagnetism. These aspects suggest possible practical applications, as its unique properties may open up possibilities for augmenting existing technologies, surpassing the limitations of conventional materials.</description>

      <title>Unusual Coulomb phase physics in the arctic square ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square ice is a two-dimensional spin liquid hosting a Coulomb phase physics. When constrained under specific boundary conditions, the so-called domain-wall boundary conditions, a phase separation occurs that leads to the formation of a spin liquid confined within a disk surrounded by magnetically ordered regions. Here, we numerically characterize the ground-state properties of this spin liquid, coined the arctic square ice in reference to a phenomenon known in statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that both the vertex distributions and the magnetic correlations are inhomogeneous within the liquid region, and they exhibit a radial dependence. If these properties resemble those of the conventional square ice close to the center of the disk, they evolve continuously as the disk perimeter is approached. There, the spin liquid orders. As a result, pinch points, signaling the presence of algebraic spin correlations, coexist with magnetic Bragg peaks in the magnetic structure factor computed within the disk. The arctic square ice thus appears as an unconventional Coulomb phase sharing common features with a fragmented spin liquid, albeit on a charge-neutral vacuum.</description>

      <title>Square ice Coulomb phase as a percolated vertex lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square ice is a canonical example of a Coulomb phase in two dimensions: Its ground state is extensively degenerate and satisfies a local constraint on the spin arrangement (the so-called ice rule). In this paper, we use a loop flip algorithm to explore the properties of this ground state that we analyze not in terms of a spin texture, but rather in terms of a spatial distribution of ice-rule satisfying vertices. More specifically, we determine for various lattice sizes the average vertex populations characterizing the ice manifold, the pairwise vertex correlations, and the size distribution of vertex clusters. Comparing these results to those obtained from random, constraint-free vertex tilings, the square ice manifold is found to resemble an almost ideal vertex gas, and the cluster size distribution of ice-rule satisfying vertices is well approximated by percolation theory. Remarkably, this description remains reasonably accurate when monopoles are present in a dilute amount, allowing a direct comparison with experiments. Revising former experimental results on two artificial square ice systems, we illustrate the interest of our approach to spot the presence of a Coulomb phase from a vertex analysis.</description>

      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the 3d Ising Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings are systematically tuned.</description>

      <title>Large tuning of the optical properties of nanoscale NdNiO3 via electron doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesized crystalline films of neodymium nickel oxide (NdNiO3), a perovskite quantum material, switched the films from a metal phase (intrinsic) into an insulator phase (electron-doped) by field-driven lithium-ion intercalation, and characterized their structural and optical properties. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.</description>

      <title>Fourfold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Unconventional Critical Exponents in Twinned FePd$_2$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a special material symmetry operation, crystal twins usually influence physical properties. Here, detailed electrical transport and magnetic measurements were performed to reveal twinning effect on properties of van der Waals ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. Orthorhombic crystal domains were observed in polarized optical microscopy and fixed $\pi$/2 angle between adjacent domains suggests a phase transition origin of the twins. FePd$_2$Te$_2$ exhibits fourfold in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance. It is attributed to antiferromagnetic coupling component near atomically flat twin boundary and pseudo four-fold symmetry from perpendicular Fe chains. Intense magnetic domain motion is suggested by Hopkinson effect observed in magnetic susceptibility. A set of unusual critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.866, $\gamma$ = 1.043, $\delta$ = 2.20 cannot be classified in any universal class predicted by renormalized group. Deviation from standard model reflects the non-saturating magnetization and slow growth of spontaneous magnetization resulting from crystal domain walls. These results show that additional symmetry from twins and twin boundary have a significant effect on electrical transport and magnetic properties of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. There is much room to modulate physical properties of twinned van der Waals ferromagnets through twins.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the usual color code paradigm corresponding to an $n$-fold cup product, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries and apply it to construct addressable logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories including a non-hydrodynamic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in 2d CFT: reflected entropy, RG flow, and information velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time evolution of entanglement entropy in generic chaotic many-body systems has an effective description in terms of a minimal membrane, characterised by a tension function. For 2d CFTs, a degenerate tension function reproduces several results regarding the dynamics of the entropy; this stands in contrast to higher dimensions where the tension is non-degenerate. In this paper we use holography to show that, in order to correctly capture the reflected entropy in 2d CFT, one needs to add an additional degree of freedom to the membrane description. Furthermore, we show that the conventional non-degenerate membrane tension function emerges upon introducing a relevant deformation of the CFT, dual to a planar BTZ black hole with scalar hair and with an interior Kasner universe. Finally, we also study the membrane description for reflected entropy and information velocity arXiv:1908.06993 in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement without local addressing via spiral quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable measurements in various bases. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the "spin-spiral" structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, in various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Unusual Temperature Dependence of the Upper Critical Field of Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5: Multiple Bands or van Hove Singularities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries in singularity-free nonlinear $\sigma$ models and their disordered phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear $\sigma$-model in ${(d+1)}$-dimensional spacetime with connected target space $K$ and show that, at energy scales below singular field configurations (such as vortices), it has an emergent non-invertible higher symmetry. The symmetry defects of the emergent symmetry are described by the $d$-representations of a discrete $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ (i.e. the emergent symmetry is the dual of the invertible $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ symmetry). The $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is determined such that its classifying space $B\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is given by the $d$-th Postnikov stage of $K$. In $(2+1)$D and for finite $\mathbb{G}^{(2)}$, this symmetry is always holo-equivalent to an invertible ${0}$-form (ordinary) symmetry with potential 't Hooft anomaly. The singularity-free disordered phase of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model spontaneously breaks this symmetry, and when $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is finite, it is described by the deconfined phase of $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ higher gauge theory. We consider examples of such disordered phases. We focus on a singularity-free $S^2$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model in ${(3+1)}$D and show that it has an emergent non-invertible higher symmetry. As a result, its disordered phase is described by axion electrodynamics and has two gapless modes corresponding to a photon and a massless axion. Notably, this non-perturbative result is different from the results obtained using the $S^N$ and $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ nonlinear $\sigma$-models in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the Euclidean time operator growth dynamics at infinite temperature. Crucially, our approach is free from the numerical sign problem for a broad family of quantum many-body spin systems, allowing for numerically exact and unbiased calculations. We apply this methodological headway to study the high-frequency dynamics of the mixed-field quantum Ising model (QIM) in one and two dimensions. The resulting quantum dynamics display rapid thermalization, supporting the recently proposed operator growth hypothesis. Physically, our findings correspond to an exponential fall-off of generic response functions of local correlators at large frequencies. Remarkably, our calculations are sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle logarithmic corrections of the hypothesis in one dimension. In addition, in two dimensions, we uncover a non-trivial dynamical crossover between two large frequency decay rates. Lastly, we reveal spatio-temporal scaling laws associated with operator growth, which are found to be strongly affected by boundary contributions.</description>

Abstract: We highlight the exotic quantum criticality of quasi-two-dimensional single-component fermions at half-filling that are minimally coupled to a dynamical Ising gauge theory. With the numerical matrix product state based infinite density matrix renormalization group method, we discover a robust quantum critical line in the infinite cylinder geometry, where gauge confinement and dimerized translation symmetry breaking emerge simultaneously. We investigate how the transition can be split by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered dimerized phase that is stabilized by additional short-range repulsive interactions. We conjecture a $u(1)$ deconfined criticality scenario, propose a corresponding low-energy effective field theory of the exotic quantum critical point in the two-dimensional limit and identify its shortcomings</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale tracking of topological defect motion and incommensurate charge order melting</title>

Abstract: Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of quantum materials where it competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily stabilized in manganese oxides where it is associated with anomalous electronic and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates precise characterization and understanding of its relationship with competing phases. Leveraging atomic-resolution variable temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order as it transforms from its ground state in a model manganite system. We find that mobile networks of discommensurations and dislocations generate phase inhomogeneity and induce global incommensurability in an otherwise lattice-locked modulation. Driving the order to melt at high temperatures, the discommensuration density grows and regions of order locally decouple from the lattice periodicity.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Ginzburg-Landau theory for commensurate pair density wave (PDW) states in a hexagonal lattice system, relevant to the kagome superconductors $\rm{AV_3Sb_5}$. Compared to previous theoretical frameworks, the commensurate wave vectors permit additional symmetric terms in the free energy, altering the system's ground state and its degeneracy. In particular, we analyze topological defects in the energetically favorable $\psi_{\text{kagome}}$ ground state and find that kinks on domain walls can carry $1/3$ topological charges. We further establish a correspondence between the SC fluctuations in these states and an effective $J_1-J_2$ frustrated XY model on the emergent kagome lattice. By employing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the existence of a vestigial phase characterized by $1/3$ vortex-antivortex pairs in low temperatures with the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magnetoresistance oscillations observed in recent experiments [J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Impact of electron correlations on two-particle charge response in electron- and hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating many-body effects that deviate from an independent particle approach, has long been a key research interest in condensed matter physics. Layered cuprates are prototypical systems, where electron-electron interactions are found to strongly affect the dynamics of single-particle excitations. It is however, still unclear how the electron correlations influence charge excitations, such as plasmons, which have been variously treated with either weak or strong correlation models. In this work, we demonstrate the hybridised nature of collective valence charge fluctuations leading to dispersing acoustic-like plasmons in hole-doped La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_{4}$ and electron-doped La$_{1.84}$Ce$_{0.16}$CuO$_{4}$ using the two-particle probe, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We then describe the plasmon dispersions in both systems, within both the weak mean-field Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and strong coupling $t$-$J$-$V$ models. The $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the correlation effects implicitly, accurately describes the plasmon dispersions as resonant excitations outside the single-particle intra-band continuum. In comparison, a quantitative description of the plasmon dispersion in the RPA approach is obtained only upon explicit consideration of re-normalized electronic band parameters. Our comparative analysis shows that electron correlations significantly impact the low-energy plasmon excitations across the cuprate doping phase diagram, even at long wavelengths. Thus, complementary information on the evolution of electron correlations, influenced by the rich electronic phases in condensed matter systems, can be extracted through the study of two-particle charge response.</description>

      <title>Gapless dispersive continuum in a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems exhibit a diverse set of phenomena but are more challenging to simulate than their equilibrium counterparts. Here, we introduce the Quantum High-Frequency Floquet Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method to simulate fast-driven quantum systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows prior methods for time-independent simulation to be lifted to simulate Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model, a natural test bed for quantum frustrated magnetism and criticality, as a case study to illustrate our algorithm. We implemented a 20-qubit simulation of the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum computer. Our error analysis shows that QHiFFS exhibits not only a cubic advantage in driving frequency $\omega$ but also a linear advantage in simulation time $t$ compared to~Trotterization.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero mode in a quantum computer from a duality twist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host atopological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $Z_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of Majorana bound states with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either phase and momentum relaxation or phase relaxation is present. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana cases.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Linear Spin-Wave Theory in a Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the spin-wave theory of the excitation spectrum and quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model. The complex excitation spectrum is obtained for a generic hypercubic lattice using the linear approximation of the Holstein-Primakoff transformation together with the complex bosonic Bogolyubov transformation. In the one-dimensional case, our result compares very well with the exact quasiparticle dispersion relation obtained via a fermionic representation of the problem, at least in the regime of large dissipation and transverse field. When applied to the quench dynamics we show however that the linear spin-wave approximation breaks down and the bosonic theory is plagued by a divergence at finite times. We understand the origin of this instability using a single mode approximation. While limited to short times, we show that this approach allows us to characterize the dynamics arising from the quench of the dissipative term and the structure of the Lieb-Robinson light-cone of the propagation quantum correlations. Furthermore, for the one-dimensional case, the linear spin-wave dynamics shows good agreement with the exact fermionic solution, both for the local magnetization and the spin-spin correlations.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by a superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18701</link>

Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Carlo.jl: A general framework for Monte Carlo simulations in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carlo is a Monte Carlo simulation framework written in Julia. It provides MPI-parallel scheduling, organized storage of input, checkpoint, and output files, as well as statistical postprocessing. With a minimalist design, it aims to aid the development of high-quality Monte Carlo codes, especially for demanding applications in condensed matter and statistical physics. This hands-on user guide shows how to implement a simple code with Carlo and provides benchmarks to show its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket {likely} originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>Holographic zero sound for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs in 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build up the notion of metallic holography for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs in four dimensions, in the presence of a finite $U(1)$ chemical potential. We compute two point correlation functions and study their properties in the regime of low frequency and low momentum. The color sector reveals gapless excitations, one of which propagates with a finite phase velocity while the other mode attenuates through scattering. The flavour sector, on the other hand, reveals spectrum that contains quasiparticle excitations which propagate with a definite phase velocity together with modes that propagate with a finite group velocity which quantum attenuates quite similar in spirit as that of Landau's zero sound modes. We also compute associated AC conductivities, which exhibit different characteristics for different (color and flavour) sectors of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>
