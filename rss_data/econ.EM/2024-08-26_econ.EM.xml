      <title>Machine Learning and the Yield Curve: Tree-Based Macroeconomic Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore tree-based macroeconomic regime-switching in the context of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) yield-curve model. In particular, we customize the tree-growing algorithm to partition macroeconomic variables based on the DNS model's marginal likelihood, thereby identifying regime-shifting patterns in the yield curve. Compared to traditional Markov-switching models, our model offers clear economic interpretation via macroeconomic linkages and ensures computational simplicity. In an empirical application to U.S. Treasury bond yields, we find (1) important yield curve regime switching, and (2) evidence that macroeconomic variables have predictive power for the yield curve when the short rate is high, but not in other regimes, thereby refining the notion of yield curve ``macro-spanning".</description>

      <title>Difference-in-differences with as few as two cross-sectional units -- A new perspective to the democracy-growth debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pooled panel analyses tend to mask heterogeneity in unit-specific treatment effects. For example, existing studies on the impact of democracy on economic growth do not reach a consensus as empirical findings are substantially heterogeneous in the country composition of the panel. In contrast to pooled panel analyses, this paper proposes a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator that exploits the temporal dimension in the data and estimates unit-specific average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) with as few as two cross-sectional units. Under weak identification and temporal dependence conditions, the DiD estimator is asymptotically normal. The estimator is further complemented with a test of identification granted at least two candidate control units. Empirical results using the DiD estimator suggest Benin's economy would have been 6.3% smaller on average over the 1993-2018 period had she not democratised.</description>

      <title>Extended MinP Tests for Global and Multiple testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical economic studies often involve multiple propositions or hypotheses, with researchers aiming to assess both the collective and individual evidence against these propositions or hypotheses. To rigorously assess this evidence, practitioners frequently employ tests with quadratic test statistics, such as $F$-tests and Wald tests, or tests based on minimum/maximum type test statistics. This paper introduces a combination test that merges these two classes of tests using the minimum $p$-value principle. The proposed test capitalizes on the global power advantages of both constituent tests while retaining the benefits of the stepdown procedure from minimum/maximum type tests.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Panel Data Discrete Choice Models with Lagged Dependent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09379v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the identification and estimation of a class of semiparametric (distribution-free) panel data binary choice models with lagged dependent variables, exogenous covariates, and entity fixed effects. We provide a novel identification strategy, using an "identification at infinity" argument. In contrast with the celebrated Honore and Kyriazidou (2000), our method permits time trends of any form and does not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality". We propose an easily implementable conditional maximum score estimator. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are fully characterized. A small-scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that our approach performs satisfactorily in finite samples. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by presenting an empirical application to enrollment in private hospital insurance using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data.</description>

      <title>Marginal Effects for Probit and Tobit with Endogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When evaluating partial effects, it is important to distinguish between structural endogeneity and measurement errors. In contrast to linear models, these two sources of endogeneity affect partial effects differently in nonlinear models. We study this issue focusing on the Instrumental Variable (IV) Probit and Tobit models. We show that even when a valid IV is available, failing to differentiate between the two types of endogeneity can lead to either under- or over-estimation of the partial effects. We develop simple estimators of the bounds on the partial effects and provide easy to implement confidence intervals that correctly account for both types of endogeneity. We illustrate the methods in a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Fixed-b Asymptotics for Panel Models with Two-Way Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a cluster robust variance estimator proposed by Chiang, Hansen and Sasaki (2024) for linear panels. First, we show algebraically that this variance estimator (CHS estimator, hereafter) is a linear combination of three common variance estimators: the one-way unit cluster estimator, the "HAC of averages" estimator, and the "average of HACs" estimator. Based on this finding, we obtain a fixed-$b$ asymptotic result for the CHS estimator and corresponding test statistics as the cross-section and time sample sizes jointly go to infinity. Furthermore, we propose two simple bias-corrected versions of the variance estimator and derive the fixed-$b$ limits. In a simulation study, we find that the two bias-corrected variance estimators along with fixed-$b$ critical values provide improvements in finite sample coverage probabilities. We illustrate the impact of bias-correction and use of the fixed-$b$ critical values on inference in an empirical example on the relationship between industry profitability and market concentration.</description>

      <title>Uniform Inference for Subsampled Moment Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for solutions to conditional moment equations. The intervals are built around a class of nonparametric regression algorithms based on subsampled kernels. This class encompasses various forms of subsampled random forest regression, including Generalized Random Forests (Athey et al., 2019). Although simultaneous validity is often necessary in leading empirical applications--for example, in fine-grained characterization of heterogeneous treatment effects--only confidence intervals that confer pointwise guarantees were previously available. Our work closes this gap. As a by-product, we obtain several new order-explicit results on the concentration and normal approximation of high-dimensional U-statistics.</description>

      <title>On the Identifying Power of Monotonicity for Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a binary outcome, treatment, and instrument, Balke and Pearl (1993, 1997) establish that the monotonicity condition of Imbens and Angrist (1994) has no identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects in the sense that adding it to instrument exogeneity does not decrease the identified sets for those parameters whenever those restrictions are consistent with the distribution of the observable data. This paper shows that this phenomenon holds in a broader setting with a multi-valued outcome, treatment, and instrument, under an extension of the monotonicity condition that we refer to as generalized monotonicity. We further show that this phenomenon holds for any restriction on treatment response that is stronger than generalized monotonicity provided that these stronger restrictions do not restrict potential outcomes. Importantly, many models of potential treatments previously considered in the literature imply generalized monotonicity, including the types of monotonicity restrictions considered by Kline and Walters (2016), Kirkeboen et al. (2016), and Heckman and Pinto (2018), and the restriction that treatment selection is determined by particular classes of additive random utility models. We show through a series of examples that restrictions on potential treatments can provide identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects when the restrictions imply that the generalized monotonicity condition is violated. In this way, our results shed light on the types of restrictions required for help in identifying average potential outcomes and average treatment effects.</description>
