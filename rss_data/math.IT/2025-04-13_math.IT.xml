      <title>A General DoF and Pattern Analyzing Scheme for Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is one of the emerging topics for 6G communication due to its potential to reveal the performance limit of wireless communication systems. For EIT, one of the most important research directions is degree of freedom (DoF) analysis. Existing research works on DoF analysis for EIT focus on asymptotic conclusions of DoF, which do not well fit the practical wireless communication systems with finite spatial regions and finite frequency bandwidth. In this paper, we use the theoretical analyzing tools from Slepian concentration problem and extend them to three-dimensional space domain and four-dimensional space-time domain under electromagnetic constraints. Then we provide asymptotic DoF conclusions and non-asymptotic DoF analyzing scheme, which suits practical scenarios better, under different scenarios like three-dimensional antenna array. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the channel DoF is upper bounded by the proposed DoF of electromagnetic fields. Finally, we use numerical analysis to provide some insights about the optimal spatial sampling interval of the antenna array, the DoF of three-dimensional antenna array, the impact of unequal antenna spacing, the orthogonal space-time patterns, etc.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Rational Number Codes: Decoding Beyond Half the Minimum Distance with Multiplicities and Bad Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of (Abbondati et al., 2024) on decoding simultaneous rational number codes by addressing two important scenarios: multiplicities and the presence of bad primes (divisors of denominators). First, we generalize previous results to multiplicity rational codes by considering modular reductions with respect to prime power moduli. Then, using hybrid analysis techniques, we extend our approach to vectors of fractions that may present bad primes. Our contributions include: a decoding algorithm for simultaneous rational number reconstruction with multiplicities, a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's failure probability that generalizes several previous results, an extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be assumed random, and a unified approach to handle bad primes within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for rational number codes.</description>

      <title>Double Directional Wireless Channel Generation: A Statistics-Informed Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel models that represent various operating conditions a communication system might experience are important for design and standardization of any communication system. While statistical channel models have long dominated this space, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular alternative approach. However, existing approaches have mostly focused on predictive solutions to match instantaneous channel realizations. Other solutions have focused on pathloss modeling, while double-directional (DD) channel representation is needed for a complete description. Motivated by this, we (a) develop a generative solution that uses a hybrid Transformer (hTransformer) model with a low-rank projected attention calculation mechanism and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to generate complete DD channel information and (b) design a domain-knowledge-informed training method to match the generated and true channel realizations' statistics. Our extensive simulation results validate that the generated samples' statistics closely align with the true statistics while mostly outperforming the performance of existing predictive approaches.</description>

      <title>Sensing for Communication: RIS-Assisted ISAC Coordination Gain Enhancement With Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the potential to facilitate coordination gains from mutual assistance between sensing and communication (S&amp;C), especially sensing-aided communication enhancement (SACE). Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is another potential technique for achieving resource-efficient communication enhancement. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative RIS-assisted SACE (R-SACE) mechanism with the goal of improving the systemic communication performance of the ISAC system in practical scenarios where the channel status information (CSI) is imperfectly known. In the proposed R-SACE mechanism, a dual-functional base station (BS) provides downlink communication services to both the communication user and the dynamically changing target that is detected using the communication signals. RIS assists in both sensing and communications of the BS. A typical scenario is investigated in which either or both the direct and RIS-assisted reflected communication links are available depending on sensing results. The average systemic throughput (AST) over the entire timeline of the R-SACE mechanism is maximized by jointly optimizing both temporal and spatial resources under the probabilistic constraint and the sensing performance, transmission power, and communication interference constraints. The non-convex probabilistic mixed optimization problem is transformed and then solved by the proposed fixed-point iterative (FPI) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPI algorithm and R-SACE mechanism outperform the baseline algorithms and communication enhancement mechanisms in achieving higher systemic communication performance.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=1$ coincide with the optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686].
  We also consider classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy.</description>

      <title>Certified to Drive: A Policy Proposal for Mandatory Training on Semi-Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Boeing 737 Max incidents resulted from a mix of design shortcomings, regulatory oversights, and systemic issues, they also highlight a critical gap in pilot training on managing automated systems during abnormal conditions. This example demonstrates the urgent need for focused, concise training on human-automation interaction - a need that is equally critical for operators of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles, as discussed in detail later in this article. The lack of structured education for semi-automated vehicle operators mirrors similar risks in other industries, where formal training is critical for safe operation. Two policy recommendations are proposed. First, governments should create concise, official resources in accessible and official format to educate drivers on system capabilities and limitations. Second, mandatory training and certification programs should be introduced, combining theoretical and hands-on components to prepare drivers for real-world scenarios. These measures will improve driver understanding, reduce misuse, and foster public trust in semi-automated vehicle technologies. By addressing the knowledge gap, policymakers can ensure a safer, more responsible transition to automation, maximizing its benefits while minimizing risks to public safety.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Clustering and Signal Recovery under Block Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies computationally efficient methods and their minimax optimality for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signal structures. We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature aggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse and dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block signal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances and non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a block-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically from data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are consistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and weaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block structures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and computational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are restricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax boundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No algorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering or signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational) region of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods can achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes, respectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax optimal. A tuning parameter selection method is proposed based on post-clustering signal recovery results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. A case study on global temperature change demonstrates their utility in practice.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit Waveform and Receive Filter Design for ISAC System with Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, to suppress jamming in the complex electromagnetic environment, we propose a joint transmit waveform and receive filter design framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). By jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filters, we aim at minimizing the multiuser interference (MUI), subject to the constraints of the target mainlobe, jamming mainlobe and peak sidelobe level of the receive filter output as well as the transmit power of the ISAC base station. We propose two schemes to solve the problem, including joint transmit waveform and matched filter design (JTMD) and joint transmit waveform and mismatched filter design (JTMMD) schemes. For both schemes, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to iteratively optimize the transmit waveform and receive filters, where the number of targets as well as the range and angles of each target can also be estimated. Simulation results show that both the JTMD and JTMMD schemes achieve superior performance in terms of communication MUI and radar detection performance.</description>

      <title>On PIR and SPIR Over Gaussian MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15912v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the problems of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) and Symmetric PIR (SPIR). In PIR, there are $N$ replicated non-communicating databases containing the same $M$ messages and a user wishing to retrieve one message without revealing the message's index to the databases. SPIR extends this notion further by additionally protecting the privacy of the databases, ensuring that the user learns no information beyond the requested message. However, we assume a block-fading Additive White Gaussian Noise Multiple Access Channel (AWGN MAC) linking the user and the databases.}
  Previous work \cite{shmuel2021private} presented a joint channel-PIR scheme utilizing the Compute and Forward (C\&amp;F) protocol, demonstrating the potential of a joint PIR-channel coding scheme over a separated one, yet still lagging behind the channel capacity and requiring significant computational complexity.
  We propose an improved scheme that offers reduced computational complexity while improving the achievable rate for finite parameters and its scaling laws. Specifically, the achievable rate outperforms the C\&amp;F-based approach and scales with the number of databases $N$ and the power $P$ similarly to the channel capacity scaling laws \textit{without the privacy constraint}. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the improved rate exhibits only a finite gap from this unconstrained channel capacity -- $1$ $bit/sec/Hz$ as $N$ increases.
  \textcolor{black}{Additionally, we provide two SPIR schemes. The first is a modification for our PIR scheme to attain SPIR, which is accomplished by introducing shared common randomness among databases. The second is a novel joint channel-SPIR scheme that utilizes the channel and lattice codes' characteristics to nontrivially achieve SPIR without using common randomness.</description>

      <title>Sharp Estimates for Optimal Multistage Group Partition Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multistage group testing, the tests within the same stage are considered nonadaptive, while those conducted across different stages are adaptive. Specifically, when the pools within the same stage are disjoint, meaning that the entire set is divided into several disjoint subgroups, it is referred to as a multistage group partition testing problem, denoted as the (n, d, s) problem, where n, d, and s represent the total number of items, defectives, and stages respectively. This paper presents exact solutions for the (n, 1, s) and (n, d, 2) problems for the first time. Additionally, a general dynamic programming approach is developed for the (n, d, s) problem. Significantly we give the sharp upper and lower bounds estimates. If the defective number in unknown but bounded, we can provide an algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio in the asymptotic sense. While assuming the prior distribution of the defective items, we also establish a well performing upper and lower bound estimate to the expectation of optimal strategy</description>

      <title>Block Verification Accelerates Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for lossless acceleration of large language models during inference. It uses a fast model to draft a block of tokens which are then verified in parallel by the target model, and provides a guarantee that the output is distributed identically to a sample from the target model. In prior works, draft verification is performed independently token-by-token. Surprisingly, we show that this approach is not optimal. We propose Block Verification, a simple draft verification algorithm that verifies the entire block jointly and provides additional wall-clock speedup. We prove that the proposed mechanism is optimal in the expected number of tokens produced each iteration and specifically is never worse than the standard token-level verification. Empirically, block verification provides modest but consistent wall-clock speedups over the standard token verification algorithm of 5%-8% in a range of tasks and datasets. Given that block verification does not increase code complexity, maintains the strong lossless guarantee of the standard speculative decoding verification algorithm, cannot deteriorate performance, and, in fact, consistently improves it, it can be used as a good default in speculative decoding implementations.</description>

      <title>More global randomness from less random local gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.</description>
