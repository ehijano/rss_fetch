      <title>Hilbert-Samuel Polynomials for Algebras with Special Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of multiplicity of a module first arose as consequence of Hilbert's work on commutative algebra, relating the dimension of rings with the degree of certain polynomials. For noncommutative rings, the notion of multiplicity first appeared in the context of modules for the Weyl algebra in Bernstein's solution of the problem of analytic continuation posed by I. Gelfand. The notion was shown to be useful to many more noncommutative rings, especially enveloping algebras, rings of differential operators, and quantum groups. In all these cases, the existence of multiplicity is related to the existence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials. In this work we give an axiomatic definition of algebras with a notion of multiplicity, which we call very nice and modest algebras. We show, in an abstract setting, how the existence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials implies the existence of a notion of multiplicity. We apply our results for the category of min-holonomic modules -- a notion which coincides with holonomic modules for simple algebras -- and that shares many similarities with it. In particular, we generalize the usual results in the literature that are stated for Ore domains, in the more general context of prime algebras, and we show that rational Cherednik algebras admit a notion of multiplicity.</description>

      <title>The cohomology of the nilCoxeter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nilCoxeter algebra $\mathcal{N}S_n$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ is the algebra over $\mathbb{Z}$ with generators $Y_i$ ($1\leqslant i\leqslant n-1$), satisfying the braid relations $Y_iY_{i+1}Y_i=Y_{i+1}Y_iY_{i+1}$, $Y_iY_j=Y_jY_i$ ($|j-i|\geqslant 2$), together with the relations $Y_i^2=0$. We describe an explicit presentation for the cohomology ring $Z=\mathsf{Ext}^*_{\mathcal{N}S_n}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})$, with $n-i$ new generators in degree $i$ for $0&lt; i&lt;n$, and all relations are quadratic. We show that this $\mathsf{Ext}$ ring is $\mathbb{Z}$-free, and that it is a semiprime Noetherian affine polynomial identity (PI) ring with Poincar\'e series $1/(1-t)^{n-1}$ and PI degree $2^{n-2}$. For any field of coefficients $\mathbf{k}$, we show that $\mathsf{Ext}^*_{\mathbf{k}\mathcal{N}S_n}(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})$ is $\mathbf{k}\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} Z$. Similar results hold for other finite Coxeter types.</description>

      <title>The core-EP inverse: A numerical approach for its acute perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the concept of stable perturbation $B\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ for the core-EP inverse of a matrix $A\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ with index $k$. For a given stable perturbation $B$ of $A$, explicit expressions of its core-EP inverse $B^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny $\dagger$}}$ and its projection at zero $B^\pi$ are presented. Then, the perturbation bounds of $\parallel B^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny $\dagger$}}-A^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny $\dagger$}}\parallel/\parallel A^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny $\dagger$}}\parallel$ and $\parallel B^{\pi}-A^{\pi}\parallel$ are given provided that $B$ is a stable perturbation of $A$. In addition, we investigate the concept of acute perturbation of $A$. We give a perturbation analysis with respect to core-EP inverses. We provide a condition under which the acute perturbation coincides with the stable perturbation for core-EP inverses.</description>

      <title>Amalgamation in Semilinear Residuated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the state of the art on amalgamation in varieties of semilinear residuated lattices. Our discussion emphasizes two prominent cases from which much insight into the general picture may be gleaned: idempotent varieties and their generalizations ($n$-potent varieties, knotted varieties), and cancellative varieties and their relatives (MV-algebras, BL-algebras). Along the way, we illustrate how general-purpose tools developed to study amalgamation can be brought to bear in these contexts and solve some of the remaining open questions concerning amalgamation in semilinear varieties. Among other things, we show that the variety of commutative semilinear residuated lattices does not have the amalgamation property. Taken as a whole, we see that amalgamation is well understood in most interesting varieties of semilinear residuated lattices, with the last few outstanding open questions remaining principally in the cancellative setting.</description>

      <title>Coradically graded Hopf algebras with the dual Chevalley property of tame corepresentation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $H$ a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\Bbbk$ with the dual Chevalley property. In this paper, we show that $\operatorname{gr}^c(H)$ is of tame corepresentation type if and only if $\operatorname{gr}^c(H)\cong (\Bbbk\langle x,y\rangle/I)^* \times H^\prime$ for some finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H^\prime$ and some special ideals $I$. Then, by the method of link quiver and bosonization, we discuss which of the above ideals will occur when $(\Bbbk\langle x,y\rangle/I)^* \times H_0$ is a Hopf algebra of tame corepresentation type under some assumptions.</description>

      <title>Categorical properties and homological conjectures for bounded extensions of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extension $B\subset A$ of finite dimensional algebras is bounded if the $B$-$B$-bimodule $A/B$ is $B$-tensor nilpotent, its projective dimension is finite and $\mathrm{Tor}_i^B(A/B, (A/B)^{\otimes_B j})=0$ for all $i, j\geq 1$. We show that for a bounded extension $B\subset A$, the algebras $A$ and $B$ are singularly equivalent of Morita type with level. Additively, under some conditions, their stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein defect categories are equivalent, respectively. Some homological conjectures are also investigated for bounded extensions, including Auslander-Reiten conjecture, finististic dimension conjecture, Fg condition, Han's conjecture, and Keller's conjecture. Applications to trivial extensions and triangular matrix algebras are given.
  In course of proofs, we give some handy criteria for a functor between module categories induces triangle functors between stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein defect categories, which generalise some known criteria and hence, might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Is addition definable from multiplication and successor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A map $f\colon R\to S$ between (associative, unital, but not necessarily commutative) rings is a\emph{brachymorphism} if $f(1+x)=1+f(x)$ and $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ whenever $x,y\in R$. We tackle the problem whether every brachymorphism is additive (i.e., $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$), showing that in many contexts, including the following, the answer is positive: $R$ is finite (or, more generally, $R$ is left or right Artinian); $R$ is any ring of $2\times2$ matrices over a commutative ring; $R$ is Engelian; every element of $R$ is a sum of $\pi$-regular and central elements (this applies to $\pi$-regular rings, Banach algebras, and power series rings); $R$ is the full matrix ring of order greater than $1$ over any ring; $R$ is the monoid ring $K[M]$ for a commutative ring $K$ and a $\pi$-regular monoid $M$; $R$ is the Weyl algebra $A_1(K)$ over a commutative ring $K$ with positive characteristic; $f$ is the power function $x\mapsto x^n$ over any ring; $f$ is the determinant function over any ring $R$ of $n\times n$ matrices, with $n\geq3$, over a commutative ring, such that if $n&gt;3$ then $R$ contains $n$ scalar matrices with non zero divisor differences.</description>

      <title>Two-Term Polynomial Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algebras satisfying a two-term multilinear identity, namely one of the form $x_1\cdots x_n=qx_{\sigma(1)}\cdots x_{\sigma(n)}$, where $q$ is a parameter from the base field. We show that such algebras with $q=1$ and $\sigma$ not fixing~1 or~$n$ are eventually commutative in the sense that the equality $x_1\cdots x_k =x_{\tau(1)}\cdots x_{\tau(k)}$ holds for $k$ large enough and all permutations $\tau\in S_k$. Calling the minimal such~$k$ the degree of eventual commutativity, we prove that $k$ is never more than~$2n-3,$ and that this bound is sharp. For various natural examples, we prove that $k$ can be taken to be $n+1$ or $n+2$. In the case when $q\ne1$, we establish that the algebra must be nilpotent.</description>
