      <title>How the Shortest and Longest HILDCAAs Shaped Earth Outer Radiation Belt During the Van Allen Probes Era?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity long-duration continuous auroral electrojet (AE) activity (HILDCAA) events are associated with the enhancement of relativistic electron fluxes in the inner magnetosphere. The physical mechanisms underlying this enhancement are not well established yet. In this study, we analyze two contrasting HILDCAA events, one representing the shortest and the other the longest duration, using NASA Van Allen Probes observations, which have provided unprecedented, unique in-situ observations of the harsh radiation environment around the Earth. Detailed spectral and temporal analyses reveal that while both events trigger enhancements in electron flux across multiple energy channels, the shortest event is characterized by rapid, transient increases in energy levels. In contrast, the longest event produced sudden and markedly higher flux variation. The long duration event showed an acceleration of electrons to higher energy as compared to the shorter one. Moreover, a clear correlation between elevated ULF wave power for the longest event compared to the shortest is observed, apart from chorus waves responsible for relativistic electron acceleration. These findings underscore the importance of considering the duration of events in space weather models and assessment and provide valuable insights into the magnetospheric processes that modulate the variability of the radiation belt during HILDCAA conditions.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Tidal Locking on Magnetospheric Energy Input to Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of planetary corotation on energy dissipation within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system of exoplanets. Using MHD simulations, we find that tidally locked exoplanets have a higher cross-polar cap potential (CPCP) compared to fast-rotating planets with the same magnetic field strength, confirming previous studies. Our simulations show that for a given interplanetary magnetic field, an increase in corotation period leads to a higher CPCP. Notably, this difference in CPCP between tidally locked and rotating planets persists across a range of solar wind conditions, including extreme environments such as those experienced by hot Jupiters. Furthermore, we observe that variations in corotation have little impact on CPCP for Earth-sized planets. These results underscore the significance of both corotation dynamics and planetary size in understanding how exoplanets interact with their stellar environments.</description>
