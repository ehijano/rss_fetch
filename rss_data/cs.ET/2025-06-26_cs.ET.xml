      <title>Communicating Smartly in the Molecular Domain: Neural Networks in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20589v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>

      <title>LLM-Empowered IoT for 6G Networks: Architecture, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) in the sixth generation (6G) era is envisioned to evolve towards intelligence, ubiquity, and self-optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and beyond. In this article, we propose an LLM-empowered IoT architecture for 6G networks to achieve intelligent autonomy while supporting advanced IoT applications. LLMs are pushed to the edge of the 6G network to support the synergy of LLMs and IoT. LLM solutions are tailored to both IoT application requirements and IoT management needs, i.e., LLM for IoT. On the other hand, edge inference and edge fine-tuning are discussed to support the deployment of LLMs, i.e., LLM on IoT. Furthermore, we propose a memory-efficient split federated learning (SFL) framework for LLM fine-tuning on heterogeneous IoT devices that alleviates memory pressures on both IoT devices and the edge server while achieving comparable performance and convergence time. Finally, a case study is presented, followed by a discussion about open issues of LLM-empowered IoT for 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Some improvements to product formula circuits for Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide three improvements to the product formula implementation of the ground state energy estimation algorithm via Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. These consist of smaller circuit templates for each Hamiltonian term, parallelization of commuting controlled rotations, and more efficient parallel scheduling. These improvements may be regarded separately, and we anticipate that they may be combined with other improvements to the product formula implementation.</description>

      <title>GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14866v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, higher-density on-chip memory is needed for domain-specific accelerators beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, little work has incorporated dynamic application profiles into these design decisions, and no existing tools are expressly designed for this purpose. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By instrumenting retargetable architectural simulator backends with application- and device-agnostic analytical frontends, GainSight aligns workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics with mockups of emerging memory devices, informing system-level heterogeneous memory design. We also present a set of case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using simulated GPU and systolic array architectures, highlighting the utility of GainSight and the insights it provides: (1) 64% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Heterogeneous memory arrays that augment SRAM with GCRAM can reduce active energy consumption by up to 66.8%. To facilitate further research in this domain, GainSight is open source at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Evolution of Research Contributions using KnoVo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.</description>
