      <title>Coma cluster $\gamma$-ray and radio emission is consistent with a secondary electron origin for the radio halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of diffuse, non-thermal radio emission spanning several megaparsecs have been documented in over 100 galaxy clusters. This emission, classified as giant radio halos (GHs), mini halos, and radio relics based mainly on their location and morphology, is interpreted as synchrotron radiation and implies the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). GHs were initially thought to be generated by secondary electrons resulting from inelastic $p+p\rightarrow X+\pi^{\pm}$ collisions. However, recent literature has leaned towards primary-electron turbulent (re)acceleration models, partly due to claimed upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$ decay. We demonstrate that the observed GH and $\gamma$-ray flux in the Coma cluster are consistent with a secondary origin for the GH across a broad range of magnetic field values. Although the constraints on magnetic field configuration are not stringent, they align well with previous estimates for Coma. Within this magnetic field range, the energy density of cosmic-ray protons (CRp) constitutes a few percent to tens of percent of the ICM energy density, as predicted and observed for a sample of radio-emitting galaxy clusters. Notably, we detect a rise in the ratio of CRp to ICM energy densities towards the outer regions of the cluster. This phenomenon was anticipated to arise from either adiabatic compression of CRp accelerated by accretion shocks or, more likely, from strong CRp diffusion.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Propagation Models Elucidate the Prospects for Antinuclei Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tentative observations of cosmic-ray antihelium by the AMS-02 collaboration have re-energized the quest to use antinuclei to search for physics beyond the standard model. However, our transition to a data-driven era requires more accurate models of the expected astrophysical antinuclei fluxes. We use a state-of-the-art cosmic-ray propagation model, fit to high-precision antiproton and cosmic-ray nuclei (B, Be, Li) data, to constrain the antinuclei flux from both astrophysical and dark matter annihilation models. We show that astrophysical sources are capable of producing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ antideuteron events and $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ antihelium-3 events over 15~years of AMS-02 observations. Standard dark matter models could potentially produce higher levels of these antinuclei, but showing a different energy-dependence. Given the uncertainties in these models, dark matter annihilation is still the most promising candidate to explain preliminary AMS-02 results. Meanwhile, any robust detection of antihelium-4 events would require more novel dark matter model building or a new astrophisical production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Orbital Alignments of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the proposed space gravitational wave detector LISA, we will be able to measure the geometrical configurations of $\sim 10^4$ close white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. The obtained data will be an entirely new resource to examine the randomness of their orbital orientations. Partly motivated by a recent reported on the systematic alignments of bulge planetary nebulae, we discuss the outlook of the orientational analysis with LISA. We find that a quadrupole pattern as small as $\sim 0.05$ can be detected for bulge white dwarf binaries, owing to their large available number. From such a pattern analysis, we might geometrically explore fossil records in our Galaxy billions of years ago.</description>

      <title>Two-component off-axis jet model for radio flares of tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, radio emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been observed from months to years after the optical discovery. Some of the TDEs including ASASSN-14ae, ASASSN-15oi, AT 2018hyz, and AT 2019dsg are accompanied by the late-time rebrightening phase characterized by a rapid increase in the radio flux. We show that it can be explained by the off-axis two-component jet model, in which the late-time rebrightening arises from the off-axis view of a decelerating narrower jet with an initial Lorentz factor of ~10 and a jet opening angle of ~0.1 rad, while the early-time radio emission is attributed to the off-axis view of a wider jet component. We also argue that the rate density of jetted TDEs inferred from these events is consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Rapid Optical Flare in the Extreme TeV Blazar 1ES 0229+200 on Intraday Timescale with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object. It has not shown intraday variability in extensive optical and X-ray observations. Nor has it shown any significant variability on any measurable timescale in the 1-100 GeV energy range over a 14-year span, but variations in the source flux around its average are present in the energy range above 200 GeV. We searched for intraday optical variability in 1ES 0229+200 as part of an ongoing project to search for variability and quasi-periodic oscillations in the high-cadence, nearly uniformly sampled optical light curves of blazars provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 1ES 0229+200 was monitored by TESS in its Sectors 42, 43 and 44. We analysed the data of all these sectors both with the TESS provided lightkurve software and the eleanor reduction pipeline. We detected a strong, essentially symmetric flare that lasted ~6 hours in Sector 42. We fit the flare's rising and declining phases to exponential functions. We also analysed the light curve of Sector 42 using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) and continuous auto-regressive moving average (CARMA) methods. The Sector 42 light curve displayed in the present work provides the first evidence of a strong, rapid, short-lived optical flare on the intraday timescale in 1ES 0229+200. The variability timescale of the flare provides the upper limit for the size of the emission region to be within (3.3\pm0.2 - 8.3\pm0.5)x10^{15}cm. Away from the flare, the slope of the periodogram's power spectrum is fairly typical of many blazars (\alpha&lt;2), but the nominal slopes for the flaring regions are very steep (\alpha~4.3), which may indicate the electron distribution undergoes a sudden change. We discuss possible emission mechanisms that could explain this substantial and rapid flare.</description>

      <title>A short review of the pulsar magnetic inclination angles (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsar magnetic inclination angle is a key parameter for pulsar physics. It influences the observable properties of pulsars, such as the pulse beam width, braking index, polarisation, and emission geometry. In this study, we give a brief overview of the current state of knowledge and research on this parameter and its implications for the internal physics of pulsars. We use the observed pulsar data of magnetic inclination angle and braking index to constrain the star's number of precession cycles, $\xi$, which reflects the interaction between superfluid neutrons and other particles inside a neutron star\,(NS). We apply the method proposed by Cheng et al. (2019) to analyse the data of PSR J2013+3845 and obtain the constraints for $\xi$ ranging from $2.393\times 10^{5}$ to $1.268\times10^{6}$. And further analysis suggests that the internal magnetic field structure of PSR J2013+3845 is likely dominated by toroidal component. This study may help us understand the process of internal viscous dissipation and the related evolution of the inclination angles of pulsars, and may have important implications for the study of continuous gravitational wave emissions from NS.</description>

      <title>A Cyclic Spectroscopy Scintillation Study of PSR B1937+21 I. Demonstration of Improved Scintillometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high frequency-resolution analyses of multi-hour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain robust, intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Thanks to our high frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav's current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and undetermined effects due to the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. (2001) in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational wave detection efforts.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Free Precession in the Magnetar SGR 1806$-$20 with the ASCA GIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four X-ray data sets of the Soft Gamma Repeater SGR 1806-20, taken with the Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS) onboad ASCA, were analyzed. Three of them were acquired over 1993 October 9-20, whereas the last one in 1995 October. Epoch-folding analysis of the 2.8-12 keV signals confirmed the $\sim 7.6$ s pulses in these data, which Kouveliotou et al. (1998) reported as one of the earliest pulse detections from this object. In the 1995 observation, 3-12 keV pulses were phase modulated with a period of $T =16.4 \pm 0.4$ ks, and an amplitude of $\sim 1$ s. This makes a fourth example of the behavior observed from magnetars. Like in the previous three sources, the pulse-phase modulation of SGR 1806-20 disappeared at $\lesssim 2.5$ keV, where the soft X-ray component dominates. In the 1993 data sets, this periodic modulation was reconfirmed, and successfully phase-connected coherently across the 11 d interval. As a result, the modulation period was refined to $T =16.435 \pm 0.024$ ks. The implied high stability of the phenomenon strengthens its interpretation in terms of free precession of the neutron star, which is deformed to an asphericity of $\sim 10^{-4}$, presumably by the stress of toroidal magnetic fields reaching $\sim 10^{16}$ G. Toroidal fields of this level can be common among magnetars.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Equations: the bare essential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant progress in the development of general relativistic codes for the numerical solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics in spacetimes with high and dynamical curvature. These codes are valuable tools to explore the large-scale plasma dynamics such as that takes place when two neutron stars collide or when matter accretes onto a supermassive black hole. This chapter is meant to provide a very brief but complete overview of the set of equations that are normally solved in modern numerical codes after they are cast into a conservative formulation within a 3+1 split of spacetime.</description>

      <title>A short review on the pulsar magnetic inclination angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclination angle $\chi$ between magnetic and rotation axes of pulsars is an important parameter in pulsar physics. The changes in the inclination angle of a pulsar would lead to observable effects, such as changes in the pulse beam width and braking index of the star. In this paper, we perform a short review on the evolution of pulsar's magnetic inclination angle, as well as the latest research progress. Using an alignment rotator model in vacuum, we investigate the magnetic inclination angle change rates for 12 high-braking index pulsars without glitch, whose timing observations are obtained using the Nanshan 25-m Radio Telescope at Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory. For our purpose, three representative pulsars J0157+6212, J1743-3150 and J1857+0526 are chosen and their rotation and inclination angle evolutions are further investigated. In the future, radio and X-ray polarimetric observations will provide more information about the inclination angles of pulsars, which could help us understand the origin of the variations in $\chi$ of pulsars and shed light on the range of possibilities of pulsar magnetic field configuration. A continuous study of the pulsar inclination angle will provide an important window into additional physical processes at work in the young and highly magnetized pulsars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a long thermonuclear X-ray burst from the ultra-compact binary 4U 1850$-$087</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a long X-ray burst triggered on MJD 60171.65 from the ultra-compact binary 4U 1850$-$087 by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We analyse the NICER data observed in between MJD 60095.19$-$60177.43, including one observation covered part of the long X-ray burst tail, i.e., $0.15-3.8$ hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are quite similar and well described by a combination of multi-color disk blackbody, with the inner temperature of 0.5 keV, and a thermally comptonized continuum with the asymptotic power-law photon index of $\Gamma\sim2.2$, and electron temperature of $kT_{\rm e}\sim20-30$ keV. The persistent fluxes were around $3.8\times10^{-10}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a local accretion rate of $1\%~\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$. Part of time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robertson drag, or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst. From the burst flux during the cooling tail, we estimate the burst duration, $\tau \approx 0.78$ hr, the burst fluence, $E_\mathrm{b} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{41}$ ergs, and the ignition column depth, $y_{\rm ign}\approx 3.5\times10^{10}~{\rm g~cm^{-2}}$. We propose that the long X-ray burst is powered by unstable burning of pure helium in deep layer. Moreover, we identify significant 1 keV emission lines in the burst spectra, which may originate from the surrounding disk.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for the detection of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the AGILE space mission data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a cutting-edge frontier in artificial intelligence. It makes use of hybrid quantum-classical computation which tries to leverage quantum mechanic principles that allow us to use a different approach to deep learning classification problems. The work presented here falls within the context of the AGILE space mission, launched in 2007 by the Italian Space Agency. We implement different Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) that analyze data acquired by the instruments onboard AGILE to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts from sky maps or light curves. We use several frameworks such as TensorFlow-Quantum, Qiskit and PennyLane to simulate a quantum computer. We achieved an accuracy of 95.1% on sky maps with QCNNs, while the classical counterpart achieved 98.8% on the same data, using however hundreds of thousands more parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Properties of the Relativistic Jet and Hot Corona in AGN with X-ray Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry has been suggested as a prominent tool for investigating the geometrical and physical properties of the emissions from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The successful launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) on 9 December 2021 has expanded the previously restricted scope of polarimetry into the X-ray domain, enabling X-ray polarimetric studies of AGN. Over a span of two years, IXPE has observed various AGN populations, including blazars and radio-quiet AGN. In this paper, we summarize the remarkable discoveries achieved thanks to the opening of the new window of X-ray polarimetry of AGN through IXPE observations. We will delve into two primary areas of interest: first, the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration mechanisms in the jets of radio-loud AGN, such as blazars, where the relativistic acceleration process dominates the spectral energy distribution; and second, the geometry of the hot corona in radio-quiet AGN. Thus far, the IXPE results from blazars favor the energy-stratified shock acceleration model, and they provide evidence of helical magnetic fields inside the jet. Concerning the corona geometry, the IXPE results are consistent with a disk-originated slab-like or wedge-like shape, as could result from Comptonization around the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Cascade Radiations of $e^\pm$ from $\gamma\gamma$-annihilation process as an extra component of the Early Optical/X-Ray Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic break and/or plateau observed in the early optical and X-ray afterglow lightcurves challenge the conventional external shock models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Detection of TeV gamma-ray afterglows indicates strong gamma-ray production within the afterglow jets. We investigate the cascade radiations of the $e^\pm$ production via the $\gamma\gamma$ interaction in the jets. Our numerical calculations show that the cascade synchrotron emission can make a significant contribution to the early optical/X-ray afterglows. The combination of the primary and cascade emission fluxes can shape a chromatic break and/or plateau in the early optical/X-ray lightcurves, depending on the jet properties. Applying our model to GRBs 050801 and 080310, we found that their optical plateaus and the late X-ray/optical lightcurves can be explained with our model in reasonable parameter values. We suggest that such a chromatic optical plateau could be a signature of strong $e^\pm$ production in GRB afterglow jets. The TeV gamma-ray flux of such kind GRBs should be significantly reduced, hence tends to be detectable for those GRBs that have a single power-law decaying optical afterglow lightcurve.</description>

      <title>Spatially regular charged black holes supporting charged massive scalar clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, as opposed to the familiar charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black-hole spacetime, the spatially regular charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black-hole spacetime can support charged scalar clouds, spatially regular stationary matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields. Interestingly, we reveal the fact that the composed black-hole-field system is amenable to an analytical treatment in the regime $Q/M\ll1\ll M\mu$ of weakly charged black holes and large-mass fields, in which case it is proved that the dimensionless physical parameter $\alpha\equiv{{qQ}\over{M\mu}}$ must lie in the narrow interval $\alpha\in\big(\sqrt{{{3240}\over{6859}}},{{16}\over{23}}\big)$ [here $\{M,Q\}$ are the mass and electric charge of the central black hole and $\{\mu,q\}$ are the proper mass and charge coupling constant of the supported scalar field]. In particular, we explicitly prove that, for weakly charged black holes, the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\alpha(M,Q,\mu,q;n\}^{n=\infty}_{n=0}$ of the composed charged-ABG-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field cloudy configurations can be determined {\it analytically} in the eikonal large-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope \mbox{(AtLAST)} Science: Probing the Transient and Time-variable Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of transient and variable events, including novae, active galactic nuclei, and black hole binaries, has historically been a fruitful path for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of our universe. The study of such events in the millimeter and submillimeter is, however, still in its infancy. Submillimeter observations probe a variety of materials, such as optically thick dust, which are hard to study in other wavelengths. Submillimeter observations are sensitive to a number of emission mechanisms, from the aforementioned cold dust, to hot free-free emission, and synchrotron emission from energetic particles. Study of these phenomena has been hampered by a lack of prompt, high sensitivity submillimeter follow-up, as well as by a lack of high-sky-coverage submillimeter surveys. In this paper, we describe how the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) could fill in these gaps in our understanding of the transient universe. We discuss a number of science cases that would benefit from AtLAST observations, and detail how AtLAST is uniquely suited to contributing to them. In particular, AtLAST's large field of view will enable serendipitous detections of transient events, while its anticipated ability to get on source quickly and observe simultaneously in multiple bands make it also ideally suited for transient follow-up. We make theoretical predictions for the instrumental and observatory properties required to significantly contribute to these science cases, and compare them to the projected AtLAST capabilities. Finally, we consider the unique ways in which transient science cases constrain the observational strategies of AtLAST, and make prescriptions for how AtLAST should observe in order to maximize its transient science output without impinging on other science cases.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simmons electrodynamics and torsion dark matter axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the influence of torsion axial pseudo vector on dark photons in an axion torsionic background, as investigated previously by Duncan et al[ Nucl Phys B 387:215 (1992)]. Notably, axial torsion, owing to its significantly greater mass compared to axions, gives rise to magnetic helicity in torsionful Chern-Simons (CS) electrodynamics, leading to the damping of magnetic fields. In QCD scale the damping from dark massive photons leads us to obtain a magnetic field of $10^{-8}$ Gauss, which is approximated the order of magnitude of magnetic fields at present universe. This result is obtained by considering that torsion has the value of the 1 MeV at the early universe, and can be improved to the higher value of $10^{-3}$ Gauss when the axial torsion 0-component is given by $10^{8}$ MeV and the mass of dark photon is approximated equal to the axion. The axion plays a crucial role in achieving CS dynamo action arising from axions. This study is useful in deepening our understanding of fundamental physics, from nuclear interactions to the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The relationship of SMBHs and host galaxies at $z&lt;4$ in the deep optical variability-selected AGN sample in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the study on the relationship between SMBHs and their host galaxies using our variability-selected AGN sample ($i_\mathrm{AB} \leq 25.9,\ z \leq 4.5$) constructed from the HSC-SSP Ultra-deep survey in the COSMOS field. We estimated the BH mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{5.5-10}\ M_{\odot}$) based on the single-epoch virial method and the total stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{star}=10^{10-12}\ M_{\odot}$) by separating the AGN component with SED fitting. We found that the redshift evolution of the BH-stellar mass ratio ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{star}$) depends on the $M_\mathrm{BH}$ which is caused by the no significant correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and $M_\mathrm{star}$. Variable AGNs with massive SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$) at $1.5&lt;z&lt;3$ show considerably higher BH-stellar mass ratios ($&gt;\sim1\%$) than the BH-bulge ratios ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{bulge}$) observed in the local universe for the same BH range. This implies that there is a typical growth path of massive SMBHs which is faster than the formation of the bulge component as final products seen in the present day. For the low-mass SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&lt;10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$) at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$, on the other hand, variable AGNs show the similar BH-stellar mass ratios with the local objects ($\sim 0.1\%$) but smaller than those observed at $z &gt; 4$. We interpret that host galaxies harboring less massive SMBHs at intermediate redshift have already acquired sufficient stellar mass, although high-z galaxies are still in the early stage of galaxy formation relative to those at the intermediate/local universe.</description>

      <title>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on "Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a $\textit{parsimonious}$ manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the $\gamma$ Eddington parameter, which reads $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\varTheta}$, where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This $\textit{non-perturbative}$ result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian $\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$ expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value $\gamma_{\,\text{GR}}=1$ as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case $\varTheta$ approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. $\omega&gt;-3/2$, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Possible signatures of higher dimension in thin accretion disk around brane world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Evidence for eccentricity in the population of binary black holes observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in eccentric orbits produce distinct modulations the emitted gravitational waves (GWs). The measurement of orbital eccentricity can provide robust evidence for dynamical binary formation channels. We analyze 57 GW events from the first, second and third observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration using a multipolar aligned-spin inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and relativistic anomaly. This is made computationally feasible with the machine-learning code DINGO which accelerates inference by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional inference. First, we find eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors of 1.84 to 4.75 (depending on the glitch mitigation) for GW200129, 3.0 for GW190701 and 1.77 for GW200208_22. We measure $e_{\text{gw}, 10Hz}$ to be $0.27_{-0.12}^{+0.10}$ to $0.17_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ for GW200129, $0.35_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$ for GW190701 and $0.35_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ for GW200208_22. Second, we find $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors between the eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular precessing-spin hypothesis between 1.43 and 4.92 for GW200129, 2.61 for GW190701 and 1.23 for GW200208_22. Third, our analysis does not show evidence for eccentricity in GW190521, which has an eccentric aligned-spin against quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of 0.04. Fourth, we estimate that if we neglect the spin-precession and use an astrophysical prior, the probability of one out of the 57 events being eccentric is greater than 99.5% or $(100 - 8.4 \times 10^{-4})$% (depending on the glitch mitigation). Fifth, we study the impact on parameter estimation when neglecting either eccentricity or higher modes in eccentric models. These results underscore the importance of including eccentric parameters in the characterization of BBHs for GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Observational characterisation of large-scale transport and horizontal turbulent diffusivity in the quiet Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is a magnetic star, and the only spatio-temporally resolved astrophysical system displaying turbulent MHD thermal convection. This makes it a privileged object of study to understand fluid turbulence in extreme regimes and its interactions with magnetic fields. Global analyses of high-resolution solar observations provided by the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory can shed light on the physical processes underlying large-scale emergent phenomena such as the solar dynamo cycle. Combining a Coherent Structure Tracking reconstruction of photospheric flows, based on photometric data, and a statistical analysis of virtual passive tracers trajectories advected by these flows, we characterise one of the most important such processes, turbulent diffusion, over an unprecedentedly long monitoring period of 6 consecutive days of a significant fraction of the solar disc. We first confirm, and provide a new global view of the emergence of a remarkable dynamical pattern of Lagrangian Coherent Structures tiling the entire surface. These structures act as transport barriers on the time and spatial scale of supergranulation and, by transiently accumulating particles and magnetic fields, regulate large-scale turbulent surface diffusion. We then further statistically characterise the turbulent transport regime using two different methods, and obtain an effective horizontal turbulent diffusivity $D=2-3\times10^8~\mathrm{m}^2~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on the longest timescales probed. This estimate is consistent with the transport coefficients required in large-scale mean-field solar dynamo models, and is in broad agreement with the results of global simulations. Our analysis may also have implications for understanding the connections between solar-surface, coronal and solar-wind dynamics, and provides valuable lessons to characterise turbulent transport in other, unresolved turbulent astrophysical systems.</description>

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) reported observation of photons with energies above 10~TeV from gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. A suggestion was proposed that this result may contradict our knowledge of special relativity~(SR) and the standard model~(SM), according to which photons of about 10~TeV from such a distant object should be severely suppressed because of the absorption by extragalactic background light. As a result, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to solve this potential puzzle, including Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV). In this work, we perform a detailed numerical calculation and show the feasibility to constrain LIV of photons from the LHAASO observation of GRB 221009A quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection occurs ubiquitously in the universe and is often invoked to explain fast energy release and particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysics. The study of relativistic magnetic reconnection in the magnetically dominated regime has surged over the past two decades, revealing the physics of fast magnetic reconnection and nonthermal particle acceleration. Here we review these recent progresses, including the magnetohydrodynamic and collisionless reconnection dynamics as well as particle energization. The insights in astrophysical reconnection strongly connect to the development of magnetic reconnection in other areas, and further communication is greatly desired. We also provide a summary and discussion of key physics processes and frontier problems, toward a better understanding to the roles of magnetic reconnection in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz invariance violation from Vela pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S) Collaboration reported the discovery of a novel radiation component from the Vela pulsar by their Cherenkov telescopes. It is of great importance that gamma rays with energies of at least 20~TeV are recorded unexpectedly. The H.E.S.S Collaboration argued that such results may challenge the state-of-the-art models for the high-energy emission of pulsars. We point out in this work that these results also provide a unique opportunity to constrain certain Lorentz invariance violation parameters, leading to the realization of studying Lorentz invariance violation by using gamma-ray pulsars. The Lorentz invariance violation scale is constrained at the level of $E_{\mathrm{LV,}1}&gt; 1.66\times 10^{17} \rm GeV$ for the linear scenario, and $E_{\mathrm{LV,}2}&gt;3.53\times 10^{10} \rm GeV$ for the quadratic scenario. We anticipate that digging into the detailed features of the data of the Vela pulsar and analyzing potentially more very-high-energy photon data from pulsars in the future would improve the constraints on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

      <title>Honing cross-correlation tools for inference on ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray composition</title>

Abstract: The chemical composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays, namely the atomic number $Z$ of rays with energies $E\gtrsim40~\mathrm{EeV}$, remains to date largely unknown. Some information on the composition can be inferred from the deflections that charged ultra-high-energy cosmic rays experience while they traverse intervening magnetic fields. Indeed, such deflections distort and suppress the original anisotropy in the cosmic ray arrival directions; thus, given a source model, a measure of the anisotropy is also a measurement of the deflections, which in turn informs us on the chemical composition. In this work, we show that, by quantifying ultra-high-energy cosmic ray anisotropies through the angular cross-correlation between cosmic rays and galaxies, we would be able to exclude iron fractions $f_{\rm Fe}\geq{\cal O}(10\%)$ assuming a fiducial hydrogen map at $2\,\sigma$ level, and even smaller fractions in the reverse case of hydrogen on an iron map, going well below $f_{\rm H}\approx10\%$ when we mask the Galactic Centre up to latitudes of $40^\circ$. This is an improvement of a factor of a few compared to our previous method, and is mostly ascribable to a new test statistics which is sensitive to each harmonic multipole individually. Our method can be applied to real data as an independent test of the recent claim that current cosmic-ray data can not be reproduced by any existing model of the Galactic magnetic field, as well as an additional handle to compare any realistic, competing, data-driven composition models.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of 24 Previously Measured Black Hole Spins in X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our recent work on black hole spin in X-ray binary systems to include an analysis of 189 archival NuSTAR observations from 24 sources. Using self-consistent data reduction pipelines, spectral models, and statistical techniques, we report an unprecedented and uniform sample of 36 stellar-mass black hole spin measurements based on relativistic reflection. This treatment suggests that prior reports of low spins in a small number of sources were generally erroneous; our comprehensive treatment finds that those sources also tend to harbor black holes with high spin values. Overall, within $1\sigma$ uncertainty, $\sim86\%$ of the sample is consistent with $a \geq 0.95$, $\sim94\%$ of the sample is consistent with $a\geq 0.9$, and $100\%$ is consistent with $a\geq 0.7$ (the theoretical maximum for neutron stars; $a = cJ/GM^{2}$). We also find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs; those with A, B, or O-type companions) are consistent with $a\geq 0.9$ within $1\sigma$ errors; this is in agreement with the low-mass X-ray binary population and may be especially important for comparisons to black holes discovered in gravitational wave events. In some cases, different spectra from the same source yield similar spin measurements but conflicting values for the inclination of the inner disk; we suggest that this is due to variable disk winds obscuring the blue wing of the relativistic Fe K emission line. We discuss the implications of our measurements, the unique view of systematic uncertainties enabled by our treatment, and future efforts to characterize black hole spins with new missions.</description>

      <title>Isolated pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magneto-rotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron-star birth properties and their dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic-field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from log-normal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic-field decay with a power law. Each log-normal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and produce a large database of synthetic $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magneto-rotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the log-normal distributions, and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step towards robust statistical inference for complex population-synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multi-wavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>PEARLS: NuSTAR and XMM-Newton Extragalactic Survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey (Zhao et al. 2021) had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5, in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, logN-log S, down to 1.7 x 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 8-24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH &gt; 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), and 18+20% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (N&gt;10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented &gt;2$\sigma$ variability in the 3-year survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5-10keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(5)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in UGC10667. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario. Given our findings, we conclude that the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A is disfavoured by current state-of-the-art gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions for transport model and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is important to develop a unified theoretical framework to describe the nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on the same effective nuclear interactions. Based on the so-called Skyrme pseudopotential up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order, we construct a series of extended Skyrme interactions by modifying the density-dependent term and fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential up to above $1$ GeV, the empirical properties of isospin symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter and the properties of neutron stars from astrophysical observations. The modification of the density-dependent term in the extended Skyrme interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion and this leads to a highly flexible density behavior of the symmetry energy. In particular, the values of the density slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy for the new extended Skyrme interactions range from $L = -5$ MeV to $L = 125$ MeV by construction, to cover the large uncertainty of the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Furthermore, in order to consider the effects of isoscalar and isovector nucleon effective masses, we adjust the momentum dependency of the single-nucleon optical potential and the symmetry potential of these new extended Skyrme interactions and construct a parameter set family, by which we systematically study the impacts of the symmetry energy and the nucleon effective masses on the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. The new extended Skyrme interactions constructed in the present work will be useful to determine the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the symmetry energy, as well as the nucleon effective masses and their isospin splitting, in transport model simulations for heavy-ion collisions, nuclear structure calculations and neutron star studies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant from the $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$ shadow prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>
