      <title>Numerical Study of Quantum Oscillations of the Quasiparticle Lifetime: Impurity Spectroscopy, Novel Electric Field and Strain Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum oscillation (QOs) measurements constitute one of the most powerful methods for determining the Fermi surface (FS) of metals, exploiting the famous Onsager relation between the FS area and the QO frequency. The recent observation of non-Onsager QOs with a frequency set by the difference of two FS orbits in a bulk three-dimensional metal can be understood as the QO of the quasiparticle lifetime (QPL) due to interorbital scattering [Huber, Leeb, {\it et al.}, Nature 621 (2023)]. QPL oscillations (QPLOs) generalize magneto-intersubband oscillations (MISOs) known from coupled two-dimensional metals. They may provide a novel tool for extracting otherwise hard-to-measure intra-versus interband scattering times of quasiparticles. Here, we provide a numerical lattice study of QPLOs comparing transport and thermodynamic observables. We explore the effect of different imperfections like general impurities, Hall effect-induced electric fields, various forms of strain from bending, and magnetic field inhomogeneities. We confirm the basic phenomenology of QPLOs as predicted in analytical calculations and identify additional novel, non-perturbative features. Remarkably, we find that some imperfections can stabilize, or even enhance, non-Onsager QPLOs in contrast to standard QO frequencies. We discuss various avenues for identifying QPLOs in experiments and how to use their dependence on imperfections to extract material properties.</description>

      <title>Quantized electrical, thermal, and spin transports of non-Hermitian clean and dirty two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in the Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of $in\; silico$ EEG Brain Waves: Insights into oscillations and functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relation between EEG rhythms, brain functions, and behavioral correlates is well-established. Some mechanisms underlying rhythm generation are understood, enabling the replication of brain rhythms $in\; silico$. This allows to explore relations between neural oscillations and specific neuronal circuits, helping to decipher the functional properties of brain waves. Integrated information Decomposition ($\Phi$-ID) framework relates dynamical regimes with informational properties, providing deeper insights into neuronal dynamic functions. Here, we investigate wave emergence in an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balanced network of IF neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity producing a diverse range of EEG-like rhythms, from low $\delta$ waves to high-frequency oscillations. Through $\Phi$-ID, we analyze the network's information dynamics elucidating the system's suitability for robust information transfer, storage, and parallel operation. Our study identifies also regimes that may resemble pathological states due to poor informational properties and high randomness. We found that $in\; silico$ $\beta$ and $\delta$ waves are associated with maximum information transfer in inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, and the coexistence of excitatory $\theta$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ waves associated to information storage. Also, high-frequency oscillations can exhibit either high or poor informational properties, shedding light on discussions regarding physiological versus pathological high-frequency oscillations. Our study demonstrates that dynamical regimes with similar oscillations may exhibit different information dynamics. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of information dynamics in both model and experimental data analysis, could help discriminate between oscillations associated with cognitive functions and those linked to neuronal disorders.</description>

      <title>Survival Probability, Particle Imbalance, and Their Relationship in Quadratic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>
