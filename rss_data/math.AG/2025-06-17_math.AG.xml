      <title>Level structures on parahoric torsors and complete integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth complex algebraic curve $X$ and a reduced effective divisor $D$ on $X$, we introduce a notion of $D$-level structure on parahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-torsors over $X$, for any connected complex reductive Lie group $G$. A moduli space of parahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-torsors equipped with a $D$-level structure is constructed and we identify a canonical moment map with respect to the action of a level group on this moduli space. This action extends to a Poisson action on the cotangent, thus inducing a Poisson structure on the moduli space of logahoric $\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol \theta}$-Higgs torsors on $X$. A study of the generic fibers of the parahoric Hitchin fibration of this moduli space identifies them as abelian torsors and introduces new algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian Hitchin systems in this parahoric setting. We show that this framework generalizes, among other, the integrable system of Beauville and recovers the classical Gaudin model in its simplest form, the space of periodic KP elliptic solitons and the elliptic Calogero--Moser system, thus demonstrating that the logahoric Hitchin integrable system unifies many integrable systems with regular singularities under a single geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ and Noether-Lefschetz theory of $\mathcal{A}_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the genus 1 Gromov-Witten theory of the Hilbert scheme $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points in the plane. The fundamental 1-point invariant (with a divisor insertion) is calculated using a correspondence with the families local curve Gromov-Witten theory over the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$. The answer exactly matches a parallel calculation related to the Noether-Lefschetz geometry of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. As a consequence, we prove that the associated cycle classes satisfy a homomorphism property for the projection operator on $\mathsf{CH}^*(\mathcal{A}_g)$. The fundamental 1-point invariant determines the full genus 1 Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ modulo a nondegeneracy conjecture about the quantum cohomology. A table of calculations is given.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction theorems for coadmissible D-cap-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for Ardakov-Wadsley's coadmissible D-cap-modules and, more generally, for Bode's $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. More precisely, we show that any given $\mathcal{C}$-complex can be reconstructed out of its solutions. As a corollary, we find that slight modifications of the solution and de Rham functors introduced by the author are fully faithful on $\mathcal{C}$-complexes and, in particular, on coadmissible D-cap-modules. One of the many steps of our proof is the explicit computation of the continuous Galois cohomology of a certain decompletion of $B_{dR}^{+}$ which we call the positive overconvergent de Rham period ring.</description>

      <title>Characterization of fiberwise bimeromorphism and specialization of bimeromorphic types I: the non-negative Kodaira dimension case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent works of M. Kontsevich--Y. Tschinkel and J. Nicaise--J. C. Ottem on specialization of birational types for smooth families (in the scheme category) and J. Koll{\'a}r's work on fiberwise bimeromorphism, we focus on characterizing the fiberwise bimeromorphism and utilizing the characterization to investigate the specialization of bimeromorphic types for non-smooth families in the complex analytic setting. We provide some criteria for a bimeromorphic map between two families over the same base to be fiberwise bimeromorphic. By combining these criteria with ideas by D. Mumford--U. Persson and T. de Fernex--D. Fusi, as well as K. Timmerscheidt's approach via the relative Barlet cycle space theory, we establish the specialization of bimeromorphic types for locally Moishezon families with fibers having only canonical singularities and being of non-negative Kodaira dimension. These specialization results can easily lead to criteria for locally strongly bimeromorphic isotriviality. Throughout this paper, we unveil the connections among the four classical topics in bimeromorphic geometry: the deformation behavior of plurigenera (or even $1$-genus), fiberwise bimeromorphism, specialization of bimeromorphic types, and the bimeromorphic version of the deformation rigidity.</description>

      <title>The Rigidity of Constraint: A Spencer-Hodge Theoretic Approach to the Hodge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new theoretical perspective for studying the Hodge conjecture through an analytical framework based on constraint geometry. Our theory begins with a key observation: in compatible pair Spencer theory, a "differential degeneration" mechanism simplifies Spencer differential operators to classical exterior differential under specific algebraic conditions, bridging constraint geometry and de Rham cohomology. This bridge alone is insufficient to filter rare Hodge classes with algebraicity. We introduce the core concept -- "Spencer hyper-constraint conditions," a constraint system from Lie algebraic internal symmetry integrating: differential degeneration, Cartan subalgebra constraints, and mirror stability. This constraint principle filters geometric objects with excellent properties from degenerate classes, constructively defined as "Spencer-Hodge classes." To reveal their geometric significance, we "complex geometrize" the framework, integrating with Variation of Hodge Structures theory to construct Spencer-VHS theory. We establish connections between Spencer hyper-constraint conditions and flatness of corresponding sections under Spencer-Gauss-Manin connections. With the "Spencer-calibration equivalence principle" and "dimension matching strong hypothesis," flatness directly corresponds to algebraicity, providing sufficient conditions for verifying the Hodge conjecture. This forms "Spencer-Hodge verification criteria," transforming the proof problem into investigating whether three structured conditions hold: geometric realization of Spencer theory, satisfaction of algebraic-dimensional control, and establishment of the Spencer-calibration equivalence principle. This framework provides new perspectives for understanding this fundamental problem.</description>

      <title>The Morel-Voevodsky Construction over Algebraic Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give a construction of the (un-)stable motivic homotopy category of an algebraic stack in the spirit of Morel-Voevodsky. We prove that this new construction agrees with the stable motivic homotopy category defined by Chowdhury and D'Angelo. As an application, we extend Bachmann's spectral rigidity theorem to algebraic stacks. Moreover, we extend the construction of the framed motivic homotopy category to algebraic stacks and prove Hoyois' Reconstruction Theorem in this setting. Finally, we discuss an extension of the formalism of cocomplete coefficient systems \`a la Drew-Gallauer to algebraic stacks.</description>

      <title>An illustration of formal moduli problems with differential graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an exposition to the topic of formal moduli problems, emphasizing its connections with differential graded Lie algebras, and mainly following from Jacob Lurie's DAG X: Formal Moduli Problems. As such, this paper should not be viewed as a presentation of original work, but rather a concise introduction to the subject in the form of a set of organized notes. I hoped to make this paper feel welcoming and insightful for the non-expert enjoyer of derived algebraic geometry, like myself. Enjoy!</description>

      <title>Chow cohomology and Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any smooth, projective variety satisfies the Hodge conjecture in codimension one, known as the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem. Totaro formulated a version for singular varieties. He asked whether the natural Bloch-Gillet-Soul\'{e} cycle class map from the operational Chow group to the (1,1)-classes in the weight graded piece of the cohomology group is surjective? In this short article, we give a sufficient criterion for this to hold. In particular, we show that several singular varieties with at worst isolated singularities (log canonical, divisorial log terminal, ADE-singularities) satisfy the singular Hodge conjecture in codimension 1.</description>

      <title>On quadratic persistence and Pythagoras numbers of totally real projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between quadratic persistence and the Pythagoras number of totally real projective varieties. Building upon the foundational work of Blekherman et al. in arXiv:1902.02754, we extend their characterizations of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay varieties with next-to-maximal quadratic persistence to arbitrary case. Our main result classifies totally real non-aCM varieties of codimension $c$ and degree $d$ that exhibit next-to-maximal quadratic persistence in the cases where $c=3$ and $d \geq 6$ or $c \geq 4$ and $d \geq 2c+3$. We further investigate the quadratic persistence and Pythagoras number in the context of curves of maximal regularity and linearly normal smooth curves of genus 3.</description>

      <title>Proper Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian varieties and points outside the Fourier-Mukai loci in Matsui spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any smooth proper Fourier-Mukai partner of an abelian variety is an abelian variety by computing the Matsui spectrum of the derived category. While this result was previously shown by Huybrechts and Nieper-Wisskirchen in the case of smooth projective varieties, we extended it to the proper setting using a completely different method.
  We also show that, for certain proper schemes, the set of points lying outside the Fourier-Mukai locus in the Matsui spectrum of the derived category has cardinality at least that of the base field. This suggests the existence of geometric structures outside the Fourier-Mukai locus, such as moduli spaces. Furthermore, we prove that Ito's conjecture -- which predicts that the Serre invariant locus coincides with the Fourier-Mukai locus -- fails for simple abelian varieties of dimension greater than two. Although counterexamples -- K3 surfaces of Picard number one -- were given by Hirano-Ouchi, no other counterexamples had been known prior to our work.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove that given a smooth proper family over a $p$-adic ring of integers, one gets a control of its crystalline torsion in terms of its \'{e}tale torsion, the cohomological degree, and the ramification. Our technical core result is a boundedness result concerning annihilator ideals of $u^{\infty}$-torsion in Breuil--Kisin prismatic cohomology, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Classically psh and pluriharmonic functions on Berkovich spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First we extend the theory of subharmonic functions on smooth strictly $k$-analytic curves from Thuillier's thesis to the case of possibly singular analytic curves over a non-archimedean field. Classically psh functions are then defined as in complex geometry by using pullbacks to analytic curves (and requiring compatibility with base change). We give various properties of classically psh functions including a local and a global maximum principle. As a consequence, we show that the space of pluriharmonic functions on a quasi-compact Berkovich space is finite dimensional. As a technical tool, we use that a connected Berkovich space is connected by analytic curves.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the generic invariance of the Fano type property in cases where the volumes of anti-canonical divisors of Fano type fibers are a constant over a Zariski-dense subset, or the Fano type fibers are dimension $2$. Additionally, paralleling this theorem, we establish a conjecture by Schwede and Smith under the condition that the volumes of anti-canonical divisors remain constant in the reduction mod $p$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the log canonical threshold of a potentially klt triple can be computed by a quasi-monomial valuation. The notion of potential triples provides a larger and more flexible framework to work with than that of generalized pairs. Our main result can be considered as an extension to the result of Xu on klt pairs. As an application of the main result, we show that we can run the MMP on any potentially klt triples and $-(K_X+\Delta)$-MMP on the potentially klt pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, we prove that the generic initial ideal with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic term order of a general rational or elliptic curve on quadrics is almost revlex. Following constructive arguments, our proof combines features of a pencil of quadrics, interpolation methods and the notion of double generic initial ideal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the dualizable localizing ideals of rigidly-compactly generated tt-$\infty$-categories that are cohomologically stratified. By definition, these are the localizing ideals that are dualizable with respect to the Lurie tensor product. We prove that these ideals correspond to the convex subsets of the Balmer spectrum. More generally, we establish this classification for categories which are locally cohomologically stratified and whose Balmer spectrum is noetherian. The classification thus applies to many categories arising in algebra and topology, including derived categories of noetherian schemes. Our result generalizes, and is motivated by, a recent theorem of Efimov which establishes this classification for derived categories of commutative noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>An explicit local geometric Langlands for supercuspidal representations: the toral case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a conjecture on local geometric Langlands for supercuspidal representations using Yu's data and Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism. We refine our conjecture for a large family of regular supercuspidal representations defined by Kaletha, and then confirm the conjecture for toral supercuspidal representations of Adler whose Langlands parameters turn out to be exactly all the irreducible isoclinic connections. As an application, we establish the conjectural correspondence between global Airy connections for reductive groups and the family of Hecke eigensheaves constructed by Jakob-Kamgarpour-Yi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{X}$ be a Geigle-Lenzing projective plane of type $(2,2,2,p)$ and $\mathsf{coh} \mathbb{X}$ the category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{X}$. This paper is devoted to study ACM tilting bundles over $\mathbb{X}$, that is, tilting objects in the derived category $\mathsf{D}^{\rm b}(\mathsf{coh} \, \mathbb{X})$ that are also ACM bundles. We show that a tilting bundle consisting of line bundles is the $2$-canonical tilting bundle up to degree shift. We also provide a program to construct ACM tilting bundles, which give a rich source of (almost) $2$-representation infinite algebras. As an application, we give a classification result of ACM tilting bundles.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Imsets for Cyclic Linear Causal Models and the Chickering Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two directed graphs are called covariance equivalent if they induce the same set of covariance matrices, up to a Lebesgue measure zero set, on the random variables of their associated linear structural equation models. For acyclic graphs, covariance equivalence is characterized both structurally, via essential graphs and characteristic imsets, and transformationally, through sequences of covered edge flips. However, when cycles are allowed, only a transformational characterization of covariance equivalence has been discovered. We consider a linear map whose fibers correspond to the sets of graphs with identical characteristic imset vectors, and study the toric ideal associated to its integer matrix. Using properties of this ideal we show that directed graphs with the same characteristic imset vectors are covariance equivalent. In applications, imsets form a smaller search space for solving causal discovery via greedy search.</description>

      <title>Serre's question on thin sets in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Serre on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results. We obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field. To achieve this we adapt the determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials and we use recently obtained quadratic dependence on the degree when bounding rational points on curves.</description>

Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Jacobian criterion of Fargues-Scholze for spaces of sections of a smooth quasi-projective variety over the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Namely, we show how to use their criterion to deduce an analogue for spaces of sections of a smooth Artin stack over the (schematic) Fargues-Fontaine curve obtained by taking the stack quotient of a smooth quasi-projective variety by the action of a linear algebraic group. As an application, we show various moduli stacks appearing in the Fargues-Scholze geometric Langlands program are cohomologically smooth Artin $v$-stacks and compute their $\ell$-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Kummer surfaces and quadratic line complexes in characteristic two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical theory of quadratic line complexes and Kummer surfaces. A quadratic line complex is the intersection of the Grassmannian $G(2,4)$ and a quadric hypersurface in ${\bf P}^5$, and a Kummer surface is the quotient of the Jacobian of a curve of genus 2 by the inversion. F. Klein discovered a relationship between a quadratic line complex and a curve of genus 2, its Jacobian and the associated Kummer surface. This theory holds in any characteristic not equal to two. However the situation in characteristic two is entirely different. The purpose of this paper is to give an analogue in characteristic 2 of this classical theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that on any Noetherian $F$-finite $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme, there is an anti-equivalence of categories between Cartier crystals and \'etale perverse $\mathbb{F}_p$-sheaves, commuting with derived proper pushforwards. We use this duality to construct an upper shriek functor for Cartier crystals, and give new proofs of Kashiwara's equivalence and the finite length of Cartier crystals. Finally, we deduce a generic vanishing statement for perverse $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-sheaves on abelian varieties of characteristic $p &gt; 0$, reminiscent of the characteristic zero and $l$-adic statements.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we aim to extend the concepts of the Fontaine-Faltings module and Higgs-de Rham flow to their parabolic versions. The crucial aspect of our generalization lies in the construction of parabolic inverse Cartier functors. The twisted versions discussed in Sun, Yang, and Zuo's work can be seen as a special case, where the parabolic weights are equal at every infinity point. We note that a modulo $p$ version of parabolic Higgs-de Rham flow was previously established in \cite{KrSh20} in a different way.</description>

      <title>The motivic Hecke algebra for PEL Shimura varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a motivic lift of the action of the Hecke algebra on the cohomology of PEL Shimura varieties $S_K$. To do so, when $S_K$ is associated with a reductive algebraic group $G$ and $V$ is a local system on $S_K$ coming from a $G$-representation, we define a motivic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ as a natural sub-algebra of the endomorphism algebra, in the triangulated category of motives, of the constructible motive associated with $S_K$ and $V$. The algebra $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ is such that realizations induce an epimorphism from it onto the classical Hecke algebra. We then consider Wildeshaus' theory of interior motives, along with the necessary hypotheses for it to be employed. Whenever those assumptions hold, one gets a Chow motive realizing to interior $V$-valued cohomology of $S_K$, equipped with an action of $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ as an algebra of correspondences modulo rational equivalence. We give a list of known cases where this applies.</description>

Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that $X$ is a complete intersection provided that $n \geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called ``a Tate-Shafarevich twist'') is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the general fiber of the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ is primitive (that is, not divisible) in integer homology. We also assume that $\pi$ has reduced fibers in codimension 1. Then $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of Ulrich bundles on cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^n$ of arbitrary degree $d$. Given a relatively Ulrich bundle on a complete intersection subvariety, we construct a relatively Ulrich bundle on the ambient variety. As an application, we prove that there exists a rank $d$ Ulrich bundle on generic cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^2$ of degree $d$ such that the degree of the branch divisor $d \cdot k$ is even. When $d \cdot k$ is odd, we also provide an estimation of the rank of the Ulrich bundle on generic cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give two explicit versions of the decomposition theorem of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne applied to the universal family of quartic surfaces of $\mathbb{P}^3$. The starting point of our investigation is the remark that the nodes of a quartic surface impose independent conditions to the linear system $\mid \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb P^3}(4)\mid$. Although this property is known in literature, we provide a different argument more suited to our purposes. By a result of \cite{DGF}, the independence of the nodes implies in turn that each component of Severi's variety is smooth of the expected dimension and that the dual variety is a divisor with normal crossings around Severi's variety. This allows us to study the complex $R\pi{_*}\mathbb{Q}_{\mathcal{X}}$, the derived direct image of the constant sheaf over the universal family of quartic surfaces $ \mathcal{X} \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb P^{34}$, both in the open set parametrizing smooth and nodal quartics and in a tubular neighborhood of the variety of Kummer surfaces. We obtain in both cases an explicit decomposition and a formality result for the complex $R\pi{_*}\mathbb{Q}_{\mathcal{X}}$.</description>

Abstract: For every imprimitive complex reflection group of rank 2, we construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category of the associated global quotient stack which categorifies the usual decomposition of the orbifold cohomology indexed by conjugacy classes. This confirms a conjecture of Polishchuk and Van den Bergh in these cases. This conjecture was recently also proved by Ishii and Nimura for arbitrary complex reflection groups of rank 2 and real reflection groups of rank 3, but our approach is very different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Solution and de Rham functors for D-cap-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We lay the groundwork for a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for Ardakov-Wadsley's D-cap-modules by introducing corresponding solution and de Rham functors. Our constructions rely on Scholze's $p$-adic Hodge theory for rigid-analytic varieties, but we work over a decompletion of $B_{dR}^{+}$ which we call the positive overconvergent de Rham period ring. The main result of this article is the compatibility of our de Rham functor with Scholze's horizontal sections functor. This may be regarded as a generalisation of the classical non-Archimedean Cauchy Theorem, which roughly states that $p$-adic differential equations on unit discs have nonzero radius of convergence.</description>

      <title>Chai's conjectures on base change conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The base change conductor is an invariant introduced by Chai which measures the failure of a semiabelian variety to have semiabelian reduction. We investigate the behaviour of this invariant in short exact sequences, as well as under duality and isogeny. Our results imply Chai's conjecture on the additivity of the base change conductor in short exact sequences, while also showing that a proposed generalisation of this conjecture fails. We use similar methods to show that the base change conductor is invariant under duality of Abelian varieties in equal positive characteristic (answering a question of Chai), as well as giving a new short proof of a formula due to Chai, Yu, and de Shalit which expresses the base change conductor of a torus in terms of its (rational) cocharacter module.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences using modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many generating series of combinatorially interesting numbers have the property that the sum of the terms of order $&lt;p$ at some suitable point is congruent to a zero of a zeta-function modulo infinitely many primes $p$. Surprisingly, very often these congruences turn out to hold modulo $p^2$ or even $p^3$. We call such congruences supercongruences and in the past 15 years an abundance of them have been discovered. In this paper we show that a large proportion of them can be explained by the use of modular functions and forms.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic automorphisms of Markov-type surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every complex surface of Markov type, i.e.\ the variety given by $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + Exyz - Ax - By - Cz - D = 0$, has the symplectic density property and the Hamiltonian density property. We prove a singular symplectic version of the Anders{\'e}n--Lempert theorem for normal reduced affine complex varieties and apply it to describe the holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of a complex surface of Markov type. To this end, we also investigate the germs of vector fields in isolated singularities of type $A_k$ and $D_k$. Moreover, we show that any injective self-map of the set of ordered Markov triples can be realized by a holomorphic symplectic automorphism.</description>
