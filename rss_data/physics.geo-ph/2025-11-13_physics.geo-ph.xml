      <title>Introducing GeoHEAT: Georadar-aided High-resolution Exploration for Advancing geoThermal energy usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel geothermal exploration approach that integrates innovations at three spatial scale. At the regional scale (~100 km) we create LCOE heat maps using a techno-economic and metamodel analysis. This allows us to choose several potential sites to perform a reservoir scale (~10 km) assessment with passive seismics and gravity. By integrating the latter with probabilistic geological and geomechanical modeling we propose locations to drill exploration boreholes. Then follows a high-resolution borehole characterization incorporating various analyses, the central one being a georadar probe that allows to illuminate permeable structures. Within this project, we also design and build a geothermal grade georadar. Here, we present the approach and result from the application of our methodology to the Swiss canton of Thurgau, with the purpose of large-scale geothermal exploration.</description>

      <title>Resolving Thermospheric Vertical Wind Ambiguities and Energy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applies a generalized vertical coordinate system approach alongside thermodynamic control volume analysis to explore the nuanced interpretations of energy transfer processes associated with vertical motion in the thermosphere. Using simulations from the TIEGCM V3.0 model, a key finding reveals that transforming vertical winds in height coordinates onto constant pressure surfaces contain a substantial lifting component; an aspect often overlooked in previous research. This distinction is critical for internal energy assessments, as vertical winds defined in pressure coordinates directly contribute to the adiabatic heating or cooling rates while only a portion of the vertical wind in height coordinates contributes to these energy changes. These differences are demonstrated through schematic representations of thermodynamic control volumes that model a column of thermospheric gas undergoing various energy transfer processes. Accurately determining the portion of observed vertical winds that affect internal energy requires clear understanding between height and pressure surfaces; a nontrivial challenge in observational contexts. Furthermore, applying the generalized vertical coordinate framework to airglow emissions in the upper thermosphere uncovers an inherent ambiguity: vertical winds inferred from airglow observations may not align with those defined on pressure or altitude surfaces. This insight suggests that discrepancies in the behavior and magnitude of vertical winds derived from FPI observations of red-line emissions in the upper thermosphere are due to poorly known relations between the emission structure relative to pressure or height surfaces.</description>

      <title>Effect of submerged vegetation on water surface geometry and air-water momentum transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how submerged vegetation modifies the water surface is crucial for modeling momentum exchange between shallow waters and the atmosphere. In particular, quantifying its impact on the equivalent aerodynamic roughness of the water surface is essential for improved boundary-layer parameterization in oceanic and atmospheric models. In this Letter, we present fully resolved multiphase simulations of gravity-driven flow over a fully submerged vegetated bed, capturing the coupled dynamics of air, water, and individual plant stems, under quasi-realistic conditions (the air/water viscosity ratio is real, while the density ratio is reduced tenfold). Our results show that vegetation submerged for four times its height regularizes the water surface suppressing strong deformations and homogenizing streamwise-propagating wave fronts along the transversal direction. Despite these alterations, the equivalent roughness perceived by the overlying air flow remains unchanged. These findings clarify vegetation-surface interactions and provide quantitative insights for nature-based wave mitigation strategies and atmospheric boundary-layer modeling.</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of surfactant driven secondary invasion in Gaussian pore networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capillarity-dominated two-phase displacement in porous media often continues beyond the initial invasion-percolation (IP) breakthrough, as surfactants alter interfacial properties and reopen pathways once sealed by capillary forces. This study examines such secondary invasion, where adsorption-driven reductions in interfacial tension and contact-angle shifts lower entry thresholds in yet uninvaded throats, enabling further displacement at a fixed inlet pressure. To capture this process, we employ a time-dependent pore-network framework that couples IP with a reduced-order transport-adsorption module. Local fluxes are governed by Poiseuille flow, interfacial adsorption follows a Langmuir isotherm, and wettability evolution is modeled through a calibrated phenomenological relation. Heterogeneity is prescribed by Gaussian throat-size distributions whose variance controls structural disorder. The resulting invasion trajectories are sigmoidal, consistent with Gaussian cumulative statistics, indicating that surfactant mass-transfer kinetics and network variance primarily rescale invasion timescales while preserving the overall functional form. The framework thus connects interfacial conditioning to time-varying capillary thresholds and reveals how surfactant-mediated processes govern post-breakthrough dynamics in heterogeneous porous systems.</description>

      <title>The InSAR absolute phase amid singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radar interferometric absolute phase is essential for estimating topography and displacements. However, its conventional definition based on the range difference is idealized in that it cannot be applied to complex, dynamic targets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is easiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is determined by temporally unwrapping the phase while continuously varying the intermediate acquisition time between primary and secondary acquisitions. This absolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series of observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is proportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For general targets undergoing a cyclic change, the absolute phase may be nonzero and then cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity (vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase becomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute phase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through multifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional interferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths need to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer multiples of $2 \pi$. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for unwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase singularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute phase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR processing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low coherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities.</description>
