      <title>Holography for de Sitter bubble geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the de Sitter static patch holographic proposal and the bilayer holographic entanglement entropy prescription to de Sitter geometries containing a bubble of smaller positive or vanishing cosmological constant. When the causal patch of an observer at the center of the bubble overlaps with the ``parent'' de Sitter region, we propose that the full spacetime can be holographically encoded on two holographic screens. The leading geometrical entanglement entropy between the two screens, which can be constant or time-dependent in some cases, never exceeds the Gibbons-Hawking entropy associated with the ``parent'' de Sitter space. When the causal patch of the observer at the center of the bubble is causally disconnected from the ``parent'' de Sitter region, the holographic proposal no longer applies, and more than two holographic screens are required to encode the whole spacetime.</description>

      <title>A New Supersymmetry Index for Symmetric Orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new supersymmetry index for symmetric orbifold CFTs in the setup of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. In a novel formulation for symmetric orbifold CFTs based on the Schur-Weyl duality, we show how this index naturally emerges and its protection follows from the detailed nature of exactly marginal operators in these theories. This index is a one-parameter generalization of the standard index and gives more fine-grained information about the structure of microstates than previously available. For the case of the D1-D5 CFT for $T^4$ we demonstrate precise matching of the new index between supergravity and CFT below the black-hole threshold, where the standard index -- the modified elliptic genus -- is trivial. Above the threshold, we uncover a decomposition of black-hole microstates into distinct sectors, invisible to the modified elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>The SymTFT for $N$-ality defects: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to obtain the SymTFT for a theory with an $N$-ality extension of a discrete, Abelian group $G$, one begins by considering a bulk $G$-gauge theory, and then gauges an appropriate $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. This procedure involves three choices: the choice of a suitable bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, of a fractionalization class, and of a discrete torsion. The first choice is, somewhat surprisingly, the most involved, and in this paper we discuss it in detail. In particular, we show that the choice of bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry determines all boundary $F$-symbols with a single incoming $N$-ality defect, and that any theory with an $N$-ality symmetry is invariant under a certain twisted gauging given in terms of these $F$-symbols. These $F$-symbols can furthermore be input into the pentagon identities to obtain the other $F$-symbols, up to freedoms related to the choices appearing in the second and third steps of bulk gauging. Although many of our results hold for general $N$, we restrict ourselves in some places to the case of $N=p$ prime. In particular, for generic triality defects, we acquire explicit $F$-symbols which are reminiscent of those in Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Quiver Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a study of the entanglement entropy (EE) in a class of four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ linear quiver SCFTs deformed by the presence of a VEV. We review the holographic backgrounds dual to these theories, and calculate the EE for different Ryu-Takayanagi embeddings. We allow the embeddings to explore, in addition to the usual spatial direction, the internal coordinate $z$, associated with the quiver degrees of freedom. Via the numerical optimization of splines on triangulations, we find the minimal configuration and the value of the EE for the different embeddings and quiver parameters. Our results agree with previous studies showcasing phase transitions in the EE. We also provide novel results illuminating the dependence of the EE on the fundamental and gauge degrees of freedom, signaling partial deconfinement, which are worthy of further study.</description>

      <title>From Cusps to Swallowtails: Domain Wall singularities in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective Nambu-Goto description of $(2+1)$-dimensional domain walls predicts singular behavior of its worldsheet resulting in swallowtail bifurcations. This phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of cusps, which emerge in different forms that we identify and classify. We describe in detail how swallowtail bifurcations generically arise in the collision of wiggles on straight domain wall strings, as well as in the collapse of closed loops, even for smooth initial conditions. Remarkably, by means of accurate lattice simulations, we find that these distinctive swallowtail features are reproduced in the field theory evolution of sufficiently thin walls, typically emitting a significant fraction of their initial energy in the process. These results suggest that such singular evolutions could potentially have important implications for the observable signatures associated with the collapse of domain wall networks in (3+1) dimensions in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Chronology Protection of Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (&gt;-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.</description>

      <title>Higher-Spin Poisson Sigma Models and Holographic Duality for SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SYK models provide an interesting playground for exploring the $AdS_2/CFT_1$ correspondence. We focus on a class of SYK models that exhibit higher-spin symmetry, whose gravity sector is described by a BF theory generalizing Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity to higher spins. We further develop this framework by constructing consistent interactions between higher-spin gauge fields and scalar matter fields. Two concrete realizations are proposed: Model A, arising from a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, and Model B, a perturbatively local Poisson sigma-model with an infinite-dimensional target space. While both capture higher-spin dynamics on $(A)dS_2$, they differ in their algebraic structures and locality properties, thus offering complementary perspectives on higher-spin holography.</description>

      <title>Schwinger effect in dynamical holographic QCD with a supercritical region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of QCD matter using a dynamical Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton holographic model, using both thermodynamic and dynamical observables. Depending on the warp factor, the model admits either a standard confinement/deconfinement transition or a first-order \textit{specious confinement}/deconfinement transition ending at a critical end point (CEP), giving rise to a rich phase diagram with a supercritical region. We probe this structure using both thermodynamic (heat capacity) and dynamical (squared speed of sound, IR wall) observables. We show that the loci of maxima in the heat capacity and minima in the sound speed define two distinct crossover lines emanating from the CEP and extending into the supercritical region, each tracing a different separation between confined-like and deconfined-like matter. As a dynamical probe, the persistence of the IR wall introduces another separation line, not emanating from the CEP, and reveals a triangular region, before the CEP, where the system is thermodynamically confined but dynamically deconfined. We further study the Schwinger effect as a nonperturbative probe of vacuum instability, determining the critical and threshold electric fields in both confined and deconfined phases. In the specious confined phase and in the confined-like phase beyond the critical end point, these fields depend on temperature and chemical potential, unlike in the standard confined phase, and we are able to trace their behavior for the first time including the supercritical region. Our results highlight the complementarity of thermodynamic and dynamical probes in mapping the QCD phase diagram and, in particular, establish the Schwinger threshold and critical fields as sensitive diagnostics of confinement not only in the known phase transitions but also in the supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>Aspects of non-minimally coupled curvature with power laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of theories containing power-law terms in both the Ricci scalar and a scalar field, including their non-minimal couplings. As a first step, we systematically classify all non-trivial cases with a propagating scalar field that arise from the simplest general power-law formulation, which contains the minimal number of terms. We then analyze each case in detail, focusing on the structure of the degrees of freedom, by both formulating the theories in the Einstein frames and focusing on the singular points in the Jordan frame. We demonstrate that such theories can give rise to different, and sometimes unexpected structure of the modes, that can change at the leading order depending on the background.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Fluctuations and the Renormalized Stress-Energy Tensor on a Cone with Arbitrary Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum fluctuations and the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field of mass $M$ in a conical spacetime, where the topological singularity at the apex requires boundary conditions for the field equation. The necessity of boundary conditions was established by Kay and Studer in the early 1990s, but the consequences of their arbitrariness, represented here by a parameter $q$, for renormalized observables have not been examined. While for $M=0$ stability is achieved only under Dirichlet boundary conditions, for $M&gt;q$ the field is stable and a localized mode emerges. This mode admits a natural interpretation as a covariant model of an extended particle detector, which allows us to investigate how such detectors modify the local vacuum structure. In this framework, the renormalized stress-energy tensor offers a natural way to quantify the influence of the detector on the surrounding spacetime.</description>

      <title>An invisible extended Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a localized particle detector model formulated as a massive quantum field on Minkowski spacetime with the spatial origin excised. To render the problem well-posed at the puncture, we impose boundary conditions at the excised point, which we take to be of Robin type. This setup yields a discrete sector, given by bound-state solutions of the radial equation with real, positive frequencies, which characterizes the detector. We construct the full two-point function and show its decomposition into: (i) the discrete radial bound-state sector, (ii) the boundary condition modified continuous sector, and (iii) the unmodified Dirichlet sector. We then compute the detector field's stress-energy tensor and prove its covariant conservation. For the specific localized modes in this setup, the discrete-sector contribution cancels in the complete stress-energy tensor, leaving only boundary-condition induced terms. Notably, the discrete modes crucial to localized field-based detectors emerge naturally from the boundary conditions, without ad hoc confining potentials, providing a fully relativistic framework that extends the traditional Unruh-DeWitt paradigm. This mechanism is not restricted to Minkowski spacetime: the same construction can be applied to massive fields on backgrounds with naked singularities, such as conical and global monopole spacetimes, offering a unified route to detector localization in a broad class of geometries.</description>

      <title>Universality in the resurgence of generalized Tracy-Widom distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze determinants associated with Bessel kernels and generic symbol functions, which govern a class of observables across all values of the 't Hooft coupling in supersymmetric gauge theories. Previous approaches, based on integro-differential equations, have provided systematic strong-coupling expansions for the logarithms of these determinants, expressed through the moments of the symbol. The resulting asymptotic series, once completed with non-perturbative terms, allowed the leading resurgence relations to be tested. In this Letter we focus directly on the determinants themselves, and we uncover a strikingly simple non-perturbative structure: all trans-series corrections share a universal form, while the moments transform in a direct and intuitive way. This simplicity points to an underlying organizing principle for the non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theory observables.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Complementary Recovery in Holographic Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic codes are a type of error-correcting code with extra geometric structure ensured by a ``complementary recovery'' property: given a division of the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into $\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, and an algebra of physical operators $\mathcal{M}\subseteq (\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}})$, the logical operators in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_L)\simeq \mathcal{L}(P\mathcal{H})$ which can be created by acting in $\mathcal{M}$ are identical to the logical operators whose expectation values cannot be altered by acting in the commutant $\mathcal{M}^\prime$, and vice versa. In arXiv:2110.14691, a uniqueness theorem was stated: the only possible tuple of (code, bipartition, algebra) which can exhibit complementary recovery is the maximal one $\mathcal{M}=P(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}_A)\otimes I_{\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}})P$. We point out a counterexample to this result, using a ``non-adjacent'' bipartition of a four-qubit code proposed in arXiv:2110.14691. We show that the failure of uniqueness is due to a failure to enforce error correction against erasure of $\mathcal{H}_{\bar A}$, which requires enforcing the algebraic Knill-Laflamme condition $[P E_i^\dagger E_j P,\mathcal{M}]=0$ for each pair of error operators. When we add the additional requirement that $\mathcal{M}$ be correctable with respect to this channel, uniqueness is restored, and we re-prove the theorem of arXiv:2110.14691 with this added assumption. We present the list of bipartitions of the ``atomic'' holographic codes in arXiv:2110.14691 in which the correctability assumption can be violated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitationally induced interference within the framework of teleparallel gravity, deriving a general expression for the gravitational phase difference and applying it to an EMS spacetime. We then analyze how this phase difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless, while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters via quantum interferometric techniques.</description>

      <title>The optical analogy between a Lorentz-violating cosmos and a Magneto-Electric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of our study is to investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation by examining the behavior of photons within the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME). We show that, from an optical point of view, the Lorentz-violating cosmos is analogous to a Magneto-Electric medium like the quantum vacuum in the presence of the magnetic and electric field. This analogy provides a formulation for exploring experimental evidence of Lorentz symmetry violation in the propagation of light in a vacuum, in particular in the case of a radiation background observed like the CMB.</description>

      <title>Penrose Process Efficiency and Irreducible Mass in Rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld Black Holes with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Bohm effect: reality and folklore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect has been a major focus of the foundations of physics. And yet, much confusion persists. In particular, the effect purportedly leads to a dilemma: on one horn, we have a non-local action of a gauge-invariant quantity on charged particles; on the other, we get a local action on these particles, but of a non-gauge invariant quantity. This is the folklore, but the folklore is filled with misconceptions. Here, by deploying a recently defended formulation of gauge theory that dispenses with principal bundles, gauge potentials, and explicit gauge symmetries, I argue, with previous authors, that the A-B effect can be understood gauge-independently. But here my argument will go further: I will show that the A-B effect, when expressed in terms of the covariant derivative of a vector bundle, is \emph{entirely} analogous to the holonomy of spacetime vectors, and can be understood completely locally. The only surprising idea illustrated by the A-B effect is that, in some circumstances, there is more to the covariant derivative than can be accounted for by the curvature and underlying topology of a vector bundle.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain self-force calculations using Gegenbauer reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHS), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a re-projection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Black holes black out: total absorption in time-dependent scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Dark Matter Prompt and Secondary Signatures in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent.
  For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM.
  In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.</description>

      <title>A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100\AA-3000\AA) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450\AA), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.</description>

Abstract: General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\'enic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\'enic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between computation and scattering both operationally (hence phenomenologically) and formally. We show how topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs) enable universal quantum computation, using the Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro models to show how TQNNs implement quantum error-correcting codes. We then exhibit a formal correspondences between TQNNs and amplituhedra to support the existence of amplituhedra for generic quantum processes. This construction shows how amplituhedra are geometric representations of underlying topological structures. We conclude by pointing to applications areas enabled by these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.</description>

Abstract: We formulate thermal quantum field theory on a finite spatial periodic volume undergoing rotation. Traditional compactifications at finite temperature without rotations typically involve ${\mathbb T}^4$ as the space-time manifold within a path integral formulation and also moving frames can be accommodated by shifted boundary conditions on the same space. We show that consistent descriptions of a rotating box are possible on space-time manifolds with topology different from ${\mathbb T}^4$ but still flat and without boundary and we classify all possible geometries. The non-trivial topology may be implemented by rotated boundary conditions allowing for a path integral formulation. The purely imaginary angular velocity in temperature units cannot be arbitrary but several discrete values are possible. We also discuss finite volume effects in detail.</description>

      <title>Collinear Structure of Nonlinear Small-$x$ Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to high-energy QCD factorization of cross-sections for processes involving a dilute projectile and a dense target. Our method preserves the factorization between "fast" and "slow" modes in the longitudinal momentum $k^+$ for a projectile moving along the positive light-cone direction, making it compatible with higher-order loop computations done within the standard formulation of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Moreover, it eliminates the anomalous double collinear logarithms that typically hinder the convergence of perturbation theory at small-$x$. Our scheme amounts to a change of basis in the space of CGC operators, introducing an arbitrary transverse scale dependence while leaving physical cross-sections invariant. Implementing this scheme requires a modification of the high-energy renormalization group equation for the CGC operators, which we explicitly derive at next-to-leading order (NLO) and in the non-linear regime for the case of the dipole operator and the DIS impact factor. This general framework provides a consistent and systematic prescription for computing observables in the small-$x$ regime of QCD, free from collinear instabilities.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) within the framework of $f(T,{L}_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is generalized as a function of the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian ${L}_m$. We analyze three representative $f(T,{L}_m)$ models and derive constraints on their free parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, by combining observational bounds from the freeze-out temperature with the primordial abundances of deuterium, helium-4, and lithium-7. For each model, the parameter space consistent with all elemental $Z$-constraints and the freeze-out condition is determined. These results demonstrate that $f(T,{L}_m)$ modifications can accommodate the tight observational constraints of BBN, suggesting that minimal extensions to the matter sector provide viable alternatives to the standard cosmological description and offer a promising framework for exploring modified gravity in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Directly Probing Neutrino Interactions through CMB Phase Shift Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Non-toric brane webs, Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study webs of 5-branes with 7-branes in Type IIB string theory from a geometric perspective. Mathematically, a web of 5-branes with 7-branes is a tropical curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with focus-focus singularities introduced. To any such a web $W$, we attach a log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with a line bundle $L$. We then describe supersymmetric webs, which are webs defining 5d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), in terms of the geometry of $(Y,D,L)$. We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs called ``consistent webs", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric web can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using birational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an algorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon. Moreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric construction of the mirror $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a non-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain how to derive explicit equations for $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ using scattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or equivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a procedure for calculating the boundary stress tensor of a gravitational theory in asymptotic flat spacetime. As a case study, the stress tensor correctly reproduces the Brown-York charges for the Kerr blackhole i.e. mass and angular momentum. In asymptotic flat spacetime, there are asymptotic symmetries called BMS symmetries. We also compute the charges associated with these symmetries with the proposed stress tensor. The asymptotic charges can be compared with the Wald-Zoupas method. Our result for the stress tensor can be interpreted as the expectation value for the boundary stress tensor.</description>

Abstract: We find matching pairs of the line defect indices for 3d supersymmetric Abelian gauge theories as strong evidence of dualities of the BPS line operators. They lead to novel duality maps of the BPS line operators for $\mathcal{N}\ge 4$ supersymmetric circular and linear quiver gauge theories which can be realized as brane configurations in Type IIB string theory, including SQED, ADHM and ABJM theories.</description>

      <title>Localization of strings on group manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the partition function of the WZW model with target a compact Lie group $G$ by adapting a method used by Choi and Takhtajan to compute the heat kernel of the group manifold. The basic idea is to compute the partition function of a supersymmetric version of the WZW model using a form of supersymmetric localization and then use the fact that, since the fermions of the supersymmetric WZW model are actually decoupled from the bosons, this also determines the partition function of the purely bosonic WZW model. The result is a formula for the partition function as a sum over contributions from abelian classical solutions. We verify for $G=SU(2)$ that this formula agrees with the result for the same partition function that comes from the Weyl-Kac character formula. We extend the method of supersymmetric localization to certain related models such as the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model and a Wick-rotated version of this model in which the target space is hyperbolic three-space $H_3^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously identified integrable boundary states in ABJM theory are exclusively achiral. This paper presents the first chiral integrable boundary states in the $SU(4)$ alternating spin chain from the planar two-loop dilatation operator in the scalar sector. Utilizing a sufficient condition for the untwisted integrable condition, we identify specific two-site and four-site basis boundary states as chiral integrable states. Numerical evidence indicates that other basis states are unlikely to be chiral integrable. Furthermore, we compute the overlaps between these chiral integrable basis states and on-shell Bethe eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

Abstract: This is the manual of the first version of QEDtool, an object-oriented Python package that performs numerical quantum electrodynamics calculations, with focus on full state reconstruction in the internal degrees of freedom, correlations and entanglement quantification. Our package rests on the evaluation of Feynman amplitudes in the momentum-helicity basis within a relativistic framework. Users can specify both pure and mixed initial scattering states in polarization space. From the specified initial state and Feynman amplitudes, QEDtool reconstructs correlations that fully characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state. These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in Lorentz transformations.</description>

Abstract: The four-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) theory provides a systematic procedure for realizing two-dimensional integrable field theories. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether integrable deformations of the theories can be realized in the four-dimensional CS theory. In this work, we study $T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional integrable field theories, formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the framework of four-dimensional CS theory coupled to disorder defects. We illustrate our procedure in detail for the degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-model, a specific construction that captures and unifies a broad range of integrable systems, including the principal chiral model.</description>

      <title>Self interacting scalar field theory in general curved spacetimes at zero and finite temperature revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), its restoration, and phase transition for a self interacting quantum scalar field in a general curved background, at zero and finite temperature. To the best of our knowledge, most of the earlier computations in this context have been done in the linear order in curvature, which may not be very suitable for the Ricci flat spacetimes. One of our objectives is to see whether the higher order terms can bring in qualitatively new physical effects, and thereby attempting to fill in this gap in the literature. We use Bunch and Parker's local momentum space representation of the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion of the Feynman propagator. Such expansion, being based upon the local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime, essentially probes the leading curvature correction to short scale, ultraviolet quantum processes. We compute the renormalised, background spacetime curvature (up to quadratic order) and temperature dependent one loop effective potential for $\phi^4$ plus $\phi^3$ self interaction. In particular for the de Sitter spacetime, we have shown for the $\phi^4$-theory that we can have SSB even with a positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling, at zero temperature. This cannot be achieved by the linear curvature term alone and the result remains valid for a very large range of renormalisation scale. Such SSB will generate a field mass that depends upon the spacetime curvature as well as the non-minimal coupling. For a phase transition, we have computed the leading curvature correction to the critical temperature. At finite temperature, symmetry restoration is demonstrated. We also extend some of the above results to two loop level. The symmetry breaking in de Sitter at two loop remains present. We have further motivated the necessity of treating this problem non-perturbatively in some instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, and determine its corresponding spectral properties. Since the persistence of thermal Goldstone modes within symmetry-restored phases is predicted to be a model-independent characteristic, this has fundamental consequences for systems in which continuous symmetries are restored at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory: An innovative framework for eliminating renormalization ambiguities in QCD and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), an innovative framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion through Effective Dynamical Renormalization (EDR) with Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM) constraints. This approach yields completely scale and scheme invariant observables whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to the experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD and QED, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with scheme-independent equations, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$ through EDR implementation. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05262 \pm 0.0005$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring calculation that are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approaches. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76)$), differing from the experiment by only $-1.2(81) \times 10^{-13}$ representing an excellent 0.15$\sigma$ agreement. The framework enables the self-consistent extraction of the natural electromagnetic coupling $\alpha_{\text{eff}}^{-1}(m_e) = 137.036005301$ at the electron mass scale.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach to Quark-Antiquark Color Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for modelling the spatial distribution of chromodynamic fields induced by quark-antiquark pairs, based on lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to conventional neural networks, PINNs incorporate physical laws-expressed here as differential equations governing type-II superconductivity-directly into the training objective. By embedding these equations into the loss function, we guide the network to learn physically consistent solutions. Adopting an inverse problem approach, we extract the parameters of the superconducting equations from lattice QCD data and subsequently solve them. To accommodate physical boundary conditions, we recast the system into an integro-differential form and extend the analysis within the fractional PINNs framework. The accuracy of the reconstructed field distribution is assessed via relative $L_2$-error norms. We further extract physical observables such as the string tension and the mean width of the flux tube, offering quantitative insight into the confinement mechanism. This method enables the reconstruction of colour field profiles as functions of quark-antiquark separation without recourse to predefined parametric models. Our results illuminate aspects of the dual Meissner effect and highlight the promise of data-driven strategies in addressing non-perturbative challenges in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a lattice determination of the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in (2+1)-flavor QCD with almost physical quark masses. The momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients are extracted for a wide temperature range, from $T=163$ MeV to $10$ GeV. The results are in agreement with previous works from the HotQCD collaboration, and show fast thermalization of the heavy quark inside the QGP. Near the chiral crossover temperature $T_c\simeq150$ MeV, our results are close to the AdS/CFT estimation computed at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>The Casimir eigenvalues on $ad^{\otimes k}$ of SU(N) are linear on N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalues of the Casimir operator on the naturally defined \textit{stable sequences} of representations of $su(N)$ algebra and prove that eigenvalues are linear over $N$ iff $\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+...+k\lambda_k=\lambda_{N-1}+2\lambda_{N-2}+...+k\lambda_{N-k}$, where $\lambda_i$ are Dynkin labels, and $\lambda_i=0$ for $k&lt;i&lt;N-k$, with fixed $k$. These representations are exactly those which appear in the decomposition of $ad(su(N))^{\otimes k}$, therefore this linearity admits the presentation of eigenvalues in the universal, in Vogel's sense, form, and supports the hypothesis of universal decomposition of $ad^{\otimes k}$ into Casimir eigenspaces.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show using the Hamiltonian formalism that if parity is a good symmetry of QCD, then the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta}$ must be $0$ or $\pi$. We find that for $P$ to be a physical symmetry, it must leave the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum invariant ($P: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$), which is possible only for $\theta = 0$ or $\pi$. We also show that forming linear combinations of states from different $\theta$-sectors produces only classical statistical mixtures, consistent with superselection rules, confirming that $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ is the most general Hilbert space for the quantum theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that requiring $[P,\Omega]=0$, where $\Omega$ is the generator of large gauge transformations, independently enforces $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$), and that for complex quark mass matrix $M$, if a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$ is a symmetry, then the value of $\theta$ gets determined so that it exactly cancels $Arg Det M$, again giving $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$). These results establish the equivalence of the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches to the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way. Nevertheless, the minimal coupling of nonmetricity scalar and the matter current might not be favored.</description>

      <title>Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
  We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</description>
