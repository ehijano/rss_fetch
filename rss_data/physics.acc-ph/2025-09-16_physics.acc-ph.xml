      <title>Experimental Characterization and Simulation-Based Analysis of the RIT-2.5 Radiofrequency Ion Thruster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the RIT-2.5 radiofrequency ion thruster, complemented by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to establish correlations between plasma parameters and extracted beam properties. The thruster was operated in a dedicated vacuum facility and equipped with optical spectroscopy, Faraday cup, and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) diagnostics. Electron temperature was determined from optical emission line ratios (Te about 3-7 eV), while the energy distribution of extracted ions was measured using the RFEA. A comparative simulation campaign was performed to reproduce the experimentally observed energy spectra and to extract plasma density values otherwise inaccessible due to the lack of intrusive diagnostics, yielding best-fit estimates of ne about 1.2x10E16 m-3. The results demonstrate that the energy spread of the extracted beam is strongly dependent on plasma density and electron temperature. The combined experimental-numerical approach provides a non-intrusive yet robust pathway for performance optimization of RF ion thrusters, offers validation benchmarks for advanced plasma simulation codes, and is particularly well-suited to compact micro-N-class thrusters for nanosatellite attitude and orbit control.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimizations of High Gradient C-band Photoinjector for High Bunch Charge Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high gradients potentially achievable in distributed-coupling C-band photoinjectors make them attractive for many high brightness applications. Here we discuss optimization results for a 1.6 cell C-band photoinjector with a 240 MV/m peak field at the cathode that delivers a 250 pC electron bunch charge. We use a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), obtaining a Pareto front of emittance vs. bunch length. We also perform MOGA optimizations including an aperture to retain only a bright beam core. We find this reduces the emittance of the final beam by more than factor of 2 in some cases. For example, we find that at a root mean square bunch length of 1.6 ps, the use of an aperture improves the transverse emittance from 120 nm to 58 nm assuming negligible photocathode intrinsic emittance. The sacrificial charge at the periphery of the electron beam removed by the aperture linearizes the final slice phase space inside of the remaining beam core. The results obtained surpass the experimental state-of-the-art for beamlines with similar bunch charge.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design Report of Super Tau-Charm Facility: The Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11522v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&amp;D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.</description>

      <title>Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Particle Physics Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) established the Working Group (WG) on the Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators in 2024 with the mandate to develop guidelines and a list of key parameters for the assessment of the sustainability of future accelerators in particle physics. While focused on accelerator projects, much of the work will also be relevant to other present and upcoming research infrastructures. The development and continuous update of such a framework aim to enable a coherent communication amongst scientists and adequately convey the information to a broader set of stakeholders. This document outlines the key findings and recommendations of the LDG Sustainability WG and provides a summary of current best practices aimed at enabling sustainable accelerator-based research infrastructures. Not all sustainability topics are addressed at the same level. The assessment process is complex, largely under development and a homogeneous evaluation of all the aspects requires a strategy to be developed and implemented over time.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Multi-Scale LTS Magnet Simulations with Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the prediction of AC losses during transients is critical for designing large-scale low-temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets, brute-force finite-element (FE) simulation of their detailed geometry down to the length scale of the conductors is a computational challenge. Multi-scale methods, balancing between a coarse approximation of the fields at the scale of the magnet and a detailed description at the scale of the conductors, are promising approaches to reduce the computational load while keeping a sufficient accuracy. In this work, we introduce a neural network approach to accelerate multi-scale magneto-thermal simulations of LTS magnets by replacing costly single-turn FE models with neural network surrogates. The neural network architecture is presented and discussed, together with an automated procedure for generating simulation data for its training. The resulting accelerated multi-scale model is used to simulate current ramp-up procedures for the IBA S2C2 magnet. The surrogate-based multi-scale model is compared with a conventional multi-scale model based on a composite wire-in-channel FE model. The surrogate model is shown to reproduce single-turn filament hysteresis, inter-filament coupling, and eddy losses, while the computational time of the multi-scale method is reduced by a factor of 800.</description>

      <title>Development of a national thrust test facility for electric propulsion at Robinson Research Institute, New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD) thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to the facilities are in progress or planned.</description>

      <title>FCC-ee Lessons from SuperKEKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SuperKEKB has achieved significantly higher specific luminosity than its predecessor KEKB, and it has proven a much more sustainable machine. It has successfully demonstrated several key design elements of FCC-ee. The design luminosity has not yet been reached, however. This observation is often (mistakenly) used to put into question the reliability of the FCC-ee design luminosity. In this note we review the accomplishments, challenges and obstacles of SuperKEKB, and compare these with the FCC-ee design.</description>
