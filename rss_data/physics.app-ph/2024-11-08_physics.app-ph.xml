      <title>Giant memory function based on the magnetic field history of resistive switching under a constant bias voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors, which are characterized by their unique input-voltage-history-dependent resistance, have garnered significant attention for the exploration of next-generation in-memory computing, reconfigurable logic circuits, and neural networks. Memristors are controlled by the applied input voltage; however, the latent potential of their magnetic field sensitivity for spintronics applications has rarely been explored. In particular, valuable functionalities are expected to be yielded by combining their history dependence and magnetic field response. Here, for the first time, we reveal a giant memory function based on the magnetic field history of memristive switching, with an extremely large magnetoresistance ratio of up to 32,900% under a constant bias voltage, using a two-terminal Ge-channel device with Fe/MgO electrodes. We attribute this behavior to colossal magnetoresistive switching induced by the d0 ferromagnetism of Mg vacancies in the MgO layers and impact ionization breakdown in the Ge substrate. Our findings may lead to the development of highly sensitive multi-field sensors, high-performance magnetic memory, and advanced neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spintronic THz Emitters Without External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art spintronic THz emitters (W or Ta)/CoFeB/Pt with non-magnetic underlayer deposited using oblique angle deposition. The THz emission amplitude in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field remains the same and remarkably stable over time. This stability is attributed to the enhanced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic layer, achieved by oblique angle deposition of the underlying non-magnetic layer. Our findings could be used for the development of practical field-free emitters of linearly polarized THz radiation, potentially enabling novel applications in future THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Integrating in-situ Shear Rheology with Neutron Reflectometry for Structural and Dynamic Analysis of Interfacial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the structure and mechanical properties of complex fluid interfaces has gained increasing interest in recent decades as a result of its significant scientific relevance to the understanding of biological systems, drug development, and industrial applications. The in situ combination of molecular-level structural measurements with the assessment of dynamical (rheological) properties is particularly valuable, as comparing measurements conducted on separate samples under challenging-to-reproduce experimental conditions can be problematic. In this work, we present a new sample environment at the FIGARO instrument, the horizontal neutron reflectometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin, which includes an interfacial shear rheometer operating in the Double Wall-Ring (DWR) geometry, compatible with commercial rotational rheometers. This innovative setup enables simultaneous structural (neutron reflectometry) and dynamical (shear interfacial rheology) measurements on the same sample.</description>

      <title>Tunable transmissive metasurface based on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces hold great promise for spatial light modulation, and electro-optic tuning using lithium niobate is particularly attractive due to its high transparency and well-established thin-film platform. In this work, we present a free-space transmissive light modulator based on a seemingly un-patterned thin-film lithium niobate-on-insulator platform, integrated with a transparent conductive oxide meta-grating fabricated through a single lithography process. Guided mode resonance in the near-infrared region is induced with high mode confinement within lithium niobate layer, which directly in contact with the electrodes. A notable resonance shift of 0.38 nm is observed for the fundamental mode under +-10 V bias, while a maximum modulation amplitude of 4.6% is achieved for another higher-order mode. Incident angle is further exploited as another tuning parameter to split and sensitively shift the resonances. These results demonstrate the potential of this design for applications in compact, scalable, and tunable spatial light modulation devices.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Integrated Polarization-Insensitive LCoS for Projection Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) panels, renowned for their high resolution and fill-factor, are integral to modern projection displays. However, their inherent polarization sensitivity constrains the upper limit of light utilization, increases system complexity and restricts broader applicability. Here, we demonstrate a dual-layer metasurface-integrated LCoS prototype that achieves polarization-insensitive, addressable amplitude modulation in the visible. Polarization sensitivity is eliminated in the reflective architecture through polarization conversion in the underlying metasurface and polarization-sensitive phase modulation of the liquid crystals (LC). This is further enhanced by the electrically tunable subwavelength grating formed by the upper metasurface and LC, resulting in a high-contrast, polarization-insensitive optical switch. We showcase a 64-pixel 2D addressable prototype capable of generating diverse projection patterns with high contrast. Compatible with existing LCoS processes, our metasurface device reduces system size and enhances energy efficiency, offering applications in projectors and AR/VR displays, with the potential to redefine projection chip technology.</description>

      <title>New mechanism to enhance electron transverse transport by composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>

      <title>Visualizing hot carrier dynamics by nonlinear optical microscopy at the atomic length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing and manipulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of hot carriers in nanoscale metals is crucial to a plethora of applications ranging from nonlinear nanophotonics to single molecule photochemistry. The direct investigation of these highly non-equilibrium carriers requires the experimental capability of high energy resolution (~ meV) broadband femtosecond spectroscopy. When considering the ultimate limits of atomic scale structures, this capability has remained out of reach until date. Using a two color femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, we present here the real-time tracking of hot carrier dynamics in a well-defined plasmonic picocavity, formed in the tunnel junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The excitation of hot carriers in the picocavity enables ultrafast all optical control over the broadband (~ eV) anti Stokes electronic resonance Raman scattering (ERRS) and the four-wave mixing (FWM) signals generated at the atomic length scale. By mapping the ERRS and FWM signals from a single graphene nanoribbon (GNR), we demonstrate that both signals are more efficiently generated along the edges of the GNR: a manifestation of atomic-scale nonlinear optical microscopy. This demonstration paves the way to the development of novel ultrafast nonlinear picophotonic platforms, affording unique opportunities in a variety of contexts, from the direct investigation of non equilibrium light matter interactions in complex quantum materials, to the development of robust strategies for hot carriers harvesting in single molecules and the next generation of active metasurfaces with deep-sub-wavelength meta-atoms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength Selective Thermal Emission Enabled by Dual-Layer Localized Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal emission is a ubiquitous electromagnetic wave with an extreme broad spectrum in nature, and controlling thermal emission can be used to develop low-cost and convenient infrared light sources with wavelength tunable in a wide range that is currently difficult to other sources. Conventional metasurfaces are commonly used to control light but lack the flexibility to achieve complex emission spectral profiles and dynamic tuning. Here, we introduce a novel dual-layer metasurface structure with two completely independent layers to achieve a multi-peak thermal emission within the 5-8 {\mu}m wavelength range. Simulations and experiments show that this two-layer structure can achieve arbitrary spectral shapes without interfering with multiple resonant modes. This unique configuration presents a promising platform for further exploration in thermal emission engineering, enabling spectral control and dynamic tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip coherent laser sources are crucial for the future of photonic integrated circuits, yet progress has been hindered by the complex interplay between material quality, device geometry, and performance metrics. We combine high-throughput characterization, statistical analysis, experimental design, and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design process for low-threshold, high-yield III-V microring lasers with room-temperature operation at communication wavelengths. We demonstrate a 1.6$\times$ reduction in threshold over expert-designed configurations, achieving a 100% lasing yield that emits within the O-band with a median threshold as low as 33$\mu$J cm$^{-2}$ pulse$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical Derivatives for Efficient Mechanical Simulations of Hybrid Soft Rigid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms that use derivatives of governing equations have accelerated rigid robot simulations and improved their accuracy, enabling the modeling of complex, real-world capabilities. However, extending these methods to soft and hybrid soft-rigid robots is significantly more challenging due to the complexities in modeling continuous deformations inherent in soft bodies. A considerable number of soft robots and the deformable links of hybrid robots can be effectively modeled as slender rods. The Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) model, which employs the screw theory and the strain parameterization of the Cosserat rod, extends the rod theory to model hybrid soft-rigid robots within the same mathematical framework. Using the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm, we developed the analytical derivatives of the governing equations of the GVS model. These derivatives facilitate the implicit integration of dynamics and provide the analytical Jacobian of the statics residue, ensuring fast and accurate computations. We applied these derivatives to the mechanical simulations of six common robotic systems: a soft cable-driven manipulator, a hybrid serial robot, a fin-ray finger, a hybrid parallel robot, a contact scenario, and an underwater hybrid mobile robot. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with speed-ups of up to three orders of magnitude. We validate the model by comparing simulations done with and without analytical derivatives. Beyond static and dynamic simulations, the techniques discussed in this paper hold the potential to revolutionize the analysis, control, and optimization of hybrid robotic systems for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>PZT Optical Memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of new applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

      <title>Damage due to Ice Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freezing of water is one of the major causes of mechanical damage in materials during wintertime; surprisingly this happens even in situations where water only partially saturates the material so that the ice has room to grow. Here we perform freezing experiments in cylindrical glass vials of various sizes and wettability properties, using a dye that exclusively colors the liquid phase; this allows to precisely observe the freezing front. The visualization reveals that damage occurs in partially water-saturated media when a closed liquid inclusion forms within the ice due to the freezing of air/water meniscus. When this water inclusion subsequently freezes, the volume expansion leads to very high pressures leading to the fracture of both the surrounding ice and the glass vial. The pressure can be understood quantitatively based on thermodynamics which correctly predicts that the crystallization pressure is independent of the volume of the liquid pocket. Finally, our results also reveal that by changing the wetting properties of the confining walls, the formation of the liquid pockets that cause the mechanical damage can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced acousto-optic modulators on polymer-loaded lithium niobate integrated platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On chip acousto-optic (AO) modulation represents a significant advancement in the development of highly integrated information processing systems. However, conventional photonic devices face substantial challenges in achieving efficient conversion due to the limited overlap between acoustic waves and optical waves. In this study, we address this limitation by demonstrating an enhanced conversion effect of photonic crystal nanobeam cavities (PCNBCs) in AO modulation on a polymer-loaded lithium niobate integrated platform. Attributed to the high ratio of quality factor (Q) to mode volume (V) and optimal light-sound overlap within the nanocavity, PCNBCs-based AO modulator exhibits a significantly enhanced extinction ratio of 38 dB with a threshold RF power below -50 dBm, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that based on micro-ring resonator (MRRs). In addition, robust digital amplitude shift keying modulations using selected RF and optical channels of the PCNBCs-enhanced AO modulators. These findings validate the compelling properties of the PCNBCs photonic platform, establishing it as a promising candidate for on-chip integrated microwave photonics, optical transceivers, and computing applications.</description>

      <title>Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET Reliability Physics: From Four-State Model to All-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As implemented in the commercialized device modeling software, the four-state nonradiative multi-phonon model has attracted intensive attention in the past decade for describing the physics in negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and other reliability issues of Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET devices. It was proposed initially based on the assumption that the oxygen vacancy defects (V$_\text{O}$) in SiO$_\text{2}$ dielectric layer are bistable in the Si-dimer and back-projected structures during carrier capture and emission. Through high-throughput first-principles structural search, we found V$_\text{O}$ on non-equivalent O sites in amorphous SiO$_\text{2}$ can take 4 types of structural configurations in neutral state and 7 types of configurations in +1 charged state after capturing holes, which produce a wide range of charge-state transition levels for trapping holes. The finding contrasts the structural-bistability assumption and makes the four-state model invalid for most of O sites. To describe the reliability physics accurately, we propose an all-state model to consider all these structural configurations as well as all the carrier capture/emission transitions and thermal transitions between them. With the all-state model, we show that the V$_\text{O}$ defects play important roles in causing NBTI, which challenges the recent studies that discarded V$_\text{O}$ as a possible hole trap in NBTI. Our systematical calculations on the diversified V$_\text{O}$ properties and the all-state model provide the microscopic foundation for describing the reliability physics of MOSFETs and other transistors accurately.</description>

      <title>Terahertz generation via all-optical quantum control in 2D and 3D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using optical technology for current injection and electromagnetic emission simplifies the comparison between materials. Here, we inject current into monolayer graphene and bulk gallium arsenide (GaAs) using two-color quantum interference and detect the emitted electric field by electro-optic sampling. We find the amplitude of emitted terahertz (THz) radiation scales in the same way for both materials even though they differ in dimension, band gap, atomic composition, symmetry and lattice structure. In addition, we observe the same mapping of the current direction to the light characteristics. With no electrodes for injection or detection, our approach will allow electron scattering timescales to be directly measured. We envisage that it will enable exploration of new materials suitable for generating terahertz magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum limited imaging of a nanomechanical resonator with a spatial mode sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of a spatial mode sorter to image a nanomechanical resonator, with the goal of studying the quantum limits of active imaging and extending the toolbox for optomechanical force sensing. In our experiment, we reflect a Gaussian laser beam from a vibrating nanoribbon and pass the reflected beam through a commercial spatial mode demultiplexer (Cailabs Proteus). The intensity in each demultiplexed channel depends on the mechanical mode shapes and encodes information about their displacement amplitudes. As a concrete demonstration, we monitor the angular displacement of the ribbon's fundamental torsion mode by illuminating in the fundamental Hermite-Gauss mode (HG$_{00}$) and reading out in the HG$_{01}$ mode. We show that this technique permits readout of the ribbon's torsional vibration with a precision near the quantum limit. Our results highlight new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Topology Optimization for the Full-Cell Design of Porous Electrodes in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a density-based topology optimization framework to design porous electrodes for maximum energy storage. We simulate the full cell with a model that incorporates electronic potential, ionic potential, and electrolyte concentration. The system consists of three materials, namely pure liquid electrolyte and the porous solids of the anode and cathode, for which we determine the optimal placement. We use separate electronic potentials to model each electrode, which allows interdigitated designs. As a result, a penalization is required to ensure that the anode and cathode do not touch, i.e., causing a short circuit. We compare multiple 2D designs generated for different fixed conditions, e.g. material properties. A 3D design with complex channel and interlocked structure is also created. All optimized designs are far superior to the traditional monolithic electrode design with respect to energy storage metrics. We observe up to a 750% increase in energy storage for cases with slow effective ionic diffusion within the porous electrode.</description>

      <title>GEM: A GEneral Memristive Transistor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic devices, with their distinct advantages in energy efficiency and parallel processing, are pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence applications. Among these devices, memristive transistors have attracted significant attention due to their superior stability and operation flexibility compared to two-terminal memristors. However, the lack of a robust model that accurately captures their complex electrical behavior has hindered further exploration of their potential. In this work, we introduce the GEneral Memristive transistor (GEM) model to address this challenge. The GEM model incorporates time-dependent differential equation, a voltage-controlled moving window function, and a nonlinear current output function, enabling precise representation of both switching and output characteristics in memristive transistors. Compared to previous models, the GEM model demonstrates a 300% improvement in modeling the switching behavior, while effectively capturing the inherent nonlinearities and physical limits of these devices. This advancement significantly enhances the realistic simulation of memristive transistors, thereby facilitating further exploration and application development.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Model for a Full Fusion Tokamak Enabled by Supercomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining stress and strain in a component of a fusion power plant involves defining boundary conditions for the mechanical equilibrium equations, implying the availability of a full reactor model for defining those conditions. To address this fundamental challenge of reactor design, a finite element method (FEM) model for the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak Upgrade (MAST-U) fusion tokamak, operating at the Culham Campus of UKAEA, has been developed and applied to assess mechanical deformations, strain, and stress in the full tokamak structure, taken as a proxy for a fusion power plant. The model, handling 127 million finite elements using about 800 processors in parallel, illustrates the level of fidelity of structural simulations of a complex nuclear device made possible by the modern supercomputing systems. The model predicts gravitational and atmospheric pressure-induced deformations in broad agreement with observations, and enables computing the spectrum of acoustic vibrations of a tokamak, arising from mechanical disturbances like an earthquake or a plasma disruption. We introduce the notion of the density of stress to characterise the distribution of stress in the entire solid body of the tokamak, and to predict the magnitude and locations of stress concentrations. The model enables defining computational requirements for simulating a whole operating fusion power plant, and provides a digital foundation for the assessment of reactor performance as well as for specifying the relevant materials testing programme.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650{\deg}C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Improved precision and accuracy of electron energy-loss spectroscopy quantification via fine structure fitting with constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fault-tolerant Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. Furthermore, we explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Upconversion of Phonon Modes into Microwave Photons in a Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonator Coupled to a Microwave Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between acoustic vibrations in a lithium niobate bulk acoustic wave resonator and microwave photons of a re-entrant microwave cavity was investigated at a temperature close to 4 K. Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric "split-post" configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.</description>
