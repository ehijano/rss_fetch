      <title>Review of contact models used in Discrete Element Method (DEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed review of the methods proposed to implement Mindlin's no-slip and partial slip model under constant normal loading and Mindlin Deresiewicz's extensional work on micro-slip under varying normal loading, for the simulation of granular flow. Various methods that followed Mindlin's and Mindlin and Deresiewicz's approaches for modeling the tangential contact between two spherical particles are reviewed thoroughly, first, to understand the tangential load-displacement behaviour and finally to compare the tangential coefficient of restitution obtained from each of these models with the experimentally determined values reported in the literature. The tangential load-displacement behaviour obtained from the integral method is qualitatively different from that determined by the incremental method, which accounts for the loading history. Tangential and rotational coefficient of restitution in the gross sliding regime obtained from all the models show excellent agreement with the experimental result, but in the sticking regime, the agreement is only qualitative.</description>

      <title>Selective band engineering of Bi/Si(111) by boron segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin layers of metals deposited on semiconductors display a variety of physical properties such as superconductivity, charge density waves, topological phases, strong spin-orbit (Rashba) splitting, among others. To access these exotic phases and induce new ones, it is necessary to control and tune the energies of the electronic states of those heterostructures. In this work we investigate the engineering of the band structure of the two-dimensional Bi/Si(111) $\beta$-phase using a modulation doping approach based on boron segregation at the surface. We demonstrate that the Bi-induced Rashba bands can be displaced in energy by up to 200 meV without altering their strong Rashba parameter. Importantly, while the Bi states shift upward, the underlying Si valence states remain essentially fixed, which rules out a simple band-bending scenario. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the displacement originates from changes in the hybridization of Si states near the surface, induced by the presence of B atoms. This selective mechanism halves the distance of the Rashba-split states from the Fermi level, opening the way to their exploitation in transport and spintronic devices and highlighting the broader potential of modulation doping as a band-engineering strategy for two-dimensional metals on semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Glass transition in colloidal monolayers controlled by light-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the glass-transition problem for a quasi-two-dimensional colloidal dense suspension modulated by a one-dimensional periodic external potential as imposed by interfering laser beams. Relying on a mode-coupling approach, we examine the nonequilibrium state diagram for hard disks as a function of the density and the period of the modulation for various potential strengths. The competition between the local packing and the distortion of the cages induced by the potential leads to a striking nonmonotonic behavior of the glass-transition line which allows melting of a glass state merely by changing the external fields. In particular, we find regions in the non-equilibrium state diagram where a moderate periodic modulation stabilizes the liquid state.</description>

      <title>Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it was shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <title>Metallic $p$-wave magnet with commensurate spin helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</description>
