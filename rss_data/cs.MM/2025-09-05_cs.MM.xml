      <title>ResearchPulse: Building Method-Experiment Chains through Multi-Document Scientific Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation, methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task, we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents, consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/ResearchPulse/ResearchPulse-Bench.</description>

      <title>Promisedland: An XR Narrative Attraction Integrating Diorama-to-Virtual Workflow and Elemental Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Promisedland is a mixed-reality (MR) narrative attraction that combines cultural storytelling, ecological education, and an innovative hybrid production workflow. Set in a future Earth suffering from elemental imbalance, users embark on an interactive journey guided by symbolic characters to restore harmony through the collection of five classical elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. To prototype this experience, we introduce a low-cost, high-fidelity Diorama-to-Virtual pipeline - handcrafting physical scale models, 3D scanning, and integrating them into Unreal Engine. This process enables rapid spatial prototyping while preserving the material expressiveness and narrative consistency of the physical environment. To further enhance immersion, the experience incorporates a Stewart Platform to provide motion feedback synchronized with the virtual ride dynamics, reinforcing spatial presence and embodied engagement. The final prototype runs on Meta Quest, supporting dynamic interactions and real-time visual feedback. Promisedland offers a replicable design blueprint for future XR narrative installations across museums, cultural exhibitions, and themed entertainment. It proposes a new framework for XR Narrative Attractions - where physical and digital elements converge to deepen immersion, agency, and emotional engagement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its first iteration in 2018, the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) continues to rise in popularity as an interactive lifelog data retrieval competition, co-located at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR). The goal of this annual live event is to search a large corpus of lifelogging data for specifically announced memories using a purposefully developed tool within a limited amount of time. As long-standing participants, we present our improved lifeXplore - a retrieval system combining chronologic day summary browsing with interactive combinable concept filtering. Compared to previous versions, the tool is improved by incorporating temporal queries, advanced day summary features as well as usability improvements.</description>

      <title>Designing Effective AI Explanations for Misinformation Detection: A Comparative Study of Content, Social, and Combined Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of AI explanation of misinformation, where the goal is to identify explanation designs that help improve users' misinformation detection abilities and their overall user experiences. Our work is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as "social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations influence misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>Human Motion Video Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models examined in this survey is available in Our Repository https://github.com/Winn1y/Awesome-Human-Motion-Video-Generation.</description>

      <title>TEn-CATS: Text-Enriched Audio-Visual Video Parsing with Multi-Scale Category-Aware Temporal Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.</description>

      <title>PianoBind: A Multimodal Joint Embedding Model for Pop-piano Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses significant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across genres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music, expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music, achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.</description>

      <title>TRUST-VL: An Explainable News Assistant for General Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</description>

      <title>PIN: A Knowledge-Intensive Dataset for Paired and Interleaved Multimodal Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have leveraged extensive multimodal datasets to enhance capabilities in complex knowledge-driven tasks. However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. To address these issues, we introduce PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), a novel data format designed to foster a deeper integration of visual and textual knowledge. The PIN format uniquely combines semantically rich Markdown files, which preserve fine-grained textual structures, with holistic overall images that capture the complete document layout. Following this format, we construct and release two large-scale, open-source datasets: PIN-200M (~200 million documents) and PIN-14M (~14 million), compiled from diverse web and scientific sources in both English and Chinese. To maximize usability, we provide detailed statistical analyses and equip the datasets with quality signals, enabling researchers to easily filter and select data for specific tasks. Our work provides the community with a versatile data format and substantial resources, offering a foundation for new research in pre-training strategies and the development of more powerful knowledge-intensive LMMs.</description>

      <title>Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</description>

      <title>SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongBloom_demo. The code and model weights have been released on https://github.com/Cypress-Yang/SongBloom .</description>
