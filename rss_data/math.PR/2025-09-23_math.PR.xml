      <title>Bilinear Differential-Difference Equations and One-Point Distributions of Some KPZ-Class Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a collection of nonlinear integrable partial differential-difference equations that are satisfied by the one-point distribution functions of some classical integrable KPZ models. Moreover, these equations can be regarded as reparametrizations or as scaling limits of the Hirota bilinear difference equation (HBDE), a canonical discretization for many important integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, and the two-dimensional Toda lattice (2DTL). Our contributions are threefold: (i) general Fredholm determinant solutions; (ii) verification that known formulas for classical integrable KPZ models fit within our framework; and (iii) zero-curvature/Lax pair formulations. As an application, we derive formal scaling limits of the equations, including the KP limit under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling.</description>

      <title>Mixtures, Markov bridges and the matrix product ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a probabilistic characterization of the set of measures that can be represented by the matrix product ansatz. By suitably enlarging the state space, we show that a probability measure can be described in terms of non negative matrices by the {\it Matrix Product Ansatz}, if and only if it can be written as a mixture of inhomogeneous product measures where the mixing law is a Markov bridge. We give a constructive procedure to identify such probabilistic features. We illustrate the result by examples and show that existing probabilistic representations of the invariant measures of non equilibrium interacting particle systems can be obtained from the matrix product ansatz by this general procedure.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Bootstrap Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study two variants of two-stage growth dynamics in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with state space $\{0,1,2\}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$. In each variant, vertices in state $0$ can be changed irreversibly to state $1$, and vertices in state $1$ can be changed permanently to state $2$. In the standard variant, a vertex flips from state $i$ to $i+1$ if it has at least two nearest-neighbors in state $i+1$. In the modified variant, a $0$ changes to a $1$ if it has both a north or south neighbor and an east or west neighbor in state $1$, and a $1$ changes to a $2$ if it has at least two nearest-neighbors in state $2$. We assume that the initial configuration is given by a product measure with small probabilities $p$ and $q$ of $1$s and $2$s. For both variants, as $p$ and $q$ tend to $0$, if $q$ is large compared to $p^{2+o(1)}$, then the final density of $0$s tends to $1$. When $q$ is small compared to $p^{2+o(1)}$, for standard variant the final density of $2$s tends to $1$, while for the modified variant the final density of $1$s tends to $1$. In fact, for the modified variant, the final density of $2$s approaches $0$ regardless of the relative size of $q$ versus $p$. These results remain unchanged if, in either variant, a $1$ changes to a $2$ only if it has both a north or south neighbor and an east or west neighbor in state $2$. An essential feature of these dynamics is that they are not monotone in the initial configuration.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for two-dimensional directed polymers with critical spatial correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the 1+2 dimensional lattice, we consider a directed polymer in a random Gaussian environment that is independent in time and correlated in space. The spatial correlation is supposed to decay as $(\log |x|)^a /|x|^{2}$, $a&gt;-1$, where the square in the polynomial is known to be critical (Lacoin, Ann. Prob. (2011)). We introduce an intermediate regime of temperature $\beta_N \propto \hat \beta/(\log N)^{\frac{a+2}{2}}$, under which the log-partition function $\log W_N^{\beta_N}$ converges in distribution towards a Gaussian random variable if $\hat \beta\in (0,\hat \beta_c)$, whereas $W_N^{\beta_N}$ vanishes for $\hat \beta\geq \hat \beta_c$. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution, which is given by an inverse Bessel function, is determined by an induction scheme whose multi-scale dependence reflects the critical nature of the correlation. The Gaussianity of the limit follows from a decoupling argument of Cosco, Donadini (2024+).</description>

      <title>Abrupt decorrelation for linear stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how a system loses memory of its initial state is a central problem in probability and statistics. In this manuscript, we introduce the notion of abrupt decorrelation, which explicitly characterises a sharp and sudden loss of correlation over time. We study this phenomenon within a class of linear stochastic differential equations (LSDEs), where explicit descriptions are available under various statistical distances. Our main focus is on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while in the one-dimensional case we extend the analysis to LSDEs with time-dependent drifts. The results highlight strong parallels with the cut-off phenomenon in Markov processes and contribute to a broader understanding of decorrelation in stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary Feller-Dynkin processes associated with Laguerre processes and Pickrell diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a Feller-Dynkin boundary process by applying the method of intertwiners to the coherent family, introduced in our previous work, of Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter. The corresponding boundary process is computed explicitly, and it turns out to be a deterministic dynamical system. Since the Pickrell diffusions that leave the Pickrell measure invariant are coherent with respect to the same projective system, we also obtain the stochastic boundary process associated with the coherent family of Pickrell diffusions.</description>

      <title>The invariant measure of nonlinear McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the invariant measure of McKean-Vlasov (MV) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with common noise (wCN) whose coefficients depend on both the state and the measure. Using the existence of the unique solution of the corresponding stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), we give the strong/weak existence and uniqueness of the couple of the solution and its conditional distribution of the MV-SDEwCN. Then we construct a complete product measure space under given distance and an operator acting on the measure couple of the solution. By the help of the semigroup property of the operators, we establish the existence of the unique invariant measure for the solution couple of the MV-SDEwCN, whose coefficients grow polynomially. Then we establish the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos and give the convergence rate of the measure couple of one single particle and the empirical measure of the interacting particle system to the underlying invariant measure. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate our main results.</description>

      <title>On certain integral functionals of integer-valued subordinators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the exponential functional of a Poisson process admits a probability density function in the form of an infinite series. In this paper, we obtain an explicit expression for the density function of the exponential functional of any integer-valued subordinator, and by extension, limit representations for that of an arbitrary pure-jump subordinator. With an added positive drift, the density function is expressed via piecewise basis functions governed by a functional relation. Closed-form density functions for these cases have been established only for a few special instances of L\'{e}vy processes in the past literature. Our work substantially advances this line of research by providing an analytical perspective on the distribution of a broad class of exponential L\'{e}vy functionals, also suggesting potential methodological extensions to general purely discontinuous L\'{e}vy processes. Moreover, we consider arbitrary decreasing functionals of integer-valued subordinators by deriving sufficient and necessary conditions for their convergence, which are then applied to obtain limit-series representations for the density functions of inverse-power functionals. The numerical performance of the proposed formulae is demonstrated through various examples of well-known distributions.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture of Schilling Regarding the Coupon Collector's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses a conjecture by Schilling concerning the optimality of the uniform distribution in the generalized Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) where, in each round, a subset (package) of $s$ coupons is drawn from a total of $n$ distinct coupons. While the classical CCP (with single-coupon draws) is well understood, the group-draw variant - where packages of size $s$ are drawn - presents new challenges and has applications in areas such as biological network models.
  Schilling conjectured that, for $2 \leq s \leq n-1$, the uniform distribution over all possible packages minimizes the expected number of rounds needed to collect all coupons if and only if $s = n-1$. We prove Schilling's conjecture in full by presenting, for all other values of $s$, "natural" non-uniform distributions yielding strictly lower expected collection times. Explicit formulas and asymptotic analyses are provided for the expected number of rounds under these and related distributions.
  The article further explores the behavior of the expected collection time as $s$ varies under the uniform distribution, including the cases where $s$ is constant, proportional to $n$, or nearly $n$.

      <title>Non-directed polymers in random environments with range penalties: the high dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up work of arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949. We study a non-directed polymer model in random environments. The polymer is represented by a simple symmetric random walk $S$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq2$ and the random environment is represented by i.i.d. heavy-tailed random variables with their tail probability decaying polynomially. We perform a Gibbs transform to describe the interaction between polymers and random environments. Up to time $N$, the law of $S$ is tilted by $\exp(\sum_{x\in\mathcal{R}_N}(\beta\omega_x-h))$, where $\mathcal{R}_N$ is the range of $S$ up to time $N$, $\beta\geq0$ is the inverse temperature and $h\in\mathbb{R}$ is an external field. By tuning $\beta=\beta_N$ and $h=h_N$, we establish the phase diagram and study the fluctuations of $S$ under the Gibbs transform and the scaling limits of the (logarithmic) partition function. The novelty and challenge, compared to arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949, is that we also tune the external field $h$, which brings in various range penalties, unlike in arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949, where $h$ is fixed and merely playing a role of centering for the random environment.</description>

      <title>It\^o formula for reduced rough paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The It\^o formula, also known as the change-of-variables formula, is a cornerstone of It\^o stochastic calculus. Over time, this formula has been extended to apply to random processes for which classical calculus is insufficient. Since every random process exhibits some degree of regularity, rough path theory provides a natural framework for treating them uniformly. In this paper, we extend the It\^o formula for reduced rough paths, broadening the range of roughness from the previously known case $\frac{1}{3} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ to the more singular regime $\frac{1}{4} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures II: Tail profile of bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures in the exact scale-invariant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of a series of papers where we consider questions related to the tail profile of the bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures appearing in boundary Liouville conformal field theory. In this part, we study of the right tail profile of a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary, especially in the case of an exact scale-invariant kernel for the underlying log-correlated Gaussian field. This extends previous results by Rhodes-Vargas and Wong, where the case with flat background geometry (i.e. no boundary singularity) is studied using either the localization trick or some suitable versions of Tauberian theorems. Our generalization is non-trivial in the sense that we don't apply the localization trick to the bulk measure in question, but rather to an auxiliary Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure located at the boundary, on which the original bulk measure is not directly defined. We show that this modified localization scheme correctly captures the behavior of the right tail of the bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. The resulting tail profile coefficient is expressed in terms of a variant of bulk/boundary quotient of respective Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures, for which the well-definedness follows from preliminary joint moment bounds established previously in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Metastability for telegraph processes in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equations with nonlinearity in the form of a double-well potential, randomised by a velocity-switching (telegraph) stochastic process. If the speed parameters of the randomisation are small, then this dynamics has one metastable uncertainty interval and two invariant attractors. The probabilities of leaving the metastable interval through the upper boundary are determined, as well as characteristics of the first crossing times. Invariant measures are also found. When and if the direction of the telegraph process velocity coincides with the direction of the periodic change in potential, the system can go into a metastable state, having received a time window for the interwell transition. The obtained results can be used as an alternative to stochastic resonance models.</description>

      <title>Stationary fluctuations for occupation times of the long-range voter models on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the long-range voter model on lattices. We prove a stationary fluctuation theorem for the occupation time of the model under a proper time-space scaling. In several cases, the fluctuation limits are driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameters in $(1/2, 1)$. The proof of our main result utilizes the martingale decomposition strategy introduced in \cite{Kipnis1987}. A local central limit theorem of the long-range random walk, the duality relationship between the model and the long-range coalescing random walk and a fluctuation theorem of the empirical density field of the model play the key roles in the proof.</description>

      <title>The randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a G-randomly distorted capacity and risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a capacity c on a measurable space ({\Omega},F), where the capacity c is distorted by a G-measurable random distortion function (with G a sub-{\sigma}-algebra of F). We establish some fundamental properties, including the comonotonic additivity of these integrals under suitable assumptions on the underlying capacity space. We provide a representation result for comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the first-order stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c) in terms of these randomly distorted Choquet integrals. We also present the case where the random distortion functions are concave. In this case, the G-randomly distorted Choquet integrals are characterised in terms of comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the stop-loss stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c). We provide examples, extending some well-known risk measures in finance and insurance, such as the Value at Risk and the Average Value at Risk.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of integrated fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a canonical model for long-memory phenomena. In the presence of large amounts of potentially memory-bearing data, the data are often averaged, which can change the structure of the underlying relationships and affect standard estimation procedures. To address this, we introduce the normalized integrated fractional Brownian motion (nifBm), defined as the average of fBm over a fixed interval. We derive its covariance structure, investigate the stationarity and self-similarity, and extend the framework to linear combinations of independent nifBms and models with deterministic drift. For such linear combinations, we establish stationarity of increments, investigate the asymptotic behavior of the autocovariance function, and prove an ergodic theorem essential for statistical inference. We consider two statistical models: one driven by a single nifBm and another by a linear combination of two independent nifBms, including cases with deterministic drift. For both models, we propose estimators that are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal for both the drift and the full parameter set. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings, providing a foundation for modeling averaged fractional dynamics, with potential applications in finance, energy markets, and environmental studies.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian limits for diameter and perimeter of convex hulls of multiple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove large-time $L^2$ and distributional limit theorems for perimeter and diameter of the convex hull of $N$ trajectories of planar random walks whose increments have finite second moments. Earlier work considered $N \in \{1,2\}$ and showed that, for generic configurations of the mean drifts of the walks, limits are Gaussian. For perimeter, we complete the picture for $N=2$ by showing that the exceptional cases are all non-Gaussian, with limits involving an It\^o integral (two walks with the same non-zero drift) or a geometric functional of Brownian motion (one walk with zero drift and one with non-zero drift), and establish Gaussian limits for generic configurations when $N \geq 3$. For the diameter we obtain a complete picture for $N \geq 2$, with limits (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) described explicitly in terms of the drift configuration. Our approach unifies old and new results in an $L^2$-approximation framework that provides a multivariate extension of Wald's maximal central limit theorem for one-dimensional random walk, and gives certain best-possible approximation results for the convex hull in Hausdorff sense. We also provide variance asymptotics and limiting variances are described explicitly.</description>

      <title>Edge-reinforced branching random walk on a triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge-reinforced random walk (ERRW) is a random process on the vertices of a graph that is more likely to cross the edges it has visited in the past. Depending on the strength of the reinforcement, the ERRW of a single particle can either exhibit localisation (eventually moving back and forth across a single edge) or remain transient. We consider a model where a single ERRW is replaced by that of an exponentially growing number of random particles, and we study its localisation properties on the triangle. Using the dynamical systems approach we analyse the frequencies with which the edges are traversed and prove their almost sure convergence. We discuss the scenarios when those frequencies become negligible for one or two edges (dominance). We also discuss the situation when an edge stops being traversed entirely (monopoly).</description>

      <title>Density convergence on Markov diffusion chaos via Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the difference between the probability density of a random variable $F$ on Markov diffusion chaos and the probability density of a general target distribution $Z$. In the special case where $F$ is a chaotic random variables and $Z$ is a Pearson target, we extend our study to the $k$-th derivatives of the densities for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$. In particular, we obtain four moment theorems for the convergence of the $k$-th derivatives of the densities of $F$ to the corresponding $k$-th derivatives of the density of a Pearson target. Our work therefore significantly extends earlier works [HLN14,BDH24] which studies density convergence of random variables on Wiener chaos to respectively the normal and Gamma targets.
  We provide two applications of our results. The first application is about weighted sum of i.i.d. Gamma distribution where we show convergence in laws of this weighted sum to another Gamma distribution automatically implies convergence in densities. In the second application, we show that for a large class of Pearson diffusions, the density of its solution with any initial condition exponentially converge to its limiting density. Moreover, this exponential convergence holds for the $k$-th derivatives of the densities for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the phase transition of the Parisi formula for the free energy in the multi-species Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model with a centered Gaussian external field and a positive-semidefinite variance profile matrix. We show that in terms of the strength of the external field and the variance profile, the de Almeida--Thouless surface delineates the boundary between replica symmetric solutions and replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

Abstract: An $r$-sunflower is a collection of $r$ sets such that the intersection of any two sets in the collection is identical. We analyze a random process which constructs a $w$-uniform $r$-sunflower free family starting with an empty family and at each step adding a set chosen uniformly at random from all choices that could be added without creating an $r$-sunflower with the previously chosen sets. To analyze this process, we extend results of the first author and Bohman arXiv:1308.3732v5 [math.CO], who analyzed a general random process which adds one object at a time chosen uniformly at random from all objects that can be added without creating certain forbidden subsets.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo on a single sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Eyring-Kramers formula for the mean exit time of non-Gibbsian elliptic processes: the non characteristic boundary case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new sharp asymptotic equivalent in the small temperature regime $h\to 0$ for the mean exit time from a bounded domain for the non-reversible process $dX\_t=b(X\_t)dt + \sqrt h \, dB\_t$ under a generic orthogonal decomposition of $b$ and when the boundary of $\Omega$ is assumed to be \textit{non characteristic}. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that we do not assume that the process $(X\_t,t\ge 0)$ is \textit{Gibbsian}. In this case, a new correction term characterizing the \textit{non-Gibbsianness} of the process appears in the equivalent of the mean exit time. The proof is mainly based on tools from spectral and semi-classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Cram\'er-Rao Bound And Its Variants: An Extrinsic Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric refinement of the classical Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) by incorporating curvature-aware corrections based on the second fundamental form associated with the statistical model manifold. That is, our formulation shows that relying on the extrinsic geometry of the square root embedding of the manifold in the ambient Hilbert space comprising square integrable functions with respect to a fixed base measure offers a rigorous (and intuitive) way to improve upon the CRB and some of its variants, such as the Bhattacharyya-type bounds, that use higher-order derivatives of the log-likelihood. Precisely, the improved bounds in the latter case make explicit use of the elegant framework offered by employing the Fa\`a di Bruno formula and exponential Bell polynomials in expressing the jets associated with the square root embedding in terms of the raw scores. The interplay between the geometry of the statistical embedding and the behavior of the estimator variance is quantitatively analyzed in concrete examples, showing that our corrections can meaningfully tighten the lower bound, suggesting further exploration into connections with estimator efficiency in more general situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior for fully coupled multiscale stochastic systems becomes much complicated when the fast processes do not locate in a compact space. An example is constructed to show that the averaged coefficients may become discontinuous even they are originally Lipschitz continuous when the fast process locate in a noncompact space. This work aims to reveal the impact of ergodicity of the fast process on the establishment of the averaging principle. The crucial point is to characterize the continuous dependence of the invariant probability measure on parameters related to the slow process with respect to various distances in the Wasserstein space.</description>

Abstract: We prove Russo-Seymour-Welsh type crossing estimates for the FK-Ising model on general s-embeddings whose origami map has an asymptotic Lipschitz constant strictly smaller than $1$, provided a mild non-degeneracy assumption is satisfied. This result extends the original work of Chelkak and provides a general framework to prove that connection probabilities between boundaries of boxes remain bounded away from $0$ and $1$. It is explained that one cannot prove similar estimates without a similar assumption on the origami map, and allows to propose some notion of critical model for generic planar graphs, that can be rephrased from the perspective of the associated propagator operator. This paper reproves along the way corresponding results in almost all already known setups and also treats new ones of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Non-homogeneous Generalized Skellam process (NGSP) and its fractional version NGFSP by time changing it with an independent inverse stable subordinator. We study distributional properties for NGSP and NGFSP including probability generating function, probability mass function (p.m.f.), factorial moments, mean, variance, covariance and correlation structure. Then we investigate the long and short range dependence structures for NGSP and NGFSP, and obtain the governing state differential equations of these processes along with their increment processes. We obtain recurrence relations satisfied by the state probabilities of Non-homogeneous generalized counting process (NGCP), NGSP and NGFSP. The weighted sum representations for these processes are provided. We further obtain martingale and renewal properties along with arrival time distribution for NGSP and NGFSP. An alternative version of NGFSP with a closed-form p.m.f. is introduced along with a discussion of its distributional and asymptotic properties. In addition, we study the running average processes of GCP and GSP which are of independent interest. The p.m.f. of NGSP and the simulated sample paths of GFSP, NGFSP and related processes are plotted. Finally, we discuss an application to a high-frequency financial data set pointing out the advantages of our model compared to existing ones.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum and Minimum of a Multivariate Poisson Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the maximum and minimum of multivariate Poisson distributions with three dependence structures, namely, the common shock, comonotonic shock and thinning-dependence models. In particular, we formulate the definition of a thinning-dependent multivariate Poisson distribution based on Wang and Yuen (2005). We derive explicit CDFs of the maximum and minimum of the multivariate Poisson random vectors and conduct asymptotic analyses on them. Our results reveal the substantial difference between the three dependence structures for multivariate Poisson distribution and may suggest an alternative method for studying the dependence for other multivariate distributions. We further provide numerical examples demonstrating obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an elementary proof of quantitative uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model under sufficiently strong interaction. The idea is to combine existing finite-time propagation of chaos estimates with existing uniform-in-time stability estimates for the interacting particle system, in order to obtain a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos estimate with an explicit rate of convergence in the number of particles. This is achieved via a method that is similar in spirit to the classical 'stability + consistency implies convergence' approach in numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study reflecting Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting. After providing a probabilistic description of the phenomenon using jump diffusions and semigroups, we analyze the time-reversed process starting from the stationary measure. We prove that the time-reversed process is a Brownian motion with a negative drift and non-local boundary conditions at zero. Moreover, we further study the time-reversed process between two consecutive resetting points and show that, within this time window, it behaves as the same reflecting Brownian motion with a negative drift, where both the jump sizes and the time spent at zero coincide with those of the process obtained under the stationary measure. We characterize the dynamics of both processes, their local times, and finally investigate elliptic problems on positive half-spaces, showing that the two processes leave the same traces at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.</description>

Abstract: The density conjecture for activated random walk on the interval was recently resolved using a new tool called layer percolation. As a step towards understanding how layer percolation extends to activated random walk on more complex graphs, we develop its analog for the comb graph and use it to prove bounds on the critical density. Additionally, we provide simulation evidence suggesting that the comb has different critical densities on its spine and teeth, both of which are smaller than the critical density for the interval.</description>

      <title>Factoring the Laplacian to understand topological polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ring polymer is a random walk whose steps obey a single linear condition; their sum vanishes. Factoring the graph Laplacian into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose allows us to show that for a more complicated network, the steps must lie in a linear subspace determined by the graph topology. This provides a useful new perspective on the James--Guth theory of phantom elastic networks. In particular, we formulate phantom networks which are free from the constraints of fixed crosslinks. For a given network the solution of the loop constraints makes the partition function finite-valued in the path integral formulation without applying any external forces or fixing any monomer positions. The resulting probability distribution on edge displacements is rotationally invariant, which is practically quite useful for generating unbiased random samples of edge displacements and monomer positions. Furthermore, one can exactly calculate many physical quantities such as correlation functions with respect to this distribution. Finally, this reformulation lends itself well to the case of non-Gaussian distributions. We illustrate this by computing the expected radius of gyration of a ring polymer in a wide variety of models.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1] considered spin glass models with additional conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties. These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.</description>

Abstract: This short course offers a new perspective on randomized algorithms for matrix computations. It explores the distinct ways in which probability can be used to design algorithms for numerical linear algebra. Each design template is illustrated by its application to several computational problems. This treatment establishes conceptual foundations for randomized numerical linear algebra, and it forges links between algorithms that may initially seem unrelated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of consensus formation in the Deffuant model for social interaction, we consider the following procedure on a graph $G$. Initially, there is one unit of tea at a fixed vertex $r \in V(G)$, and all other vertices have no tea. At any time in the procedure, we can choose a connected subset of vertices $T$ and equalize the amount of tea among vertices in $T$. We prove that if $x \in V(G)$ is at distance $d$ from $r$, then $x$ will have at most $\frac{1}{d+1}$ units of tea during any step of the procedure. This bound is best possible and answers a question of Gantert.
  We also consider arbitrary initial weight distributions. For every finite graph $G$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$, we prove that the set of weight distributions reachable from $w$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
  This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
  Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>

      <title>Simulating Posterior Bayesian Neural Networks with Dependent Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an algorithm to sample from the network. In the shallow case we explicitly compute the distribution of the conditional output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the theoretical results are numerically validated.</description>

      <title>On the geometric Brownian motion with state-dependent variable exponent diffusion term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates. A detailed comparison of the It\^o and Stratonovich interpretations for the proposed model is presented in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Two-Strain Epidemic Dynamics on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a discrete-time two-strain symbiotic epidemic model on complex networks with both random and long-range interactions. Our analysis examines how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the long-range decay exponent ($\alpha$), and the scale-free connectivity exponent ($\gamma$) shape epidemic persistence under cooperative dynamics. Comparison with a two-strain competition model shows how these parameters control strain dominance, coexistence, or extinction. The results demonstrate that contagion dynamics are strongly affected by environmental randomness and long-range couplings. In facultative symbiosis, the co-infection recovery rate undergoes a clear phase transition, separating persistence from extinction. In the competitive setting, regimes with $\alpha &lt; 2$ and $\gamma &lt; 3$ markedly lower the epidemic threshold, allowing persistence even at small contagion rates ($\sigma$). Statistical analysis further reveals that $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ exert pronounced, nonlinear, and time-dependent effects on strain survival.</description>

      <title>Matrix harmonic analysis at high temperature via the Dirichlet process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, we show that the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Fourier/Mellin transform of a measure, which and the limiting empirical distribution are intimately related by the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence can be studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</description>
