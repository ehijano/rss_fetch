      <title>The minimal counterexample to James's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Geordie Williamson proved the existence of counterexamples to James's conjecture on the decomposition matrices of symmetric groups and their Hecke algebras. The smallest counterexample detectable by Williamson's method occurs in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ for $n=1 \thinspace 744 \thinspace 860$, in characteristic $p=2237$. Those detected by Williamson remain the only known counterexamples to James's conjecture. In this work, we calculate an explicit new counterexample, occurring in the principal block of the Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{24}$ when $q$ is a primitive fourth root of unity, and give explicit graded decomposition numbers in this case. This is the minimal rank counterexample for $e\neq 2$.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of Augmentation Submodules in Monoids with 0-Minimal Ideals of Rank Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct explicit families of transformation monoids whose augmentation submodules are simple and whose associated 0-minimal $\J$-classes have rank greater than two. These examples provide new monoids with simple augmentation submodules and non-complete associated graphs. We also establish a connection between the sandwich matrix of a 0-minimal $\J$-class of rank two and the simplicity of the corresponding augmentation module, yielding a criterion that determines simplicity directly from the rank of this matrix for this class of monoids.</description>

      <title>Conjugation Theorem For Affine Kac-Moody Superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a conjugacy Theorem of Cartan subalgebras, originally established for symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, to the broader context of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras. Along the way, we obtain several results that deepen our understanding of the structure of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras. Additionally, we achieve findings regarding the relations within the imaginary root spaces of symmetrizable affine Kac-Moody superalgebras, providing new insights into their algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>A Scattering Transform for Noncommutative Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Flow cones of graphs with cycles and locally gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow cones of a directed acyclic graph admit a family of unimodular triangulations given by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy (DKK) whose normal fans are related to (generalizations) of the associahedron and permutahedron. A correspondence between these triangulations for certain graphs and maximal cones of a $g$-vector fan of a gentle quiver associated to the graph was discovered by von Bell, Braun, Bruegge, Hanely, Peterson, Serhiyenko, and Yip in 2022. This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph.
  We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases. We show that the fans of its DKK-like triangulations are respectively isomorphic to the normal fan of the cyclohedron and of a new polytope with the same $f$-vector but different combinatorial type than the permutahedron.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Framework for the McKay Correspondence via Gauge-Theoretic Morse Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $\Gamma$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the specializations $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ at roots of unity $\epsilon$ of odd order of the graph algebras, associated to a simply-connected complex semi-simple algebraic group $G$ and a compact oriented surface $\Sigma_{g,n}^{\circ}$ with genus $g$, $n$ punctures, and one boundary component. We prove that the central localizations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ and of its subalgebra $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{u_\epsilon}$ of invariant elements under the coadjoint action of a small quantum group, are central simple algebras of PI degrees that we compute. Also, we describe their centers, and show they are integrally closed rings.</description>

Abstract: We call an $\mathbb{R}$-algebra locally complexified-gentle if it becomes a locally gentle $\mathbb{C}$-algebra up to Morita equivalence after complexification. We use modulated quivers to introduce two types of locally complexified-gentle algebras and show that they are Morita equivalent to some semilinear clannish algebras.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Representation Theorem for Linear GENEOs in Geometric Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of molecular orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>

For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Intersection cohomology without spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</description>
