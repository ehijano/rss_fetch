      <title>Enhancement of Rydberg Blockade via Microwave Dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitations dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.</description>

      <title>Loading of the narrow line Tm MOT from a pulsed cold atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on building a pulsed source of cold Tm atoms and loading of the narrow-line magnito-optical trap (MOT) from the cold atomic beam. We achieve the loading rate of the first-stage MOT in the primary chamber up to $10^8$ atoms/s and obtain a cold atomic beam with the mean longitudinal velocity $\sim10$ m/s and angular spread of 18 mrad in a pulsed mode. We also introduce a novel method to enhance the capture velocity of the narrow-line MOT by incorporating additional axial cooling beam, and achieve loading efficiency $\eta = 10\%$ of the second-stage MOT in the science chamber. Our approach could be extended to other atomic species with similar properties, like Sr, Yb, Dy and Er, serving as a convenient alternative for the traditional 2D-MOT schemes. Providing rapid loading of the MOT in the science chamber, it would reduce preparation time of the atomic ensemble leading to a shorter dead time in spectroscopy experiments and higher repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamic corrections for molecules: Vacuum polarisation and electron self energy in a two-component relativistic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum polarisation (VP) and electron self energy (SE) are implemented and evaluated as quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections in a (quasi-relativistic) two-component zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) framework. For VP, the Uehling potential is considered, and for SE, the effective potentials proposed by Flambaum and Ginges as well as the one proposed by Pyykk\"o and Zhao. QED contributions to ionisation energies of various atoms and group 2 monofluorides, group 1 and 11 valence orbital energies, $^2\mathrm{P}_{1/2} \leftarrow {}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ and $^{2}\mathrm{P}_{3/2} \leftarrow {}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ transition energies of Li-, Na-, and Cu-like ions of nuclear charge $Z$ = 10, 20, ..., 90 as well as $\Pi_{1/2}\leftarrow \Sigma_{1/2}$ and $\Pi_{3/2}\leftarrow\Sigma_{1/2}$ transition energies of BaF and RaF are presented. Furthermore, perturbative and self-consistent treatments of QED corrections are compared for Kohn--Sham orbital energies of gold. It is demonstrated, that QED corrections can be obtained in a two-component ZORA framework efficiently and in excellent agreement with corresponding four-component results.</description>

      <title>Hearing carrier-envelope offset frequency and phase in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely nonlinear interactions between intense light pulses and atoms or molecules can generate new frequencies. Here, we observed high-order harmonics of acoustic waves in laser-induced plasma in air ionized by carrier-envelope offset phase (CEP) stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. The frequency spacing of the acoustic harmonics corresponds to the laser repetition rate, with the harmonic order reaching beyond one hundred. Remarkably, the acoustic harmonic intensity was found to depend on the CEP of the driving light pulses. Furthermore, the carrier-envelope offset frequency of optical frequency combs can be directly measured in the acoustic spectrum, revealing an ultralong coherence preservation from attoseconds to milliseconds in the light-induced plasma. We demonstrate an application of pulse characterization based on these acoustic harmonic waves. Our study underscores the emergence of acoustic frequency combs in kilohertz and megahertz regimes, with potential implications for frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for performing a Bell test using momentum-entangled pairs of atoms with different masses. This proposal uses the metastable isotopes of helium 3He* and 4He* for their single-atom detection capabilities, though the approach could be generalised to other atoms. The entangled state is generated by colliding these species and manipulated via two independent atom interferometers. This method enables precise control of the relative phases of each species, overcoming previous challenges in single-species atomic momentum Bell tests. Numerical simulations of the process show that it should be possible to achieve a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic experimental conditions and within a quantum mechanics framework. This type of superposition is interesting from a general relativity perspective as it introduces ambiguity in determining spacetime curvature of the quantum state. Such experiments are necessary to better understand the intersection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gas Microscopy of Fermions in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopically probing quantum many-body systems by resolving their constituent particles is essential for understanding quantum matter. In most physical systems, distinguishing individual particles, such as electrons in solids, or neutrons and quarks in neutron stars, is impossible. Atom-based quantum simulators offer a unique platform that enables the imaging of each particle in a many-body system. Until now, however, this capability has been limited to quantum systems in discretized space such as optical lattices and tweezers, where spatial degrees of freedom are quantized. Here, we introduce a novel method for imaging atomic quantum many-body systems in the continuum, allowing for in situ resolution of every particle. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas. We probe the density correlation functions, resolving their full spatial functional form, and reveal the shape of the Fermi hole arising from Pauli exclusion as a function of temperature. Our method opens the door to probing strongly-correlated quantum gases in the continuum with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing in situ access to spatially resolved correlation functions of arbitrarily high order across the entire system.</description>

      <title>In situ imaging of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first in situ observation of density fluctuations on the scale of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold gas of bosons. Bunching of $^{87}$Rb atoms in a quasi two-dimensional system is observed by single-atom imaging using a quantum gas microscope. Compared to a classical ensemble, we observe a 30 percent enhancement of the second-order correlation function. We show the spatial and thermal dependence of these correlations. The reported method of detecting in situ correlations can be applied to interacting many-body systems and to the study of critical phenomena near phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>

      <title>Absorption Spectroscopy of $^{40}$Ca Atomic Beams Produced via Pulsed Laser Ablation: A Quantitative Comparison of Ca and CaTiO$_3$ Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsed laser ablation is an increasingly prevalent method for fast ion trap loading of various species, however characteristics of the ablation target source material can affect the ion-loading process. One factor which can reduce the atomic flux from a target is oxidation during atmospheric exposure when preparing or making changes to the ion trap vacuum system. Recent work has shown that perovskite ablation targets produce consistent atomic densities even after exposure to atmosphere when compared to elemental source targets. In this work, we directly compare calcium (Ca) and calcium-titanate (CaTiO$_3$) ablation targets, characterizing the neutral atomic beam flux using resonant, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy of the 423 nm $^{1}S_0 \rightarrow$ $^{1}P_1$ transition in neutral Ca. We measure the ablation plume longitudinal and transverse temperatures, number density, ion production, and spot lifetime for each target. In addition, we compare the ablated atomic beam density for both targets before and after 21 hours of exposure to atmosphere, demonstrating the relative robustness of the CaTiO$_3$ source.</description>

      <title>An architecture for two-qubit encoding in neutral ytterbium-171 atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architecture for encoding two qubits within the optical "clock" transition and nuclear spin-1/2 degree of freedom of neutral ytterbium-171 atoms. Inspired by recent high-fidelity control of all pairs of states within this four-dimensional ququart space, we present a toolbox for intra-ququart (single atom) one- and two-qubit gates, inter-ququart (two atom) Rydberg-based two- and four-qubit gates, and quantum nondemolition (QND) readout. We then use this toolbox to demonstrate the advantages of the ququart encoding for entanglement distillation and quantum error correction which exhibit superior hardware efficiency and better performance in some cases since fewer two-atom (Rydberg-based) operations are required. Finally, leveraging single-state QND readout in our ququart encoding, we present a unique approach to studying interactive circuits as well as to realizing a symmetry protected topological phase of a spin-1 chain with a shallow, constant-depth circuit. These applications are all within reach of recent experiments with neutral ytterbium-171 atom arrays or with several trapped ion species.</description>
