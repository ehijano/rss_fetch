      <title>Statistically Consistent Approximate Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective.This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.</description>

      <title>Robust Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions with Sector-Bounded Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ensuring safe operation of systems subject to input nonlinearities and time-varying safety constraints. We formulate robust time-varying control barrier functions by combining two ingredients: (i) time-varying control barrier functions which capture the time-varying safety constraints, and (ii) pointwise-in-time quadratic constraints that bound the nonlinearity. These ingredients are used to design a safety filter. This filter ensures safety while minimally altering the command from a given baseline controller. The safety filter is implemented as the solution of a second-order cone program, which can be efficiently computed online. The approach is demonstrated on a simple car obstacle avoidance scenario.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Penalty-Based Feedback Law for Reactive Obstacle Avoidance with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of safe autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-filled environments using only local sensory information. We propose a smooth feedback controller derived from an unconstrained penalty-based formulation that guarantees safety by construction. The controller modifies an arbitrary nominal input through a closed-form expression. The resulting closed-form feedback has a projection structure that interpolates between the nominal control and its orthogonal projection onto the obstacle boundary, ensuring forward invariance of a user-defined safety margin. The control law depends only on the distance and bearing to obstacles and requires no map, switching, or set construction. When the nominal input is a gradient descent of a navigation potential, we prove that the closed-loop system achieves almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) to the goal. Undesired equilibria are shown to be unstable under a mild geometric curvature condition, which compares the normal curvature of the obstacle boundary with that of the potential level sets. We refer to the proposed method as SPF (Safe Penalty-based Feedback), which ensures safe and smooth navigation with minimal computational overhead, as demonstrated through simulations in complex 2D and 3D environments.</description>

      <title>Resilient Controller Design with Exponential Reaching Law for Enhanced Load Frequency Stability in Multi-Area Interconnected Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verification and Falsification of ReLU Neural Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrier certificates play an important role in verifying the safety of continuous-time systems, including autonomous driving, robotic manipulators and other critical applications. Recently, ReLU neural barrier certificates -- barrier certificates represented by the ReLU neural networks -- have attracted significant attention in the safe control community due to their promising performance. However, because of the approximate nature of neural networks, rigorous verification methods are required to ensure the correctness of these certificates. This paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the correctness of ReLU neural barrier certificates. The proposed condition can be encoded as either an Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or optimization problem, enabling both verification and falsification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach capable of falsifying ReLU neural barrier certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in both verifying and falsifying such certificates.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Control of Hybrid FES-Exoskeleton: Dynamic Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid assistive systems that integrate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons offer a promising approach for neurorehabilitation. However, control of these systems remains challenging due to actuator redundancy and heterogeneous assistive device constraints. This paper introduces a novel cooperative control architecture based on dynamic allocation to address actuator redundancy in a hybrid FES-exoskeleton system. The proposed approach employs a modular control allocator that redistributes required control torques between FES and exoskeleton actuators in real time, accounting for device-specific limitations and user preferences (e.g., prioritizing one assistive device over another). Within this framework, the high-level controller determines the total assistance level, while the allocator dynamically distributes control effort based on these assistive device-specific considerations. Simulation results and experimental validation demonstrate the method's effectiveness in resolving actuator redundancy in the FES-exoskeleton system while reflecting actuator constraints, indicating its potential for deployment in clinical studies to assess patient acceptance and clinical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Consensus approximation and impulsive control for a class of uncertain multi-agent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of consensus dynamics where the interactions between agents are affected by a time-varying unknown scaling factor. This situation is encountered in the control of robotic fleets over a wireless network or in opinion dynamics where the confidence given to the peers varies in time. Firstly, we establish conditions under which practical upper and lower bounds on the consensus value can be determined. Secondly, we propose control strategies for allocating a given control budget to shift agent states towards a desired consensus value despite the uncertainty. We provide computationally efficient linear programming-based approaches for both problems and validate the obtained results in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Modelling and Identification of Banking Effects in Confined Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vessels navigating in confined waters are subject to banking effects, which are hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from pressure differentials between the vessel sides, significantly affecting manoeuvrability and safety. Existing numerical approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately capture these effects but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time control or estimation. This paper presents a closed-form, first-principles model of banking effects. The model coefficients are identified using physics-informed regression on towing tank experiment data for a scaled container vessel. Validation through Shapley value analysis confirms the significance of the banking terms in reproducing the measured forces and moments. Lastly, the derived coefficients are shown to be non-dimensional, making the model applicable across different scales that preserve vessel geometry.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Mechanical Models for Sloshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propellant sloshing is a well-known, but not completely mastered phenomenon in space vehicles. It is particularly critical in both microgravity environments - such as interplanetary spacecraft requiring high pointing stability - and high-g conditions, as encountered during launch, re-entry, and landing. In both cases, sloshing can significantly affect vehicle performance and stability, and must often be explicitly considered in the design of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem.
  For stability analysis and control design, the most common approach to modeling sloshing is through an equivalent mechanical representation, where the moving propellant is treated as a mechanical system interacting with the rigid (or flexible) spacecraft. Pendulum-based models and mass-spring-damper systems are widely used by control analysts to assess sloshing-induced perturbations on vehicles subjected to persistent non-gravitational acceleration along one of their body axes.
  In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical formulation of pendulum dynamics, starting from a single spherical pendulum attached to a rigid spacecraft. We derive the nonlinear equations of motion for this 8-degree-of-freedom multi-body system, and then extend the formulation to include multiple pendulums, representing multiple sloshing modes within a tank and/or multiple tanks on the same vehicle. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding linearized equations of motion, explicitly accounting for a nominal longitudinal force acting on the vehicle - consistent with the high-g sloshing regime - expressed in either the inertial or body frame. Finally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between the pendulum and mass-spring-damper models and validate the proposed models through time-domain simulation and frequency-domain analysis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Intelligence for Tactical Decision-Making: Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Weapon Target Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern aerospace defense systems increasingly rely on autonomous decision-making to coordinate large numbers of interceptors against multiple incoming threats. Conventional weapon-target assignment (WTA) algorithms, including mixed-integer programming and auction-based methods, show limitations in dynamic and uncertain tactical environments where human-like reasoning and adaptive prioritization are required. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM) driven WTA framework that integrates generalized intelligence into cooperative missile guidance. The proposed system formulates the tactical decision process as a reasoning problem, in which an LLM evaluates spatial and temporal relationships among interceptors, targets, and defended assets to generate real-time assignments. In contrast to classical optimization methods, the approach leverages contextual mission data such as threat direction, asset priority, and closing velocity to adapt dynamically and reduce assignment switching. A dedicated simulation environment supports both static and dynamic assignment modes. Results demonstrate improved consistency, adaptability, and mission-level prioritization, establishing a foundation for integrating generalized artificial intelligence into tactical guidance systems.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection in Solar Thermal Systems using Probabilistic Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Security-Constrained AC/DC Grid Optimal Power Flow Considering Asymmetrical HVDC Grid Operation using Sparse Tableau Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.</description>

      <title>Large-Signal Stability Guarantees for a Scalable DC Microgrid with Nonlinear Distributed Control: The Slow Communication Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.</description>

Hence, in this study, we explore the stability guarantees of a promising control proposal for cyber-physical DC microgrids (MGs), specifically designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the inner(decentralized) and outer(distributed) nested loops, and thus, ensuring that the system reaches the desired (optimal) steady state under appropriate tuning verifying some stability conditions. To prove the effectiveness of our method, our findings are supported by testing the control method in a time-domain simulation case study involving a low-voltage DC microgrid, as well as a small-signal stability analysis</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Approach to Solving Numerical Constraint Satisfaction Problems on Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying feasibility in decision-making, critical in many industries, can be framed as a constraint satisfaction problem. This paper focuses on characterising a subset of parameter values from an a priori set that satisfy constraints on a directed acyclic graph of constituent functions. The main assumption is that these functions and constraints may be evaluated for given parameter values, but they need not be known in closed form and could result from expensive or proprietary simulations. This setting lends itself to using sampling methods to gain an inner approximation of the feasible domain. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the paper contributes new methodology to leverage the graph structure for decomposing the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems defined on the respective nodes. The working hypothesis that the Cartesian product of the solution sets yielded by the subproblems will tighten the a priori parameter domain, before solving the full problem defined on the graph, is demonstrated through four case studies relevant to machine learning and engineering. Future research will extend this approach to cyclic graphs and account for parametric uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions for Safe Stabilization with Bounded Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present verifiable conditions for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety under bounded controls. These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs.</description>

      <title>Safe Planning in Interactive Environments via Iterative Policy Updates and Adversarially Robust Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Principle: Empirical Evidence for Emergent Phase Synchronization in Human Causal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.</description>

      <title>Filtering Jump Markov Systems with Partially Known Dynamics: A Model-Based Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge</description>

      <title>A Shared-Autonomy Construction Robotic System for Overhead Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ongoing development of a robotic system for overhead work such as ceiling drilling. The hardware platform comprises a mobile base with a two-stage lift, on which a bimanual torso is mounted with a custom-designed drilling end effector and RGB-D cameras. To support teleoperation in dynamic environments with limited visibility, we use Gaussian splatting for online 3D reconstruction and introduce motion parameters to model moving objects. For safe operation around dynamic obstacles, we developed a neural configuration-space barrier approach for planning and control. Initial feasibility studies demonstrate the capability of the hardware in drilling, bolting, and anchoring, and the software in safe teleoperation in a dynamic environment.</description>

      <title>Modelos Empiricos de Pos-Dupla Selecao por LASSO: Discussoes para Estudos do Transporte Aereo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses forms of estimation by regularized regression and model selection using the LASSO method - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is recognized as one of the main supervised learning methods applied to high-dimensional econometrics, allowing work with large volumes of data and multiple correlated controls. Conceptual issues related to the consequences of high dimensionality in modern econometrics and the principle of sparsity, which underpins regularization procedures, are addressed. The study examines the main post-double selection and post-regularization models, including variations applied to instrumental variable models. A brief description of the lassopack routine package, its syntaxes, and examples of HD, HDS (High-Dimension Sparse), and IV-HDS models, with combinations involving fixed effects estimators, is also presented. Finally, the potential application of the approach in research focused on air transport is discussed, with emphasis on an empirical study on the operational efficiency of airlines and aircraft fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>A Robust Task-Level Control Architecture for Learned Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Overparameterized Problems: Inherent Properties of the Compositional Structure of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.</description>

      <title>The Age-Structured Chemostat with Substrate Dynamics as a Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.</description>

      <title>VLF-MSC: Vision-Language Feature-Based Multimodal Semantic Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Equations for Deep Linear Neural Networks: A Survey from a Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.</description>

      <title>Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the flight path for a scouting Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle</title>

Abstract: Post-disaster situations pose unique navigation challenges. One of those challenges is the unstructured nature of the environment, which makes it hard to layout paths for rescue vehicles. We propose the use of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in such scenario to perform reconnaissance across the environment. To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Incremental DRL-Based Resource Management for Dynamic Network Slicing in an Urban-Wide Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing provides localized resources within mobile networks to address the requirements of emerging latency-sensitive and computing-intensive applications. At the edge, dynamic requests necessitate sophisticated resource management for adaptive network slicing. This involves optimizing resource allocations, scaling functions, and load balancing to utilize only essential resources under constrained network scenarios. However, existing solutions largely assume static slice counts, ignoring the re-optimization overhead associated with management algorithms when slices fluctuate. Moreover, many approaches rely on simplified energy models that overlook intertemporal resource scheduling and are predominantly evaluated through simulations, neglecting critical practical considerations. This paper presents an incremental cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for resource management in dynamic edge slicing. The proposed approach optimizes long-term slicing benefits by reducing delay and energy consumption while minimizing retraining overhead in response to slice variations. Furthermore, we implement an urban-wide edge computing testbed based on OpenStack and Kubernetes to validate the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental MADDPG method outperforms benchmark strategies in aggregated slicing utility and reduces training energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the re-optimization approach.</description>

Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies observability for non-uniform hypergraphs with inputs and outputs. To capture higher-order interactions, we define a canonical non-homogeneous dynamical system with nonlinear outputs on hypergraphs. We then construct algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions based on polynomial ideals and varieties for global observability at an initial state of hypergraphs. An example is given to illustrate the proposed criteria for observability. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for local observability are derived based on rank conditions of observability matrices, which provide a framework to study local observability for non-uniform hypergraphs. Finally, the similarity of observability for hypergraphs is proposed using similarity of tensors, which reveals the relation of observability between two hypergraphs and helps to check the observability intuitively.</description>

      <title>Mixed Platoon Control under Noise and Attacks: Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control and Human-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling mixed platoons, which consist of both connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), poses significant challenges due to the uncertain and unknown human driving behaviors. Data-driven control methods offer promising solutions by leveraging available trajectory data, but their performance can be compromised by noise and attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) framework based on data-driven reachability analysis. The framework over-approximates system dynamics under noise and attack using a matrix zonotope set derived from data, and develops a stabilizing feedback control law. By decoupling the mixed platoon system into nominal and error components, we employ data-driven reachability sets to recursively compute error reachable sets that account for noise and attacks, and obtain tightened safety constraints of the nominal system. This leads to a robust data-driven predictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner. Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the RDeeP-LCC method significantly improves robustness against noise and attacks, while enhancing tracking accuracy, control efficiency, energy economy, driving comfort, and driving safety.</description>

      <title>Optimized Design of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation for Discretizing Analog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to digital system design involves transforming a continuous-time (s-domain) transfer function into the discrete-time (z-domain) using methods such as Euler or Tustin. These transformations are shown to be specific cases of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT), characterized by a design parameter, $\alpha$, whose physical interpretation and optimal selection remain inadequately explored. In this paper, we propose an alternative derivation of the GBT derived by employing a new hexagonal shape to approximate the enclosed area of the error function, and we define the parameter $\alpha$ as a shape factor. We reveal, for the first time, the physical meaning of $\alpha$ as the backward rectangular ratio of the proposed hexagonal shape. Through domain mapping, the stable range of is rigorously established to be [0.5, 1]. Depending on the operating frequency and the chosen $\alpha$, we observe two distinct distortion modes, i.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We further develop an optimal design method for $\alpha$ by minimizing a normalized magnitude or phase error objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the design and testing of a low-pass filter (LPF), demonstrating strong agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users; thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>

      <title>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</description>

      <title>CarboNet: A Finite-Time Combustion-Tolerant Compartmental Network for Tropospheric Carbon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While governments and international organizations have set the net-zero target to prevent a climate event horizon, practical solutions are lacking mainly because of the impracticability in completely replacing combustion processes. To address the net-zero target problem, in this paper we first design a compartmental network whose states must remain in the nonnegative orthant for physical consistency and in which the carbon dioxide emissions result from the combustion of diesel in vehicles and gas in house heaters. Then, we design both full-state and output-feedback linear-quadratic regulators of the compartmental network to bring the mass of carbon dioxide to the pre-industrial era, which is reached in approximately 25 and 60 days, respectively. The output-feedback controller tolerates for 6 days the combustion taking place in 5,000 vehicles and in 10,000 house heating systems, meets the net-zero target, and nullifies the extraction of finite natural resources. With closed-loop control, the tropospheric temperature stabilizes approximately to the pre-industrial era reference condition, i.e., to 13.5 {\deg}C, which is 21.7 {\deg}C lower than the steady-state temperature achieved without carbon capture. This work is a first step in designing optimal network control systems for climate stability. Source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Differential Dynamic Programming for the Optimal Control Problem with an Ellipsoidal Target Set and Its Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses an extended class of optimal control problems where a target for a system state has the form of an ellipsoid rather than a fixed, single point. As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.</description>

Abstract: The synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a design-first-analyze-later approach, which often obscures fundamental performance limitations and hinders the systematic design of algorithms operating at the achievable theoretical boundaries. Recently, a framework based on frequency-domain techniques from robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating the design and analysis stages, this framework enables the identification of fundamental performance limits. In this paper, we build on this framework and extend it to address algorithms for solving strongly convex problems with equality constraints. As a result, we obtain a new class of algorithms that offers sharp trade-off between number of matrix multiplication per iteration and convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Predict-then-Optimize for Seaport Power-Logistics Scheduling: Generalization across Varying Tasks Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance the decision quality of forecasts, decision-focused learning has been proposed, which aligns the training of forecasting models with downstream decision outcomes. However, this end-to-end design inherently restricts the value of forecasting models to only a specific task structure, and thus generalize poorly to evolving tasks induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model across a varying tasks stream with a sustainable long-term computational burden. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.</description>
