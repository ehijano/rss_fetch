      <title>Pareto's Limits: Improving Inequality Estimates in America, 1917 to 1965</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: American income inequality, generally estimated with tax data, in the 20th century is widely recognized to have followed a U-curve, though debates persist over the extent of this curve, specifically regarding how high the peaks are and how deep the trough is. These debates focus on assumptions about defining income and handling deductions. However, the choice of interpolation methods for using tax authorities' tabular data to estimate the income of the richest centiles -- especially when no micro-files are available -- has not been discussed. This is crucial because tabular data were consistently used from 1917 to 1965. In this paper, we show that there is an alternative to the standard method of Pareto Interpolation (PI). We demonstrate that this alternative -- Maximum Entropy (ME) -- provides more accurate results and leads to significant revisions in the shape of the U-curve of income inequality.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy in Werewolf Game: A Game Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Werewolf game, also known as Mafia game, is a social deduction game that models the conflict between an informed minority (werewolf group) and an uninformed majority (citizen group). This paper explores the optimal strategies of the werewolf game from the perspective of game theory, focusing on cases both with and without prophet. First we examine the existing strategy in game without prophet and propose ``random strategy +", which provides an improved winning probability for the werewolve group. Then we further study the game with prophet, and find the game with prophet can be transformed into a extensive game with complete but imperfect information under a specific rule. We construct a model and design an algorithm to achieve PBE and maximize the citizen group's winning probability. In the end, we examine a property of PBE in game without any restriction.</description>

      <title>Investor behavior and multiscale cross-correlations: Unveiling regime shifts in global financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to capture emergent patterns in the cross-correlations of financial markets, highlighting regime changes on a global scale. In our approach, financial markets are viewed as complex adaptive systems, and multiscale properties and cross-correlations are considered, particularly during stress conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022, and Brexit. We investigate whether significant disruptions reflect an imbalance in investment horizons among investors, and we propose a measure based on this imbalance to depict the impact on global financial markets. The detrended cross-correlation cost (DCCC), which is derived from detrended cross-correlation analysis, uses cross-correlations at different timescales to capture variations in investment horizons amid financial uncertainties. Our algorithm, which combines DCCC analysis and the minimum-spanning-tree filtering approach, tracks system interconnectedness and investor imbalances. We tested the DCCC indicator using daily price series of G7, Russian, and Chinese markets over the past decade and found that it increases sharply during ``crash'' periods compared to ``business as usual'' periods. Our empirical results confirm that short-term investment horizons dominate during financial instabilities; this validates our hypothesis and indicates that the DCCC can serve as a leading indicator of shifts in financial-market regimes.</description>
