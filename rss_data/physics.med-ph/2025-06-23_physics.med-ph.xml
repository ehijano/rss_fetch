      <title>Unsupervised deep learning model for fast energy layer pre-selection of delivery-efficient proton arc therapy plan optimization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage, minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index by 0.16 (p &lt; 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p &lt; 0.01), shortens the energy switching time by 38.4% (p &lt; 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to brainstem by 0.21 (p &lt; 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.</description>

      <title>Seven-Probe Fiber Detector for Time-Resolved Source Tracking in HDR-Brachytherapy: Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\bf Purpose:} This study evaluates a compact biocompatible Seven-probe Scintillator Detector (7SD) for monitoring HDR-BT treatment sequences across a range of dwell times and source-probe spacings representative of most HDR-BT techniques.
  {\bf Methods:} The SSD comprises seven detection cells made of Gd$_2$O$_2$S:Tb, each measuring 0.28 $\pm$ 0.02 mm in diameter and 0.43 $\pm$ 0.02 mm in length, coupled to the microstructured tips of silica optical fibers (110-micron diameter). The probes, spaced 15 mm apart along the fiber axis, are organized into a bundle with a total diameter of less than 0.45 mm. The SSD was tested using a MicroSelectron 9.1 Ci Ir-192 HDR afterloader connected to a BT stainless steel interstitial needle. Detection signals were acquired with an sCMOS camera equipped. Monitoring of dwell times and positions was performed by combining detection signals from all seven probes.
  {\bf Results:} A total of 4,040 dwell positions were analyzed, covering source-probe spacings from 10 to 36 mm and a source travel range of 62 mm, with dwell times ranging from 0.1 to 19.5 s. The 7SD successfully identified 99.5\% of the dwell positions. In cylindrical coordinates, the measured dwell positions deviated from the planned values by 0.224 $\pm$ 0.155 mm (radial) and 0.077 $\pm$ 0.181 mm (axial, source travel axis). The average deviation from planned dwell times was 0.006 $\pm$ 0.061 s. 99.4\% of the dwell positions were measured within the 1 mm reliability threshold. The remaining 0.6\% of deviations consistently occurred at the initial dwell position of treatment sequences and appear to stem from a systematic source positioning error by the afterloader. Additionally, the detector accurately identified intentional needle mispositioning scenarios with sub-millimeter accuracy.</description>

      <title>Theoretical novel medical isotope production with deuterium-tritium fusion technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The emergence and growth of fusion technology enables investigative studies into its applications beyond typical power production facilities. This study seeks to determine the viability of medical isotope production with the neutrons produced in an example large fusion device. Using FISPACT-II (a nuclear inventory code) and a simulated fusion spectrum, the production yields of a significant number of potentially clinically relevant (both in use and novel) medical isotopes were calculated. Comparative calculations were also conducted against existing production routes.
  Results: Depending on the neutron flux of the fusion device, it could be an ideal technology to produce alpha-emitters such as 212Bi/212Pb, it may be able to contribute to the production of 99mTc/99Mo, and could offer an alternative route in the production a few Auger-emitting candidates. There is also a long list of beta-emitting nuclides where fusion technology may be best placed to produce over existing technologies including 67Cu, 90Y and 47Sc.
  Conclusions: It is theoretically viable to produce existing and novel medical isotopes with fusion technology. However, a significant number of assumptions form the basis of this study which would need to be studied further for any particular nuclide of interest.</description>

      <title>Radiochromic Film Dosimetry for VHEE and UHDR: Considerations for the CLEAR Facility and Comparisons with Alanine, RPL and Dosimetry Phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiochromic films (RCFs) offer valuable two-dimensional dosimetry capabilities with a conceptually simple operating principle that requires minimal investment, making them particularly suitable for very high energy electron (VHEE) FLASH dosimetry where dosimetry standards are currently lacking. However, achieving high-accuracy measurements with RCFs presents significant practical challenges. Without the standardised protocols that ensure reliable outcomes across applications and facilities, knowledge of RCF behaviour becomes essential. This paper identifies common sources of error in RCF preparation, scanning, and processing while proposing specific mitigation strategies to improve accuracy and efficiency. Using our optimised RCF protocol at the CLEAR facility, we demonstrate relative agreement within 5% compared to alanine dosimeters when measuring Gaussian VHEE beams, establishing a foundation for reliable dosimetry in these advanced radiotherapy applications.</description>

      <title>Implicit neural representations for accurate estimation of the standard model of white matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature, extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then, accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs), which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials, supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise, supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.</description>

      <title>Collimator-less SPECT System Design for Dynamic Whole-body Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a Compton SPECT system for whole-body imaging of Actinium-225 (225Ac), one of the trending radionuclides for targeted alpha therapy (TAT). The Compton SPECT system enables multi-energy gamma photon detection with higher efficiency compared to mechanically collimated SPECT. The system consists of two detectors, providing a field of view (FOV) adequate for whole-body imaging, while achieving high sensitivity and clinically usable imaging resolution within a reasonable scanning time. This work focuses on the system design and evaluation using the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Gate. The imaging performance is evaluated at two energy peaks (218 keV, 440 keV), representing the major detectable gamma energies generated from 225Ac. We explore the possibility of using the Compton SPECT system for treatment response monitoring in TAT. Results demonstrate an image resolution of 1.0 cm using a NEMA IQ phantom with 5.7 MBq of 225Ac simulated in a cold background. An image resolution of 1.3 cm can be achieved with a hot to background ratio of 30:1, and a resolution of 3.7 cm can be achieved with an activity ratio of 12:1. The best achievable sensitivity at 10 cm distance to the detector is 0.5% with the two energy windows (211-225 keV, 430-450 keV) selected. The proposed system may serve as an alternative imaging tool for TAT scanning in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Design of a Wearable Parallel Electrical Impedance Imaging System for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wireless wearable Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system has been developed utilizing the AD5933 chip to achieve real-time imaging of lung respiration. The system employs a voltage excitation method tailored to human impedance characteristics, injecting current by applying a known voltage and measuring the resulting current through the body. Additionally, specific measures have been implemented to effectively suppress signal oscillations and leakage currents caused by parasitic capacitances. To enhance data acquisition speed, the system employs five parallel AD5933 units, with multiple techniques implemented to ensure high synchronization during simultaneous measurements. Performance testing shows that the system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 50 dB, a relative standard deviation below 0.3%, and a reciprocity error under 0.8%. Imaging experiments using a water tank phantom, human lungs during breathing, and a resting human calf further demonstrate that this portable EIT system can accurately measure biological tissues with high precision and low cost.</description>
