      <title>Sequent Calculi for Data-Aware Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document serves as a companion to the paper of the same title, wherein we introduce a Gentzen-style sequent calculus for HXPathD. It provides full technical details and proofs from the main paper. As such, it is intended as a reference for readers seeking a deeper understanding of the formal results, including soundness, completeness, invertibility, and cut elimination for the calculus.</description>

      <title>From a Constraint Logic Programming Language to a Formal Verification Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {log} (read 'setlog') was born as a Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) language where sets and binary relations are first-class citizens, thus fostering set programming. Internally, {log} is a constraint satisfiability solver implementing decision procedures for several fragments of set theory. Hence, {log} can be used as a declarative, set, logic programming language and as an automated theorem prover for set theory. Over time {log} has been extended with some components integrated to the satisfiability solver thus providing a formal verification environment. In this paper we make a comprehensive presentation of this environment which includes a language for the description of state machines based on set theory, an interactive environment for the execution of functional scenarios over state machines, a generator of verification conditions for state machines, automated verification of state machines, and test case generation. State machines are both, programs and specifications; exactly the same code works as a program and as its specification. In this way, with a few additions, a CLP language turned into a seamlessly integrated programming and automated proof system.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems (with Survey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v8 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates ultrafilters in the context of connectivity systems, defined as pairs $(X, f)$ where $X$ is a finite set and $f$ is a symmetric submodular function. Ultrafilters, essential in topology and set theory, are extended to these systems, with a focus on their relationship to graph width parameters, which help analyze graph complexity. We demonstrate theorems for ultrafilters on connectivity systems and explore related concepts such as prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases. New parameters for width, length, and depth are introduced, providing further insight into graph width. The study also includes a comparison of various graph width parameters and their related concepts, offering a foundation for future research in graph theory and computational complexity. Additionally, we explore connections to other mathematical disciplines, including set theory, lattice theory, and matroid theory, expanding the scope of ultrafilters and graph width. (It also includes information similar to that found in surveys, aiming to promote future research on graph width parameters.)</description>

      <title>Solving MDPs with LTLf+ and PPLTL+ Temporal Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal logics LTLf+ and PPLTL+ have recently been proposed to express objectives over infinite traces. These logics are appealing because they match the expressive power of LTL on infinite traces while enabling efficient DFA-based techniques, which have been crucial to the scalability of reactive synthesis and adversarial planning in LTLf and PPLTL over finite traces. In this paper, we demonstrate that these logics are also highly effective in the context of MDPs. Introducing a technique tailored for probabilistic systems, we leverage the benefits of efficient DFA-based methods and compositionality. This approach is simpler than its non-probabilistic counterparts in reactive synthesis and adversarial planning, as it accommodates a controlled form of nondeterminism (``good for MDPs") in the automata when transitioning from finite to infinite traces. Notably, by exploiting compositionality, our solution is both implementation-friendly and well-suited for straightforward symbolic implementations.</description>

      <title>Alpay Algebra II: Identity as Fixed-Point Emergence in Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second installment of the Alpay Algebra framework, I formally define identity as a fixed point that emerges through categorical recursion. Building upon the transfinite operator $\varphi^\infty$, I characterize identity as the universal solution to a self-referential functorial equation over a small cartesian closed category. I prove the existence and uniqueness of such identity-fixed-points via ordinal-indexed iteration, and interpret their convergence through internal categorical limits. Functors, adjunctions, and morphisms are reconstructed as dynamic traces of evolving states governed by $\varphi$, reframing identity not as a static label but as a stabilized process. Through formal theorems and symbolic flows, I show how these fixed points encode symbolic memory, recursive coherence, and semantic invariance. This paper positions identity as a mathematical structure that arises from within the logic of change itself computable, convergent, and categorically intrinsic.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Model Checking for Relational Reachability (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov decision processes model systems subject to nondeterministic and probabilistic uncertainty. A plethora of verification techniques addresses variations of reachability properties, such as: Is there a scheduler resolving the nondeterminism such that the probability to reach an error state is above a threshold? We consider an understudied extension that relates different reachability probabilities, such as: Is there a scheduler such that two sets of states are reached with different probabilities? These questions appear naturally in the design of randomized algorithms and in various security applications. We provide a tractable algorithm for many variations of this problem, while proving computational hardness of some others. An implementation of our algorithm beats solvers for more general probabilistic hyperlogics by orders of magnitude, on the subset of their benchmarks that are within our fragment.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs between classical and quantum space using spooky pebbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.</description>

      <title>The internal languages of univalent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, $\sum$-types, and $\prod$-types. This theorem expresses that the internal language of locally Cartesian closed categories is extensional Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums and products. In this paper, we study the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend it to various classes of toposes, among which are $\prod$-pretoposes and elementary toposes. The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Rocq and the UniMath library.</description>

      <title>How to fit large complexity classes into TFNP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subclasses of TFNP (total functional NP) are usually defined by specifying a complete problem, which is necessarily in TFNP, and including all problems many-one reducible to it. We study two notions of how a TFNP problem can be reducible to an object, such as a complexity class, outside TFNP. This gives rise to subclasses of TFNP which capture some properties of that outside object. We show that well-known subclasses can arise in this way, for example PPA from reducibility to parity P and PLS from reducibility to P^NP.
  We study subclasses arising from PSPACE and the polynomial hierarchy, and show that they are characterized by the propositional proof systems Frege and constant-depth Frege, extending the known pairings between natural TFNP subclasses and proof systems.
  We study approximate counting from this point of view, and look for a subclass of TFNP that gives a natural home to combinatorial principles such as Ramsey which can be proved using approximate counting. We relate this to the recently-studied Long choice and Short choice problems.</description>
