      <title>Computational predictions of hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model is presented to predict hydrogen-assisted fatigue. The model combines a phase field description of fracture and fatigue, stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion, and a toughness degradation formulation with cyclic and hydrogen contributions. Hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with experiments over all the scenarios considered, spanning multiple load ratios, H2 pressures and loading frequencies. These are obtained without any calibration with hydrogen-assisted fatigue data, taking as input only mechanical and hydrogen transport material properties, the material's fatigue characteristics (from a single test in air), and the sensitivity of fracture toughness to hydrogen content. Furthermore, the model is used to determine: (i) what are suitable test loading frequencies to obtain conservative data, and (ii) the underestimation made when not pre-charging samples. The model can handle both laboratory specimens and large-scale engineering components, enabling the Virtual Testing paradigm in infrastructure exposed to hydrogen environments and cyclic loading.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired Nested-Isotropic Lattices with Tunable Anisotropy for Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents innovative nested-isotropic lattices for additive manufacturing, drawing inspiration from bio-architectures found in cortical bone osteons, golden spirals, and fractals. These lattices provide tunable anisotropy by integrating architectural elements like ``nesting orders (NOs)'' and corresponding ``nesting orientations (NORs),'' along with repetitive self-similar X-cross struts and three four-fold axes of symmetry, resulting in a wide spectrum of lattice designs. Nine mono-nest and twenty multi-nest lattices, along with 252 parametric variations, are realized. The relative density \( \bar{\rho} \) and surface area density \( \bar{S} \) are calculated. Employing finite element-based numerical homogenization, elastic stiffness tensors are estimated to evaluate the anisotropic measure - Zener ratio \( Z \) and elastic modulus \( \bar{E} \) for all lattice designs. The mono-nest lattices generated considering higher NOs and respective NORs exhibit a transition from shear dominant to tensile/compression dominant (TCD) anisotropic behavior and their strut size variations show a strong influence on \( \bar{\rho} \), \( \bar{S} \), and \( \bar{E} \). In contrast, multi-nest lattices exhibit isotropic and neo-isotropic characteristics, with strut size mismatch exerting more influence on \( Z \). Increasing NOs and NORs result in isotropic or TCD behavior for most multi-nest lattices, with strut size mismatch leading to many isotropic lattices. These bio-inspired nested lattices, coupled with advancements in additive manufacturing, hold potential for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Chemical Process Modeling: Meta-Learning with Physics-Informed Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel application of foundation models in the domain of nonlinear chemical process modeling. Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

      <title>Dynamic classifier auditing by unsupervised anomaly detection methods: an application in packaging industry predictive maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance in manufacturing industry applications is a challenging research field. Packaging machines are widely used in a large number of logistic companies' warehouses and must be working uninterruptedly. Traditionally, preventive maintenance strategies have been carried out to improve the performance of these machines. However, this kind of policies does not take into account the information provided by the sensors implemented in the machines. This paper presents an expert system for the automatic estimation of work orders to implement predictive maintenance policies for packaging machines. The key idea is that, from a set of alarms related to sensors implemented in the machine, the expert system should take a maintenance action while optimizing the response time. The work order estimator will act as a classifier, yielding a binary decision of whether a machine must undergo a maintenance action by a technician or not, followed by an unsupervised anomaly detection-based filtering stage to audit the classifier's output. The methods used for anomaly detection were: One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) and a majority (hard) voting ensemble of them. All anomaly detection methods improve the performance of the baseline classifer but the best performance in terms of F1 score was obtained by the majority voting ensemble.</description>

      <title>What are You Weighting For? Improved Weights for Gaussian Mixture Filtering With Application to Cislunar Orbit Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the critical aspect of accurate weight computation during the measurement incorporation phase of Gaussian mixture filters. The proposed novel approach computes weights by linearizing the measurement model about each component's posterior estimate rather than the the prior, as traditionally done. This work proves equivalence with traditional methods for linear models, provides novel sigma-point extensions to the traditional and proposed methods, and empirically demonstrates improved performance in nonlinear cases. Two illustrative examples, the Avocado and a cislunar single target tracking scenario, serve to highlight the advantages of the new weight computation technique by analyzing filter accuracy and consistency through varying the number of Gaussian mixture components.</description>

      <title>PDE Control Gym: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Boundary Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>

      <title>How to integrate cloud service, data analytic and machine learning technique to reduce cyber risks associated with the modern cloud based infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of cloud technology, machine learning, and data visualization techniques allows hybrid enterprise networks to hold massive volumes of data and provide employees and customers easy access to these cloud data. These massive collections of complex data sets are facing security challenges. While cloud platforms are more vulnerable to security threats and traditional security technologies are unable to cope with the rapid data explosion in cloud platforms, machine learning powered security solutions and data visualization techniques are playing instrumental roles in detecting security threat, data breaches, and automatic finding software vulnerabilities. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the widely used cloud services, machine learning techniques and data visualization approach and demonstrate how to integrate cloud service, data analytic and machine learning techniques that can be used to detect and reduce cyber risks associated with the modern cloud based infrastructure. In this paper I applied the machine learning supervised classifier to design a model based on well-known UNSW-NB15 dataset to predict the network behavior metrics and demonstrated how data analytics techniques can be integrated to visualize network traffics.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Contrastive Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning on graphs has achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning for Stackelberg Equilibrium Computation in Newsvendor Pricing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the application of online learning in a Stackelberg game pertaining to a system with two learning agents in a dyadic exchange network, consisting of a supplier and retailer, specifically where the parameters of the demand function are unknown. In this game, the supplier is the first-moving leader, and must determine the optimal wholesale price of the product. Subsequently, the retailer who is the follower, must determine both the optimal procurement amount and selling price of the product. In the perfect information setting, this is known as the classical price-setting Newsvendor problem, and we prove the existence of a unique Stackelberg equilibrium when extending this to a two-player pricing game. In the framework of online learning, the parameters of the reward function for both the follower and leader must be learned, under the assumption that the follower will best respond with optimism under uncertainty. A novel algorithm based on contextual linear bandits with a measurable uncertainty set is used to provide a confidence bound on the parameters of the stochastic demand. Consequently, optimal finite time regret bounds on the Stackelberg regret, along with convergence guarantees to an approximate Stackelberg equilibrium, are provided.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training on Large-Scale Generated Docking Conformations with HelixDock to Unlock the Potential of Protein-ligand Structure Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand structure prediction is an essential task in drug discovery, predicting the binding interactions between small molecules (ligands) and target proteins (receptors). Recent advances have incorporated deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of protein-ligand structure prediction. Nevertheless, the experimental validation of docking conformations remains costly, it raises concerns regarding the generalizability of these deep learning-based methods due to the limited training data. In this work, we show that by pre-training on a large-scale docking conformation generated by traditional physics-based docking tools and then fine-tuning with a limited set of experimentally validated receptor-ligand complexes, we can obtain a protein-ligand structure prediction model with outstanding performance. Specifically, this process involved the generation of 100 million docking conformations for protein-ligand pairings, an endeavor consuming roughly 1 million CPU core days. The proposed model, HelixDock, aims to acquire the physical knowledge encapsulated by the physics-based docking tools during the pre-training phase. HelixDock has been rigorously benchmarked against both physics-based and deep learning-based baselines, demonstrating its exceptional precision and robust transferability in predicting binding confirmation. In addition, our investigation reveals the scaling laws governing pre-trained protein-ligand structure prediction models, indicating a consistent enhancement in performance with increases in model parameters and the volume of pre-training data. Moreover, we applied HelixDock to several drug discovery-related tasks to validate its practical utility. HelixDock demonstrates outstanding capabilities on both cross-docking and structure-based virtual screening benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Digital Twin Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>
