      <title>Transfer learning empowers material Z classification with muon tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon sources exhibit distinct scattering angle distributions when interacting with materials of different atomic numbers (Z values), facilitating the identification of various Z-class materials, particularly those radioactive high-Z nuclear elements. Most of the traditional identification methods are based on complex muon event reconstruction and trajectory fitting processes. Supervised machine learning methods offer some improvement but rely heavily on prior knowledge of target materials, significantly limiting their practical applicability in detecting concealed materials. For the first time, transfer learning is introduced into the field of muon tomography in this work. We propose two lightweight neural network models for fine-tuning and adversarial transfer learning, utilizing muon tomography data of bare materials to predict the Z-class of coated materials. By employing the inverse cumulative distribution function method, more accurate scattering angle distributions could be obtained from limited data, leading to an improvement by nearly 4\% in prediction accuracy compared with the traditional random sampling based training. When applied to coated materials with limited labeled or even unlabeled muon tomography data, the proposed method achieves an overall prediction accuracy exceeding 96\%, with high-Z materials reaching nearly 99\%. Simulation results indicate that transfer learning improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10\% compared to direct prediction without transfer. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in overcoming the physical challenges associated with limited labeled/unlabeled data, highlights the promising potential of transfer learning in the field of muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Experimental Studies on Spatial Resolution of a Delay-Line Current-Biased Kinetic-Inductance Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A current-biased kinetic inductance detector (CB-KID) is a novel superconducting detector to construct a neutron transmission imaging system. The characteristics of a superconducting neutron detector have been systematically studied to improve spatial resolution of our CB-KID neutron detector. In this study, we investigated the distribution of spatial resolutions under different operating conditions and examined the homogeneity of spatial resolutions in the detector in detail. We used a commercial standard Gd Siemens-star pattern as a conventional method to estimate the spatial resolution, and a lab-made 10B-dot array intended to examine detailed profiles on a distribution of spatial resolutions. We found that discrepancy in propagation velocities in the detector affected the uniformity of the spatial resolutions in neutron imaging. We analyzed the ellipsoidal line profiles along the circumferences of several different test circles in the Siemens-star image to find a distribution of spatial resolutions. Note that we succeeded in controlling the detector temperature precisely enough to realize stable propagation velocities of the signals in the detector to achieve the best spatial resolution with a delay-line CB-KID technique.</description>

      <title>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</description>

      <title>New Frontiers in Muon-Spin Spectroscopy Using Si-Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of novel quantum materials relies on muon-spin rotation, relaxation, or resonance (\mSR) measurements. Yet, a fundamental limitation persists: many of these materials can only be synthesized in extremely small quantities, often at sub-millimeter scales. While \mSR ~offers unique insights into electronic and magnetic properties, existing spectrometers lack a sub-millimeter spatial resolution and the possibility of triggerless pump-probe data acquisition, which would enable more advanced measurements. The General Purpose Surface-muon instrument (GPS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is currently limited to a muon stopping rate of \SI{40}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{120}{\kilo\hertz}, a constraint that will become more pressing with the upcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HIMB) project. To overcome these challenges, we demonstrate the feasibility of employing ultra-thin monolithic Si-pixel detectors to reconstruct the stopping position of muons within the sample, thereby significantly enhancing the capability of measuring at higher muon rate. Additionally, we explore the first steps toward a triggerless pump-probe \mSR ~measurement scheme. Unlike conventional pump-probe techniques that require external triggers, a triggerless readout system can continuously integrate stimuli pulses into the data stream, allowing real-time tracking of ultra-fast dynamics in quantum materials. This approach will enable the study of transient states, spin dynamics, and quantum coherence under external stimuli.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation of FASER's Emulsion Detector at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the reconstruction and performance evaluation of the FASER$\nu$ emulsion detector, which aims to measure interactions from neutrinos produced in the forward direction of proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The detector, composed of tungsten plates interleaved with emulsion films, records charged particles with sub-micron precision. A key challenge arises from the extremely high track density environment, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ tracks per cm$^2$. To address this, dedicated alignment techniques and track reconstruction algorithms have been developed, building on techniques from previous experiments and introducing further optimizations. The performance of the detector is studied by evaluating the single-film efficiency, position and angular resolution, and the impact parameter distribution of reconstructed vertices. The results demonstrate that an alignment precision of 0.3 micrometers and robust track and vertex reconstruction are achieved, enabling accurate neutrino measurements in the TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>High-Density Ultracold Neutron Source for Low-Energy Particle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SuperSUN, a new superthermal source of ultracold neutrons (UCN) at the Institut Laue-Langevin, exploits inelastic scattering of neutrons in isotopically pure superfluid $^4$He at temperatures below $0.6\,$K. For the first time, continuous operation with an intense broad-spectrum cold neutron beam is demonstrated over 60 days. We observe continuous UCN extraction rates of $21000\,$s$^{-1}$, and storage in the source with saturated $\textit{in-situ}$ density $273\,$cm$^{-3}$. The high stored density, low-energy UCN spectrum, and long storage times open new possibilities in fundamental and applied physics.</description>

      <title>Irradiation Studies of the Resistive AC-coupled Silicon Detector (RSD/AC-LGAD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive AC-coupled Silicon Detectors (RSDs) are silicon sensors which provide high temporal and spatial resolution. The RSD is a candidate sensor to be used in future tracking detectors with the objective of obtaining '4D' tracking, where timing information can be used along with spatial hits during track finding. 4D tracking will be an essential part of any future lepton or hadron collider and may even be feasible at the HL-LHC. For applications at hadron colliders, RSD sensors must be able to operate in high fluence environments in order to provide 4D tracking. However, the effects of radiation on RSDs have not been extensively studied. In this study, RSDs were irradiated to $1.0$, $2.0$, and $3.5 \times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ (1~MeV neutron equivalents) with both protons and neutrons. The sensors were then characterized electrically to study the acceptor removal and, for the first time in this doping concentration range, the donor removal. Then, the Transient Current Technique was used to begin investigating the signal charge sharing after irradiation. The results suggest an interesting trend between acceptor and donor removal, which is worthy of further study and could assist in improving radiation hardness of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs).</description>

      <title>Quality control of PEN wavelength shifters for DarkSide-20k veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient Wavelength Shifters (WLS) are crucial for Liquid Argon (LAr) dark matter detectors. As they grow larger in volume, the scalability of WLS becomes an important concern. Tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), the most common WLS in use, requires to be deposited with vacuum evaporation, impractical for detectors with very large surface area due to its high cost and energy requirements. The neutron veto of the DarkSide-20k detector will utilize nearly 200 m^2 of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) wavelength shifter, available in the form of large format polymeric foils. In order to assess the quality of PEN sheets in the DarkSide-20k production batch, multiple samples will be tested at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, a new Argon Gas Setup (ArGSet) has been recently commissioned. In this setup, we exploit the Argon scintillation light (128 nm) as excitation for measuring the wavelength shifting efficiency of the samples. In this work, we will present the results of the first measurements performed at cryogenic temperature with this setup.</description>

      <title>APEX: Optimized vertical drift PDS for DUNE FD3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment currently under construction in the US will be a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment dedicated to determining the neutrino mass ordering and to measure the CP violation phase in the lepton sector. DUNE will also perform studies of non-beam physics such as atmospheric neutrinos, bursts from supernovae and nucleon decays in which photon detection systems will play a major role in triggering and also provide calorimetric measurements. For the second phase of DUNE, two additional detector modules will be added in the far detector complex in the Sanford Underground Research Facility. We present the Aluminum Profiles with Embedded X-ARAPUCA (APEX) concept as an advanced proposal for the photon detector system of the third DUNE far detector module. This system aims to have an optical coverage of approximately 60% made viable by the technology advancement achieved by the DUNE collaboration on the use of non-conductive optical fibers for power and signal readout of the photon detector units. Such large coverage will provide enhanced light collection capabilities at MeV-scale energy deposit level per interaction and optimal energy reconstruction resolution up to the GeV scale. The attained electrical isolation of the detector units with low noise levels allows for a complete instrumentation of the field cage walls with satisfactory segmentation as the readout scheme envisages a much larger than typical number of channels to be adopted. We discuss the main features of the system, first estimates on its expected performances, potential for physics measurements and prototyping plans for R\&amp;D.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Compton-PET Imaging for ion-range verification:A Preclinical Study for Proton-, Helium-, and Carbon-Therapy at HIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced-accuracy ion-range verification in real time shall enable a significant step forward in the use of therapeutic ion beams. Positron-emission tomography (PET) and prompt-gamma imaging (PGI) are two of the most promising and researched methodologies, both of them with their own advantages and challenges. Thus far, both of them have been explored for ion-range verification in an independent way. However, the simultaneous combination of PET and PGI within the same imaging framework may open-up the possibility to exploit more efficiently all radiative emissions excited in the tissue by the ion beam. Here we report on the first pre-clinical implementation of an hybrid PET-PGI imaging system, hereby exploring its performance over several ion-beam species (H, He and C), energies (55 MeV to 275 MeV) and intensities (10$^7$-10$^9$ ions/spot), which are representative of clinical conditions. The measurements were carried out using the pencil-beam scanning technique at the synchrotron accelerator of the Heavy Ion Therapy centre in Heidelberg utilizing an array of four Compton cameras in a twofold front-to-front configuration. The results demonstrate that the hybrid PET-PGI technique can be well suited for relatively low energies (55-155 MeV) and beams of protons. On the other hand, for heavier beams of helium and carbon ions at higher energies (155-275 MeV), range monitoring becomes more challenging owing to large backgrounds from additional nuclear processes. The experimental results are well understood on the basis of realistic Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, which show a satisfactory agreement with the measured data. This work can guide further upgrades of the hybrid PET-PGI system towards a clinical implementation of this innovative technique.</description>
