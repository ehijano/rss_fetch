      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Inspect Weakly Coupled Logistic Systems and their Asymptotic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the weakly coupled elliptic system of logistic type, \begin{equation}\label{LS}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u &amp;=\lambda_1 u- |u|^{p-2}u+ \beta |u|^{\frac{p}{2}-2}u |v|{^{\frac{p}{2}-1}}v\mbox{ in }\Omega,
  -\Delta v &amp; =\lambda_2 v- |v|^{p-2}v+\beta |u|^{\frac{p}{2}-1}u|v|^{\frac{p}{2}-2}v \mbox{ in }\Omega,
  \ \ u,v &amp;\in H_0^1(\Omega),
  \end{cases} \tag{$LS$} \end{equation}
  where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with $N\geq 2$, $2&lt; p &lt; 2^*$, and $\lambda_1(\Omega)&lt; \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2$. We say the system is competitive if $\beta&lt;0$ and cooperative if $\beta&gt;0$, for $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$.
  We prove the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the problem \eqref{LS} in alternative variational frameworks, depending on the range of the parameter $\beta.$ We do not rely on bifurcation or degree theory, which have been used in the literature for logistic-type problems. Instead, the novelty is to obtain min-max type solutions by exploiting the different geometry of the functional associated with the logistic problem. In case $N\geq 2$ and suitable values of $p$, we extend the existence results, for all $\beta$ in the whole line, and possibly for the classical case $N=3$ and $p=4$. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of such solutions as $\beta \to 0$ or $\beta \to \pm \infty.$} \bigskip \newline \textsc{Key words: Logistic System, Ground State Solution, Linking structure, seminodal Solution.}{\small}</description>

      <title>A thermodynamics-based turbulence model for isothermal compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new turbulence model for isothermal compressible flows. The model is derived by combining the Favre averaging and the Conservation-dissipation formalism -- a newly developed thermodynamics theory. The latter provides a systematic methodology to construct closure relations that intrinsically satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The new model is a hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations. It has a number of numerical advantages, and addresses some drawbacks of classical turbulence models by resolving the non-physical infinite information propagation paradox of the parabolic-type models and accurately capturing the interaction between compressibility and turbulence dissipation. Furthermore, we show the compatibility of the proposed model with Prandtl's one-equation model for incompressible flows by deliberately rescaling the model and studying its low Mach number limit.</description>

      <title>On the existence of a positive solution to a nonlocal logistic system with nonlinear advection terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal logistic system with nonlinear advection terms \begin{equation*}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl} -\Delta u+\vec{\alpha}(x)\cdot \nabla (|u|^{p-1}u)&amp;=&amp;\left(a-\int_{\Omega}K_1(x,y)f(u,v)dy \right)u+bv\mbox{ in }\Omega,\\ -\Delta v+\vec{\beta}(x)\cdot \nabla (|v|^{q-1}v)&amp;=&amp;\left(d-\int_{\Omega}K_2(x,y)g(u,v)dy \right)v+cu\mbox{ in }\Omega,\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad u=v&amp;=&amp;0\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq1$, is a bounded domain with a smooth boundary, $\vec{\alpha}(x)=(\alpha_1(x),\cdots,\alpha_N(x))$ and $\vec{\beta}(x)=(\beta_1(x),\cdots,\beta_N(x))$ are flows satisfying suitable conditions, $p,q\geq1$, $a,b,c,d&gt;0$ and $K_1,K_2:\Omega\times\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are nonnegative functions, with their specific conditions detailed below. The functions $f$ and $g$ satisfy some assumptions which allow us to use bifurcation theory to prove the existence of solution to problem $(P)$. It is important to highlight that the inclusion of the integral nonlocal term on the right-hand side makes the problem more representative of real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Elliptic and parabolic overdetermined problems in multi-phase settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper provides symmetry results for a class of overdetermined problems of elliptic and parabolic type in multi-phase settings, including various extensions of remarkable results obtained by S. Sakaguchi in [12, 13]. A new alternative approach to proving this type of results is presented, leveraging the weak formulation of the problem. The resulting proofs are direct and elegant, and bring several benefits, including extensions to multi-phase settings (possibly with infinitely many phases) and generalizations to rough interfaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence and non-convergence phenomena in Euler-Maxwell to MHD transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the difference estimate for a class of Euler-Maxwell system and those of magnetohydrodynamics (in short, MHD) systems in three dimensions. We decompose the Euler-Maxwell system into three parts, namely the MHD system, auxiliary linear system and error part system. As a result, we obtain the convergence of the velocity of the fluid $u$, electric fields $E$ and magnetic fields $B$ from the Euler-Maxwell system toward the MHD system in $L^{p}_{t}L^{2}_{x}$ as the speed of light $c$ approaches infinity for $p\in[1,\infty]$. We also derived non-convergence results of electric current $j$ or $cE$, and these results are classified by a certain threshold for $p$. Finally, we investigate how the $L^2$-energy flow of Euler-Maxwell system evolves as c tends to infinity, leading to the vanishing of Amp\`ere's equation in the Euler-Maxwell system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stokes operator with Hodge, Navier, and Robin boundary conditions on domains $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ that are uniformly $C^{2,1}$. Starting with the Hodge Laplacian we etablish a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus for the Stokes operator with Hodge boundary conditions. This entails a H\"ormander functional calculus and boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus in spaces of soleniodal vector fields for the Stokes operator with Hodge boundary conditions. We then establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for Stokes operators with Navier type conditions via Robin type perturbations of Hodge boundary conditions. This implies maximal $L^p$-regularity for these operators and results on fractional domain spaces. Our results cover certain non-Helmholtz domains.</description>

      <title>The Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic problem for the Logarithmic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the non-local analogue of Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type elliptic equations involving the logarithmic Laplacian and critical logarithmic non-linearity.
  In the first part of this work, we derive new sharp continuous and compact embeddings in Orlicz spaces and prove the existence of a least-energy weak solution of the Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type problem involving logarithmic Laplacian. For the uniqueness of solution, we prove a new D\'iaz-Saa type inequality, which is of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems.
  In the second part of the work, depending upon the growth of non-linearity and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of non-local weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that least energy solutions of a weighted non-local fractional problem with superlinear or sublinear type non-linearity converge to a nontrivial, nonnegative least-energy solution of Br\'ezis-Nirenberg type or logistic-type limiting problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Regional and partial observability and control of waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp regional observability results for solutions of the wave equation in a bounded domain of $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in case where the geometric control condition is not satisfied. Assuming that the waves are observed on a non-empty open subset $\omega\subset \Omega$ and that the initial data are supported in another open subset $\mathscr{O} \subset\Omega$, we derive estimates for the energy of initial data localized in $\mathscr{O}$, in terms of the energy measured on the observation set $(0,T) \times \omega$. This holds under a suitable geometric condition relating the time horizon T and the subdomains $\omega $ and $\mathscr{O}$. By duality, we obtain new controllability results for the wave equation, ensuring that the projection of the solution onto $\mathscr{O}$ can be controlled by means of controls supported in $\omega$, with optimal spatial support. We also present several extensions of the main result, including the case of boundary observations, as well as a characterization of the observable fraction of the energy of the initial data from partial measurements on $(0,T) \times \omega$. Applications to wave control are discussed accordingly.</description>

      <title>Higher regularity estimates for solutions to $\infty$-Laplacian-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the higher regularity estimates of solutions to inhomogeneous $\infty-$Laplacian equations at interior critical points. Our estimates provide smoothness properties better than the corresponding available regularity for the model with bounded forcing terms. We explore several scenarios, thereby obtaining improved regularity estimates, which depend on the universal parameters of the model. Our findings connect with nowadays well-known estimates developed for obstacle and dead-core type problems.</description>

      <title>Slicing method for nonlinear integral inequalities related to critical nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called "slicing method" is one of the simple and powerful tools to show the blow-up, as well as optimal upper bound of the lifespan, of solutions to critical nonlinear wave equations by iteration with the logarithmic term. It has made strong advantages in various works on nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs. In this paper, we establish one more example as a short and simple proof of the blow-up theorem for the wave equation with power-type nonlinearities of spatial derivatives of unknown functions. This method may help us to extend the blow-up result for a single nonlinear wave equation to the one for weakly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary vector-valued variational inequality and Lagrange multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of solution of an evolutionary vector-valued variational inequality defined in the convex set of vector valued functions $\boldsymbol v$ subject to the constraint $|\boldsymbol v|\le1$. We show that we can write the variational inequality as a system of equations on the unknowns $(\lambda,\boldsymbol u)$, where $\lambda$ is a (unique) Lagrange multiplier belonging to $L^p$ and $\boldsymbol u$ solves the variational inequality.
  Given data $(\boldsymbol f_n,\boldsymbol u_{n0})$ converging to $(\boldsymbol f,\boldsymbol u_0)$ in $\boldsymbol L^\infty(Q_T)\times H^1_0(\Omega)$, we prove the convergence of the solutions $(\lambda_n,\boldsymbol u_n)$ of the Lagrange multiplier problem to the solution of the limit problem, when we let $n\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of thin-film equations with space-time dependent gradient nonlinearity and apply them to image sharpening. By modifying the potential well method, we overcome the challenges arising from variable exponents and the "moving" Nehari manifold, thereby providing a classification of global existence and finite time blow-up of solutions under different initial conditions. Decay rates for global solutions and lifespan estimates for blow-up solutions are also established. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this class of equations as image sharpening models.</description>

Abstract: Following an analogous procedure with that used in \cite{kogoj_lanconelli_pizzetti}, in turn inspired by a 1909 paper by Pizzetti \cite{pizzetti}, we introduce the notion of {\it asymptotic average solutions} for hypoelliptic linear partial differential operators with non-negative characteristic form. This notion makes every Poisson equation $\elle u(x)=-f(x)$ with continuous data $f$ pointwise solvable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids with shear-rate-dependent viscosity form a special class of non-Newtonian fluids that play a crucial role in continuum dynamics. We consider a compressible barotropic flow of such fluids, governed by a generalized Navier-Stokes system. Due to the nonlinearity in the elliptic term, obtaining the existence of a weak solutions is challenging. To address this, we introduce the concept of a measure-valued solution, whose existence is established in a very general setting using an abstract theorem on the existence of a Young measure. We also discuss the proof of this key result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the phenomenon of monostable pulsating fronts for multi-dimensional reaction-diffusion-advection systems in periodic media. Recent results have addressed the existence of pulsating fronts and the linear determinacy of spreading speed (Du, Li and Shen, \textit{J. Funct. Anal.} \textbf{282} (2022) 109415). In the present paper, we investigate the uniqueness and stability of monostable pulsating fronts with nonzero speed. We first derive precise asymptotic behaviors of these fronts as they approach the unstable limiting state. Utilizing these properties, we then prove the uniqueness modulo translation of pulsating fronts with nonzero speed. Furthermore, we show that these pulsating fronts are globally asymptotically stable for solutions of the Cauchy problem with front-like initial data. In particular, we establish the uniqueness and global stability of the critical pulsating front in such systems. These results are subsequently applied to a two-species competition system.</description>

      <title>The impact of Robin boundary condition on a chemotaxis-consumption-growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis-consumption-growth system with a Robin boundary condition imposed on the signal. First, we analyse the steady state problem, then we show that the solutions of the system are global and uniformly bounded in time in any space dimension. Next, under smallness assumption on the boundary data, we show that the solutions converge to non-constant steady states as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Fractional $p$-Laplace systems with critical Hardy nonlinearities: Existence and Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded open set containing zero, $s \in (0,1)$ and $p \in (1, \infty)$. In this paper, we first deal with the existence, non-existence and some properties of ground-state solutions for the following class of fractional $p$-Laplace systems \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u= \frac{\alpha}{q} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v= \frac{\beta}{q} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha + \beta = q$ where $p \leq q \leq p_{s}^{*}(m)$ where $p_{s}^{*}(m) = \frac{p(d-m)}{d-sp}$ with $0 \leq m \le sp$. Additionally, we establish a concentration-compactness principle related to this homogeneous system of equations. Next, the main objective of this paper is to study the following non-homogenous system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u = \eta |u|^{r-2}u + \gamma \frac{\alpha}{p_{s}^{*}(m)} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v = \eta |v|^{r-2}v + \gamma \frac{\beta}{p^{*}_{s}(m)} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\eta, \gamma &gt; 0$ are parameters and $p \leq r &lt; p_{s}^{*}(0)$. Depending on the values of $\eta, \gamma$, we obtain the existence of a non semi-trivial solution with the least energy. Further, for $m=0$, we establish that the above problem admits at least $\text{cat}_{\Omega}({\Omega})$ nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Apodictic discourse and the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bunyakovsky's integral inequality (1859) is one of the familiar tools of modern Analysis. We try and understand what Bunyakovsky did, why he did it, why others did not follow the same path, and explore some of the mathematical (re)interpretations of his inequalities. This is achieved by treating the texts as discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive structure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky paper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's work (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics. Liouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did not identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere. Grassmann (1862) stated the inequality in abstract form but did not prove it for reasons that can be identified. Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary forms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the inequality that became important in the theory of integral equations. His argument is the source of one of the proofs most commonly taught nowadays. At about the same time, the Rogers-H{\"o}lder inequality suggested generalizations of Cauchy's and Bunyakovsky's results in an entirely different direction. Later extensions and reinterpretations show that no single result, even now, subsumes all known generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability for large times of homogeneous stationary states for the nonlinear Hartree equation for density matrices in Rd for d\geq3. We can reach both the optimal Sobolev and Schatten exponents for the initial data, with a wide class of interaction potentials w (under the sole assumption that w is bounded, including in particular delta potentials). Our method relies on fractional Leibniz rules for density matrices to deal with the fractional critical Sobolev regularity s = d/2 -1 for odd d, as well as Christ-Kiselev lemmas in Schatten spaces.</description>

      <title>Approximation of an optimal control problem on a network with a perturbed problem in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical optimal control problem posed in the whole space R^2 is perturbed by a singular term of magnitude $\epsilon$^{-1} aimed at driving the trajectories to a prescribed network $\Gamma$. We are interested in the link between the limit problem, as $\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0, and some optimal control problems on networks studied in the literature. We prove that the sequence of trajectories admits a subsequential limit evolving on $\Gamma$. Moreover, in the case of the Eikonal equation, we show that the sequence of value functions associated with the perturbed optimal control problems converges to a limit which, in particular, coincides with the value function of the expected optimal control problem set on the network $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for a class of elliptic boundary value problems with $(p,q)$-Kirchhoff type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of infinitely many solutions for the following elliptic boundary value problem with $(p,q)$-Kirchhoff type
  \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{cases}
  -\Big[M_1\left(\int_\Omega|\nabla u_1|^p dx\right)\Big]^{p-1}\Delta_p u_1+\Big[M_3\left(\int_\Omega a_1(x)|u_1|^p dx\right)\Big]^{p-1}a_1(x)|u_1|^{p-2}u_1=G_{u_1}(x,u_1,u_2)\ \ \mbox{in }\Omega,
  -\Big[M_2\left(\int_\Omega|\nabla u_2|^q dx\right)\Big]^{q-1}\Delta_q u_2+\Big[M_4\left(\int_\Omega a_2(x)|u_2|^q dx\right)\Big]^{q-1}a_2(x)|u_2|^{q-2}u_2=G_{u_2}(x,u_1,u_2)\ \ \mbox{in }\Omega,
  u_1=u_2=0\ \ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \mbox{ on }\partial\Omega.
  \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*}
  By using a critical point theorem due to Ding in [Y. H. Ding, Existence and multiplicity results for homoclinic solutions to a class of Hamiltonian systems. Nonlinear Anal, 25(11)(1995)1095-1113], we obtain that system has infinitely many solutions under the sub-$(p,q)$ conditions.</description>

      <title>A $\Gamma$-convergence result for 2D type-I superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2D non-standard Modica-Mortola type functional. This functional arises from the Ginzburg-Landau theory of type-I superconductors in the case of an infinitely long sample and in the regime of comparable penetration and coherence lengthes. We prove that the functional $\Gamma$-converges to the perimeter functional. This result is a first step in understanding how to extend the results of Conti, Goldman, Otto, Serfaty (2018) to the regime of non vanishing Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations Associated with Pseudo-Differential Operators and Hilbert Space-Valued Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the unique existence and investigate the $L^{p}$-regularity of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces associated with pseudo-differential operators, driven by Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes that satisfy certain regularity conditions for the covariance kernels of the Gaussian processes. For our purposes, we develop an $L^{p}$-regularity framework for the solutions to the stochastic partial differential equations associated with pseudo-differential operators. As the main tools, we establish the $p$-th moment maximal inequality for stochastic integrals with respect to a Hilbert space-valued Gaussian process and a Littlewood-Paley type inequality for Banach space-valued functions. Additionally, during our study, we improved the sufficient conditions for Fourier multipliers and examined the covariance kernels for Gaussian processes.</description>

Abstract: We study the initial-boundary value problem for the Boussinesq equation on the half-line. Assuming that the solution exists, we prove that it can be recovered from its initial-boundary values via the solution of a $3\times 3$ Riemann-Hilbert problem. The contour consists of $18$ arcs on the unit circle, $18$ segments and $18$ half-lines, and the associated jump matrices involve $9$ reflection coefficients.</description>

      <title>Morse homology for a class of elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a notion of non-degeneracy which allows to develop Morse theory is generically satisfied for a large class of $C^2$-functionals defined on Banach spaces. The main element of novelty with respect to the previous work of the first and third author is that we do not assume the splitting induced by the second differential at a critical point to persist in a neighborhood, provided one can give precise estimates on how much persistence fails. This allows us to enlarge significantly the class of elliptic pde's for which non-degeneracy holds and Morse homology can be defined. A concrete example is given by equations involving the $p$-Laplacian, $p\leq n$. As a byproduct, we provide a criterion of independent interest to check whether critical points are non-degenerate in the sense above, and give an abstract construction of Morse homology in a Banach setting for functionals satisfying the Cerami condition.</description>

Abstract: We study the perturbed Sobolev spaces ${H^{s,p}_\alpha(\mathbb{R}^d)}$, associated with singular perturbation $\Delta_\alpha$ of Laplace operator in Euclidean space of dimensions 2 and 3. We extend the $L^2$ theory of perturbed Sobolev space to the $L^p$ case, finding an analogue description in terms of standard Sobolev spaces. This enables us to extend the Strichartz estimates to the energy space and to treat the {local well-posedness} of the {Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation} associated with this singular perturbation, with the contraction method.</description>

Abstract: We derive full asymptotics of the modified KdV equation (mKdV) with a higher-order perturbative term. We make use of the perturbative theory of infinite-dimensional integrable systems developed by P. Deift and X. Zhou \cite{DZ-2}, and some new and simpler proofs of certain $L^\infty$ bounds and $L^p$ a priori estimates developed recently in \cite{CLT}. We show that the perturbed equation exhibits the same long-time behavior as the completely integrable mKdV.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions of critical Hardy-H\'{e}non equations with logarithmic term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence, non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions to the following critical Hardy-H\'{e}non equation with logarithmic term \begin{equation*}\label{eq11}\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u =|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{2^*_{\alpha}-2}\cdot u+\mu u\log u^2+\lambda u, &amp;x\in \Omega,\\ u=0, &amp;x\in \partial \Omega,\\ \end{array} \right.\end{equation*} where $ \Omega=B$ for $\alpha\geq 0$, $ \Omega=B\setminus\{0\}$ for $\alpha\in(-2,0)$, $B\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is an unit ball, $\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{R}$, $N\geq 3, \alpha&gt;-2$, $2^*_{\alpha}:=\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N-2}$ is the critical exponent for the embedding $H_{0,r}^{1}( \Omega)\hookrightarrow L^p( \Omega;|x|^\alpha)$, and which can be seen as a Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem. When $N \geq 4$ and $\mu&gt;0$, we will show that the above problem has a positive Mountain pass solution, which is also a ground state solution. At the same time, when $\mu&lt;0$, under some assumptions on the $N$, $\mu$, $\lambda$ and $\alpha$, we will show that the above problem has at least a positive least energy solution and at least a positive Mountain pass solution, respectively. What's more, when certain inequality related to $N \geq 3$, $\mu&lt;0 $ and $\alpha\in(-2,0]$ holds, we will demonstrate the non-existence of positive solutions to the above-mentioned problem. The presence of logarithmic term brings some new and interesting phenomena to this problem.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear diffusion equation of the Gurtin-MacCamy type: existence, uniqueness, and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a nonlinear diffusion process that arises in the modeling of biological population dynamics and extends to applications in thermal diffusion and material sciences. By investigating a power-law governed diffusion mechanism coupled with a time-dependent growth rate, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the associated boundary-value problem within a bounded domain. Our approach departs from traditional methods by transforming the original problem into a simplified elliptic framework, which not only facilitates rigorous theoretical analysis but also paves the way for efficient numerical simulations. In addition to the analytical results, we develop a numerical scheme implemented in Python to visualize the evolution of the population density across time and space. These simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the model's sensitivity to variations in the nonlinear exponent, growth rate, and other parameters. The interdisciplinary nature of our work suggests that the insights gained from the study of nonlinear diffusion may have far-reaching implications, ranging from the control of microbial populations in biomedical contexts to the analysis of energy transport in advanced materials. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of complex diffusion phenomena and offer a novel computational framework that can be adapted to a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the validity of Hopf's Lemma for a (possibly sign-changing) function $u \in H^s_0(\Omega)$ satisfying \[ (-\Delta)^s u(x) \geq c(x)u(x) \quad \text{in }\Omega,\] where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is an open, bounded domain, $c \in L^\infty(\Omega)$, and $(-\Delta)^s u$ is the fractional Laplacian of $u$. We show that, under suitable assumptions, the validity of Hopf's Lemma for $u$ at a point $x_0 \in \partial \Omega$ is essentially equivalent to the validity of Hopf's Lemma for the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension of $u$ at the point $(x_0,0) \in \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^+$. We also provide a slightly more precise characterization of a dichotomy result stated in a recent paper by Dipierro, Soave and Valdinoci.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here some results for the PDE related to the logHeston model. We present different regularity results and prove a verification theorem that shows that the solution produced via the Feynman-Kac theorem is the unique viscosity solution for a wide choice of initial data (even discontinuous) and source data. In addition, our techniques do not use Feller's condition at any time. In the end, we prove a convergence theorem to approximate this solution by means of a hybrid (finite differences/tree scheme) approach.</description>

      <title>Extremizer Stability of Higher-order Hardy--Rellich inequalities for Baouendi--Grushin vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the $L^p$-Rellich and Hardy-Rellich inequalities in the setting of radial Baouendi--Grushin vector fields. We establish an identity relating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating their equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities via an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive Hardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin framework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the $L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing identities rather than inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the fractional analog of the Sturm-Liouville problem on a metric graph using a combination of left Riemann-Liouville and right Caputo fractional derivatives. This combination creates a symmetric and positive analog of the Sturm-Liouville operator. We demonstrated that the operator has a countable number of eigenvalues converging to infinity and analyzed the convergence of the series of the reciprocal eigenvalues, providing estimates for the eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Ground state of some variational problems in Hilbert spaces and applications to P.D.E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a ground state for some variational problems in Hilbert spaces, following the approach of Berestycki and Lions. Next, we examine the problem of constructing ground state solutions $u:\mathbb{R}^{d+k}\to\mathbb{R}^m$ of the system $\Delta u(x)=\nabla W(u(x))$ (with $W:\mathbb{R}^m\to \mathbb{R}$), corresponding to some nontrivial stable solutions $e:\mathbb{R}^k\to\mathbb{R}^m$. The method we propose is based on a reduction to a ground state problem in a space of functions $\mathcal H$, where $e$ is viewed as a local minimum of an effective potential defined in $\mathcal H$. As an application, by considering a heteroclinic orbit $e:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^m$, we obtain nontrivial solutions $u:\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\to\mathbb{R}^m$ ($d\geq 2$), converging asymptotically to $e$, which can be seen as the homoclinic analogs of the heteroclinic double layers, initially constructed by Alama-Bronsard-Gui and Schatzman.</description>

      <title>Stability inequalities with explicit constants for a family of reverse Sobolev inequalities on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a stability inequality associated to the reverse Sobolev inequality on the sphere $\mathbb S^n$, for the full admissible parameter range $s - \frac{n}{2} \in (0,1) \cup (1,2)$. To implement the classical proof of Bianchi and Egnell, we overcome the main difficulty that the underlying operator $A_{2s}$ is not positive definite.
  As a consequence of our analysis and recent results from Gong et al. (arXiv:2503.20350 [math.AP]), the case $s - \frac{n}{2} \in (1,2)$ remarkably constitutes the first example of a Sobolev-type stability inequality (i) whose best constant is explicit and (ii) which does not admit an optimizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a scale-critical trapped surface formation result for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar field (EMCSF) system, without any symmetry assumptions. Specifically, we establish a scale-critical semi-global existence theorem from past null infinity and show that the focusing of gravitational waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the condensation of complex scalar fields, each individually, can lead to the formation of a trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging process along past null infinity, which introduces new difficulties due to the abnormal behavior of the matter fields. Nevertheless, the semi-global existence result and the formation of a trapped surface remain valid.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs under the assumption that the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, by a modified Picard iteration method. Then, we derive the comparison principle by analyzing associated linear BSDEs and further establish regularity results for the solutions. Finally, by combining the regularity results with a localization argument, we extend the well-posedness result to the case where $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. As applications, we derive nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of partial differential equations with Young drivers (Young PDEs), and we also investigate BSDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficient functions as well as linear stochastic heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction $\varphi_U$ when the domain $U$ is a perturbation of a bounded inner uniform domain in a strictly local regular Dirichlet space. We prove that if $U$ is suitably contained in between two inner uniform domains, then $\varphi_U$ admits two-sided bounds in terms of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunctions of the two approximating domains. The main ingredients of our proof include domain monotonicity properties associated to Dirichlet boundary conditions, intrinsic ultracontractivity estimates, and parabolic Harnack inequality. As an application of our results, we give explicit expressions comparable to $\varphi_U$ for certain domains $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, as well as improved Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for such domains. We also prove that under a uniform exterior ball condition on $U$, a point achieving the maximum of $\varphi_U$ is separated away from the boundary, complementing a result of Rachh and Steinerberger arXiv:1608.06604. Our principal Dirichlet eigenfunction estimates are applicable to second-order uniformly elliptic operators in Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and Lie groups of polynomial volume growth.</description>

      <title>\$PINN -- a Domain Decomposition Method for Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Strong Uniqueness by Kraichnan Transport Noise for the 2D Boussinesq Equations with Zero Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inviscid 2D Boussinesq equations driven by rough transport noise of Kraichnan type with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$. For all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of probabilistic strong solutions for all $L^p$ initial vorticity and $L^2$ initial temperature, under the parameter constraint $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 1-1/(p\wedge 2)$. The key ingredient is the anomalous regularity due to the noise proven by Coghi and Maurelli \cite{CogMau} who dealt with stochastic 2D Euler equations. Combining techniques from analysis and probability, we demonstrate how the additional regularity from noise compensates the singularity due to the nonlinear parts and coupled terms.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that the set of flat singular points of locally highest density of area-minimizing integral currents of dimension $m$ and general codimension in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$ has locally finite $(m-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. In fact, the set of such flat singular points can be split into a union of two sets, one of which we show is locally $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-negligible, while for the other we obtain local $(m-2)$-dimensional Minkowski content bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider degenerate quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equations in weighted energy class $\mathcal{E}_{\chi}(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is a quarternionic domain in $\mathbb{H}^n$ and $\chi$ is a weight function which satisfies some natural conditions. Firstly we prove that the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere operator is well-defined for functions in $\mathcal{E}_{\chi}(\Omega)$, in particular $\mathcal{E}_p(\Omega),p&gt;0$.
  Secondly, we prove that fine property holds in the Cegrell type class $\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$. As an application, we prove a mass concentration theorem for the quarternionic plurisubharmonic envelope.
  In the study of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, characterization of finite energy range of complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator was a central problem which aroused the interest of experts in the subject. As a quaternionic analogue, we prove a theorem which explicitly characterizes the finite energy range of \emph{quaternionic} Monge-Amp\`ere operator in the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of time dynamics arising in nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations is an ongoing challenge in numerical analysis, especially once roughness comes into play. Classical numerical schemes in general fail to resolve the oscillatory behaviour in the solution which leads to numerical instabilities and loss of convergence. Dispersive equations, e.g., nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries and wave equations, thereby pose in particular a big problem as in contrast to the parabolic setting, no strong smoothing can be expected, i.e., if the initial data is rough, the solution stays rough which makes their approximation a delicate task. In this review we give an overview on a new numerical ansatz which aims to tackle the time dynamics of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations even for very rough data. This is achieved by a resonance analysis and decorated tree formalism that draws its inpiration from the combinatorics used in the theory of regularity structures for solving singular SPDEs. One can hope to see this formalism applied in other contexts for dispersive PDEs and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular (EMI) model is a novel mathematical framework for cardiac electrophysiology simulations. The EMI model provides a more detailed description of the heart's electrical activity compared to traditional monodomain and bidomain models, potentially making it better-suited for understanding the electrical dynamics of the heart under pathological conditions. In this paper, we derive and verify several analytical solutions for the EMI model. Specifically, we obtain a family of solutions for a single two-dimensional cell in polar coordinates and for a pair of coupled three-dimensional cells in spherical coordinates. We also introduce a manufactured solution for N three-dimensional cells in Cartesian coordinates. To verify the analytical solutions, we conduct numerical experiments using the mortar finite element method combined with operator splitting. The results demonstrate that the analytical solutions are effective for verifying the accuracy of numerical simulations of the EMI model.</description>

      <title>On existence and uniqueness for non-autonomous parabolic Cauchy problems with rough coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:1511.05134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider existence and uniqueness issues for the initial value problem of parabolic equations $\partial_{t} u = {\rm div} A \nabla u$ on the upper half space, with initial data in $L^p$ spaces. The coefficient matrix $A$ is assumed to be uniformly elliptic, but merely bounded measurable in space and time. For real coefficients and a single equation, this is an old topic for which a comprehensive theory is available, culminating in the work of Aronson. Much less is understood for complex coefficients or systems of equations except for the work of Lions, mainly because of the failure of maximum principles. In this paper, we come back to this topic with new methods that do not rely on maximum principles. This allows us to treat systems in this generality when $p\geq 2$, or under certain assumptions such as bounded variation in the time variable (a much weaker assumption that the usual H\"older continuity assumption) when $p&lt; 2$. We reobtain results for real coefficients, and also complement them. For instance, we obtain uniqueness for arbitrary $L^p$ data, $1\leq p \leq \infty$, in the class $L^\infty(0,T; L^p({\mathbb{R}}^n))$. Our approach to the existence problem relies on a careful construction of propagators for an appropriate energy space, encompassing previous constructions. Our approach to the uniqueness problem, the most novel aspect here, relies on a parabolic version of the Kenig-Pipher maximal function, used in the context of elliptic equations on non-smooth domains. We also prove comparison estimates involving conical square functions of Lusin type and prove some Fatou type results about non-tangential convergence of solutions. Recent results on maximal regularity operators in tent spaces that do not require pointwise heat kernel bounds are key tools in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (gDNLS) $$iu_t+u_{xx}=i|u|^{2\sigma}u_x,$$ for small powers $\sigma$. We analyze this equation at both low and high regularity, and are able to establish global well-posedness in $H^s$ when $s\in [1,4\sigma)$ and $\sigma \in (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},1)$. Our result when $s=1$ is particularly relevant because it corresponds to the regularity of the energy for this problem.
  To our knowledge, this is the first low regularity well-posedness result for a quasilinear dispersive model where the nonlinearity is both rough and lacks the decay necessary for global smoothing type estimates. These two features pose considerable difficulty when trying to apply standard tools for closing low-regularity estimates. While the tools developed in this article are used to study gDNLS, we believe that they should be applicable in the study of local well-posedness for other dispersive equations of a similar character. It should also be noted that the high regularity well-posedness presents a novel issue, as the roughness of the nonlinearity limits the potential regularity of solutions. Our high regularity well-posedness threshold $s&lt;4\sigma$ is twice as high as one might na\"ively expect, given that the function $z\mapsto |z|^{2\sigma}$ is only $C^{1,2\sigma-1}$ H\"older continuous. Moreover, although we cannot prove $H^1$ well-posedness when $\sigma\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we are able to establish $H^s$ well-posedness in the high regularity regime $s\in (2-\sigma,4\sigma)$ for the full range of $\sigma\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. This considerably improves the known local results, which had only been established in either $H^2$ or in weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of self-similar algebraic spiral solutions for 2-D incompressible Euler equations for the initial vorticity of the form $|y|^{-\frac1\mu}\ \mathring{\omega}(\theta)$ with $\mu&gt;\frac12$ and $\mathring{\omega}\in L^1(\mathbb T)$ satisfying $m$-fold symmetry ($m\geq 2$) and a dominant condition. As an important application, we prove the existence of weak solution when $\mathring{\omega}$ is a Radon measure on $\mathbb T$ with $m$-fold symmetry, which is related to the vortex sheet solution.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions with prescribed mass for a planar Choquard equation with critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study normalised solutions for a Choquard equation in the plane with polynomial Riesz kernel and exponential nonlinearities, which are critical in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. For all prescribed values of the mass, we prove existence of a positive radial solution by a variational argument, which exploits a delicate analysis on the mountain pass level. Under an additional monotonicity assumption on the nonlinearity, such a solution turns out to be also a ground state in $H^1(\mathbb R^2)$. Our work extends the results by Dou, Huang, and Zhong (J Geom Anal 34(10):317, 2024) to the Choquard setting, improving in several directions those by Deng and Yu in (Z Angew Math Phys 74(3):103, 2023).</description>

      <title>A modified Ricci flow on arbitrary weighted graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified Ricci flow, as well as a quasi-normalized Ricci flow, on arbitrary weighted graph. Each of these two flows has a unique global solution. In particular, these global existence and uniqueness results do not require an exit condition proposed by Bai et al in a recent work [2]. As applications, these two Ricci flows are applied to community detection for complex networks, including Karate Club, American football games, Facebook, as well as artificial networks. In our algorithms, unlike in [5,15], there is no need to perform surgery at every iteration, only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. From three commonly used criteria for evaluating community detection algorithms, ARI, NMI and Q, we conclude that our algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including Ollivier's Ricci flow [5], normalized Ollivier's Ricci flow and normalized Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci flow [15]. The codes for our algorithms are available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Modified-Ricci-Flow.</description>

      <title>Existence of distributional solutions to degenerate elliptic systems for locally integrable forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an existence result and maximal regularity estimates for distributional solutions to degenerate/singular elliptic systems of $p$-Laplacian type with absorption and (prescribed) locally integrable forcing posed in (possibly unbounded) Lipschitz domains. In particular, the forcing terms may not belong to the dual space of an energy space, e.g., $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}$, which is necessary for the existence of weak (or energy) solutions of class $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}$. The method of a proof relies on both local energy estimates and a relative truncation technique developed by Bul\'{i}\v{c}ek and Schwarzacher (Calc. Var. PDEs in 2016), where the bounded domain case is studied for (globally) integrable forcing.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the existence, non-existence, and uniqueness results for nonlocal elliptic equations involving logarithmic Laplacian, and subcritical, critical, and supercritical logarithmic nonlinearities. The Poho\u zaev's identity and D\'iaz-Saa type inequality are proved, which are of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems. Depending upon the growth of nonlinearities and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of nonlocal weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that the least energy solutions of a weighted nonlocal problem with superlinear or sublinear growth converge to a nontrivial nonnegative least-energy solution of Br\'ezis-Nirenberg type and logistic-type limiting problem respectively involving the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for the operator pencil of an elliptic system in an angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model problem of a plane angle for a second-order elliptic system with Dirichlet, mixed, and Neumann boundary conditions is analyzed. The existence of solutions of the form $r^\lambda v$ is, for each boundary condition, reduced to solving a matrix equation. Leveraging these matrix equations and focusing on Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, optimal bounds on $|\Re \lambda|$ are derived, employing tools from numerical range analysis and accretive operator theory. The developed framework is novel and recovers known bounds for Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results for mixed boundary conditions are new and represent the central contribution of this work. Immediate applications of these findings are new regularity results in linear elasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global hypoellipticity and global solvability of systems of left-invariant differential operators on compact Lie groups. Focusing on diagonal systems, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these global properties. Specifically, we show that global solvability is characterized by a Diophantine condition on the symbol of the system, while global hypoellipticity further requires that a set depending on the symbol to be finite. As an application, we provide a complete characterization of these properties for systems of vector fields defined on products of tori and spheres. Additionally, we present illustrative examples, including systems involving higher-order differential operators. Finally, we extend our analysis to triangular systems on compact Lie groups, introducing an additional condition related to the boundedness of the dimensions of the representations in these Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in the parameter of the Mittag-Leffler function and determining the fractional exponent of the subdiffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the strict monotonicity in the parameter $\rho$ of the Mittag-Leffler functions $E_\rho(-t^\rho)$ and $t^{\rho -1}E_{\rho,\rho}(-t^\rho)$. Then, these results are applied to solve the inverse problem of determining the order of the fractional derivative in subdiffusion equations, where the available measurement is given at one point in space-time. In particular, we find the missing conditions in the previously known work in this area. Moreover, the obtained results are valid for a wider class of subdiffusion equations than those considered previously. An example of an initial boundary value problem constructed by Sh.A. Alimov is given, for which the inverse problem under consideration has a unique solution. We also point out the application of the monotonicity of the Mittag-Leffler functions to solving some other inverse problems of determining the order of a fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>Analysis of mean-field models arising from self-attention dynamics in transformer architectures with layer normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical analysis of transformer architectures using a self-attention mechanism with layer normalization. In particular, observed patterns in such architectures resembling either clusters or uniform distributions pose a number of challenging mathematical questions. We focus on a special case that admits a gradient flow formulation in the spaces of probability measures on the unit sphere under a special metric, which allows us to give at least partial answers in a rigorous way. The arising mathematical problems resemble those recently studied in aggregation equations, but with additional challenges emerging from restricting the dynamics to the sphere and the particular form of the interaction energy.
  We provide a rigorous framework for studying the gradient flow, which also suggests a possible metric geometry to study the general case (i.e. one that is not described by a gradient flow). We further analyze the stationary points of the induced self-attention dynamics. The latter are related to stationary points of the interaction energy in the Wasserstein geometry, and we further discuss energy minimizers and maximizers in different parameter settings.</description>

Abstract: We formulate new admissibility criteria for initial value problems motivated by the least action principle. These are applied to a two-dimensional Riemann initial value problem for the isentropic compressible Euler fluid flow. It is shown that the criterion prefers the 2-shock solution to solutions obtained by convex integration by Chiodaroli and Kreml or to the hybrid solutions recently constructed by Markfelder and Pellhammer.</description>

Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <title>Minimal and maximal solution maps of elliptic QVIs of obstacle type: Lipschitz stability, differentiability and optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) of obstacle type in many cases have multiple solutions that can be ordered. We study a multitude of properties of the operator mapping the source term to the minimal or maximal solution of such QVIs. We prove that the solution maps are locally Lipschitz continuous and directionally differentiable and show existence of optimal controls for problems that incorporate these maps as the control-to-state operator. We also consider a Moreau--Yosida-type penalisation for the QVI wherein we show that it is possible to approximate the minimal and maximal solutions by sequences of minimal and maximal solutions (respectively) of certain PDEs, which have a simpler structure and offer a convenient characterisation in particular for computation. For solution mappings of these penalised problems, we prove a number of properties including Lipschitz and differential stability. Making use of the penalised equations, we derive (in the limit) C-stationarity conditions for the control problem, in addition to the Bouligand stationarity we get from the differentiability result.</description>

Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <title>Interface fluctuations for $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the interface fluctuation problem for the $1$D Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by a small space-time white noise. We show that if the initial data is a standing wave solution to the deterministic equation, then under proper long time scale, the solution is still close to the family of traveling wave solutions. Furthermore, the motion of the interface converges to an explicit stochastic differential equation. This extends the classical result in \cite{Fun95} to full small noise regime, and recovers the result in \cite{BBDMP98}.
  The proof builds on the analytic framework in \cite{Fun95}. Our main novelty is the construction of a series of functional correctors that are designed to recursively cancel potential divergences. Moreover, to show these correctors are well-behaved, we develop a systematic decomposition of Fr\'echet derivatives of the deterministic Allen-Cahn flow of all orders. This decomposition is of its own interest, and may be useful in other situations as well.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation formulation for transient electromagnetic transmission problems on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Element Method for Phase Field Fracture Models Based on Recovery Error Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase field model is a widely used mathematical approach for describing crack propagation in continuum damage fractures. In the context of phase field fracture simulations, adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) are often employed to address the mesh size dependency of the model. However, existing AFEM approaches for this application frequently rely on heuristic adjustments and empirical parameters for mesh refinement. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive finite element method based on a recovery type posteriori error estimates approach grounded in theoretical analysis. This method transforms the gradient of the numerical solution into a smoother function space, using the difference between the recovered gradient and the original numerical gradient as an error indicator for adaptive mesh refinement. This enables the automatic capture of crack propagation directions without the need for empirical parameters. We have implemented this adaptive method for the Hybrid formulation of the phase field model using the open-source software package FEALPy. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulations of classical 2D and 3D brittle fracture examples, validating the robustness and effectiveness of our implementation.</description>

      <title>Epidemic outbreaks in structured host populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a heterogeneous host population, the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease, $\cR_0$, is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation operator (NGO). The threshold properties of the basic reproduction number are typically established by imposing conditions that make $\cR_0$ an eigenvalue of the NGO associated with a positive eigenvector and a positive eigenfunctional (eigenvector of the dual of the NGO). More general results can be obtained by imposing conditions that associate $\cR_0$ just with a positive eigenfunctional. The next generation operator is conveniently expressed by a measure kernel or a Feller kernel which enables the use of analytic rather than functional analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>
