      <title>Dynamical Excitation as a probe of planetary origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of compact planetary systems migrating in a protoplanetary disk whose inner edge is sculpted by the interaction with the stellar magnetic field, as described in Yu et al. (2023). We demonstrate that the resulting final distribution of neighbouring planet period ratios contains only a small surviving fraction of resonant systems, in accordance with observations. The resulting planetary architectures are largely in place by the end of the protoplanetary disk phase (within a few Myr), and do not require significant later dynamical evolution. The divergence of planetary pairs during gas disk dispersal also leads to the excitation of eccentricities when pairs cross mean motion resonances in a divergent fashion. The resulting distribution of remnant free eccentricities is consistent with the values inferred from the observation of transit durations and transit timing variations. We furthermore demonstrate that this conclusion is not significantly altered by tides, assuming standard values for tidal dissipation in Earth or Neptune-class planets. These results demonstrate that the observed spacing and residual dynamical excitation of compact planetary systems can be reproduced by migration through a protoplanetary disk, as long as the inner disk boundary is modelled as a gradual rollover, instead of a sharp transition. Such an effect can be achieved when the model accounts for the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk. The resulting divergence of planetary pairs during the magnetospheric rebound phase breaks the resonant chains, resulting in a better match to observations than disk models with more traditional inner boundaries.</description>

      <title>Detection of OH maser emission in the 71-year periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks using the 40-m Thai National Radio Telescope (TNRT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the optical cometary database is extensive, the radio database is limited. The 18-cm OH maser observations of comets allow us to determine (i) the production rate of OH ($Q_{\rm{OH}}$) and (ii) the water expansion velocity, for each comet. To reveal the physical properties of the periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, we conducted the OH maser observations of the comet using the 40-m TNRT (Thai National Radio Telescope) on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, 2024 before the perihelion passage on April 21st, 2024. We successfully detected 1665 and 1667 MHz OH maser emissions from the comet. The average OH production rates of 12P/Pons-Brooks were determined as 4.28$\pm$0.30 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, 5.21$\pm$0.42 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, and 3.36$\pm$0.43 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$ for March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. Combining our results with previous estimates, we find that the OH production rate of 12P/Pons-Brooks shows some fluctuations on timescales of a few days, but gradually increases on longer timescales as the comet approaches the last perihelion. The water expansion velocities of the comet were determined to be 1.55$\pm$0.14 km s$^{-1}$, 1.55$\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, and 2.02$^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the observations on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. The reason why the errors are different is because the signal to noise ratio is different for each OH maser emission. All expansion velocities are consistent with the individual results of the heuristic law (Tseng et al. 2007) within errors.</description>

      <title>High Five From ASTEP: Three Validated Planets and Two Eclipsing Binaries in a Diverse Set of Long-Period Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of five long-period TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), each with orbital periods exceeding one month. Initially identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we extensively monitored these targets with the Antarctic Search for Transiting Exoplanets (ASTEP), supported by other facilities in the TESS Follow-Up (TFOP) network. These targets occupy a relatively underexplored region of the period-radius parameter space, offering valuable primordial probes for planetary formation and migration as warm planets better maintain their evolutionary fingerprints. To characterise these systems, we leverage high-resolution speckle imaging to search for nearby stellar companions, and refine stellar parameters using both reconnaissance spectroscopy and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We combine TESS photometry with high-precision ground-based observations from ASTEP, and when available, include additional photometry and radial velocity data. We apply statistical validation to assess the planetary nature of each candidate and use to jointly model the photometric and spectroscopic datasets with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to derive robust posterior distributions. With this, we validate the planetary nature of three TOIs, including the two warm Saturns TOI-4507 b (104 d) and TOI-3457 b (32.6 d), as well as the warm sub-Neptune TOI-707 b (52.8 d). The remaining two candidates are identified as eclipsing binaries, namely TOI-2404 and TOI-4404. These results help populate the sparse regime of warm planets, which serve as key tracers of planetary evolution, and demonstrate ASTEP's effectiveness as a ground-based follow-up instrument for long-period systems.</description>

      <title>Impact Plasma Amplification of the Ancient Mercury Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter) formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field (~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13 uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode. Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo. Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus) could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal anomaly measurements.</description>

      <title>A decade of transit photometry for K2-19: Revised system architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star K2-19 hosts a pair of Neptunian planets deep inside the 3:2 resonance. They induce strong transit-timing variations with two incommensurate frequencies. Previous photodynamical modeling of 3.3 years of transit and radial velocity data produced mass estimates of 32.4 +/- 1.7 M_E and 10.8 +/- 0.6 M_E for planets b and c, respectively, and corresponding eccentricity estimates of 0.20 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.03. These high eccentricities raise questions about the formation origin of the system, and this motivated us to extend the observing baseline in an attempt to better constrain their values. We present a photodynamical analysis of 10 years of transit data that confirms the previous mass estimates (30.8 +/- 1.3 M_E and 11.1 +/- 0.4 M_E), but reduces the median eccentricities to 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 for b and c, respectively. These values are more consistent with standard formation models, but still involve nonzero free eccentricity. The previously reported high eccentricities appear to be due to a single transit for which measurements taken at twilight mimicked ingress. This resulted in a 12-minute error in the midtransit time. The data that covered 1.3 and 5 so-called super and resonant periods were used to match a Fourier analysis of the transit-timing variation signal with simple analytic expressions for the frequencies and amplitudes to obtain planet mass estimates within 2% of the median photodynamical values, regardless of the eccentricities. Theoretical details of the analysis are presented in a companion paper. Additionally, we identified a possible planet candidate situated exterior to the b-c pair. Finally, in contrast to a previous study, our internal structure modeling of K2-19 b yields a metal mass fraction that is consistent with core accretion.</description>

      <title>Mercury Crustal Magnetization Indicates a Stronger Ancient Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury is the only other terrestrial planet in the solar system with an active dynamo magnetic field (~200 nT at the equatorial surface). Furthermore, Mercury's ~3.9-3.7 billion-year old (Ga) crust is strongly magnetized (~10 nT at ~30-km altitude), indicating the presence of a past dynamo. However, the source and strength of the field that magnetized this crust are unknown. To address this, we performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ancient solar wind interaction with the planetary field and coupled them with thermal cooling and magnetization models. We show that the crustal magnetization was likely produced by a surface field of at least ~2,000 nT, likely &gt;10,000 nT (i.e., ~10x or ~50-100x stronger than at present). Such strong fields likely exclude both the solar wind feedback and thermoelectric mechanisms for driving the dynamo at 3.7 Ga ago. Instead, our results are compatible with the past dynamo being powered by an enhanced energy flux that drove strong core convection.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Sulfur Mystery in Protoplanetary Disks Through Chemical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur is a critical element to life on Earth, and with detections of sulfur-bearing molecules in exoplanets and comets, questions arise as to how sulfur is incorporated into planets in the first place. In order to understand sulfur's journey from molecular clouds to planets, we need to understand the molecular forms that sulfur takes in protoplanetary disks, where the rotational emission from sulfur-bearing molecules in the gas phase indicates a very low abundance. To address this question, we have updated the 2D time-dependent disk chemical modeling framework of Fogel et al. (2011) to incorporate several new sulfur species and hundreds of new sulfur reactions from the literature. Specifically, we investigate the main molecular forms that sulfur takes in a disk orbiting a solar mass young T Tauri star. We explore the effects of different volatile (reactive) sulfur abundances, C/O ratios, initial sulfur molecular forms, and cosmic-ray ionization rates. We find that a high C/O ratio can explain both the prevalence of CS observed in disks and the lack of SO detections, consistent with previous results. Additionally, initial sulfur form greatly affects the ice abundances in the lower layers of the disk, which has implications for comet formation and future observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Origins of Super-Puff Planets: A New Mass-Loss Regime Coupled to Planetary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-puffs are a class of low-mass, large-radius planets that have challenged planet formation and evolution models. Their high inferred H/He mass fractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid atmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent modeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\% less H/He mass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative atmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new quantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that previous studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity regimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a new regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal energy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make super-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a coupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework with a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model to observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their masses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a clear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a combination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off dominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically possess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere, which contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must have intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation $\lesssim 30F_\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Solar Hegemony: M-Dwarfs Are Unlikely to Host Observers Such as Ourselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With no firm evidence for life beyond our solar system, inferences about the population observers such as ourselves rests upon the Earth as a single input, at least for now. Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has become ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two striking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First, the stelliferous period spans ~10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1% of that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs, stars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our existence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two plausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do not produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for observers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop a Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two resolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these observations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of ~1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering $T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most conservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding $M_{crit}&gt;0.34 M_{\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\odot}$] to 2$\sigma$ [1$\sigma$]. Our work challenges the tacit assumption of M-dwarfs being viable seats for observers and, indirectly, even life.</description>

Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Accretion Burst in a Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Object</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$ object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching $10^{-7}$ M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H$\alpha$ line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is $\sim$1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 $\mu m$, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>

Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of Likely Methane Absorption Features in the Optical Spectra of Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.</description>
