      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the resulting internal skein algebras have one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Correlators in Finite Rigid Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients of the torus partition function are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantization of infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Cartier's deformation theorem of braided monoidal categories admitting an infinitesimal braiding to the non-symmetric case. The algebraic counterpart of these categories is the notion of a pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebra, which extends the well-known notion of quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra given by Drinfeld. Our result implies that one can quantize the infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix of any Cartier quasi-bialgebra. We further discuss the emerging concepts of infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Cartier ring, the latter containing braid groups with additional generators that correspond to infinitesimal braidings. Explicit deformations of the representation categories of the gauge deformed quasitriangular quasi-bialgebras $E(n)$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Birational Equivalences and Generalized Weyl Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate suitably localized Hochschild homologies of various quantum groups and Podle\'s spheres after realizing them as generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). We use the fact that every GWA is birationally equivalent to a smash product with a 1-torus. We also address and solve the birational equivalence problem, and the birational smoothness problem for GWAs.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative marked surfaces II: tagged triangulations, clusters, and their symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Grover-Based Quantum Algorithm for Solving Perfect Mazes via Fitness-Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states, and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like or acyclic graphs.</description>
