      <title>Analytical Framework for Evaluating Traffic Capacity Impacts of Electric Vehicles' Regenerative Braking Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01938v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regenerative braking (RB) significantly influences electric vehicle (EV) car-following (CF) dynamics, yet traditional traffic-flow models rarely capture these effects. We introduce a comprehensive empirical dataset comprising 197.5 hours of driving data from 25 drivers across eight EV models to systematically investigate regen-induced CF behaviors. Two primary CF patterns emerge: (i) steady-state scenarios where EVs use regenerative braking and subsequently re-accelerate to equilibrium speeds with larger spacing, and (ii) dynamic scenarios involving lead oscillations, characterized by a distinctive three-phase CF process-regenerative deceleration, transitional plateau, and rapid re-acceleration. The paper's main contribution is the development of an analytical framework that models these EV-specific CF behaviors and quantifies their impacts on traffic capacity. We derive closed-form expressions for the established $\eta$ function from the literature, explicitly quantifying EV driving deviations from stable CF defined by Newell's CF model and assessing their implications for roadway capacity. Validation against empirical data and simulation confirm the model's accuracy ($R^2=0.96$) in replicating real-world $\eta$ trajectories. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that increased RB intensity, prolonged transitions, and shorter reaction delays significantly raise values and cumulative capacity losses. These findings highlight a clear trade-off between enhanced energy recovery through RB and reduced traffic efficiency, providing critical insights for EV-aware traffic modeling, control strategies, and transportation policy.</description>

      <title>The origins of large-scale structure in family networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Family relations are the most fundamental of all social networks and encompass everyone. Family networks grow as individuals have children, creating connections between families, which over time creates large and complex structures. While partner-choice homophily has been proposed as a key driver in this growth process, little is known about the connection between individual behavior and the emergent large-scale structure of family networks. Here, we analyze a unique population-complete family network, covering millions of individuals across several decades, enriched with demographic, educational, and geographic data from high-quality national registries. Drawing on the longitudinal coverage of our observations and using a series of growing-network models, we unravel how individual-level behavior shapes the large-scale network structure. Contrary to prevailing theories, we find that partner-choice homophily has little effect on the emergent large-scale structure. Instead, we identify two key drivers: First, partner-change behavior, where individuals leave one partner for another, creates `shortcuts' in the network akin to rewirings in the Watts--Strogatz model. These shortcuts decrease pathlengths, drive the emergence of tightly connected family networks, and accelerate the emergence of meso-scale connected components. Second, we find that partner change is a self-exciting behavior, such that the probability of changing partner increases with an individual's prior number of partners. The self-exciting behavior accelerates the generation of large network components, with highly connected individuals functioning as network hubs. Accounting for this partner-change behavior, we are able to accurately capture multiple large-scale network properties of the empirical family network. Finally we show that homophily-driven behavior is not able to generate the observed network structure.</description>

      <title>Collective contributions to polarization in political voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Politics around the world exhibits increasing polarization, demonstrated in part by rigid voting configurations in legislatures. The crux of polarization is separation along a unidimensional ideological axis, but how it emerges is yet partially understood. We refine a powerful class of models from statistical physics, restricted Boltzmann machines, to unify two classes of individual voter preference and voter interaction models. Our model is minimally parameterized, fits voting data well, and has parameters that directly give vote probabilities. To obtain this, we account for multi-dimensional voter preferences and the context in which such preferences are expressed to disentangle individual from collective contributions; for example, legislative bills can negotiate multiple issues, whose appeal adds up or competes for individual votes, but whose inclusion involves coordination. With U.S.~Senate voting, we find voters are poorly explained by a unidimensional axis. Senators have multi-dimensional preferences, and, as one consequence, non-polarized coalitions coexist with polarized ones. Polarization arises from both increased party-line voting by individuals and fewer bills that elicit bipartisan coalitions. Both factors contribute over time, but the latter substantially more. Thus, the resurgence of polarization in the Senate includes increasing individual inflexibility, and -- less discussed -- the choice of collective issues on which to vote.</description>

      <title>Long-term resilience of online battle over vaccines and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in "glocal" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards structural interventions.</description>

      <title>The role of zealots in the spread of linguistic traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusion of linguistic innovations on a fully connected network in order to understand the emergence of linguistic diversity. We employ an agent-based dynamics based on the Axelrod model, where interactions between agents are driven by homophily and social influence, with the difference that we assume that all agents share a number of common features that ensure a finite probability of pairwise interaction. We start from a homogeneous population and introduce zealots that act like agents spreading linguistic innovations, without being influenced by other agents. We analyze how different factors, such as the degree of cohesion and number of zealots in different linguistic states, determine the linguistic configurations that populations can adopt and contribute to the possible emergence of a multi-linguistic community. The results are compared with those derived within the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Authorship Attribution in Multilingual Machine-Generated Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA), i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages -- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinarity Revealed by Transitive Reduction of Citation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of transitive reduction on citation networks. Our hypothesis is that documents which lose fewer citations under transitive reduction are likely to be interdisciplinary, while a large loss of citations suggests a document is primarily cited within a single discipline. We test this hypothesis by using an artificial model of a citation network and by using data on citations from three sources: academic papers, court decisions and patents. Where needed, we applied modularity-based clustering techniques on a network defined using bibliographic coupling to classify documents by topic. A cluster-dependent measure was then used to classify the nodes as interdisciplinary or intradisciplinary. Our results provide strong support for our hypothesis in three of the four cases, with somewhat weaker but still positive support in the case of patents.</description>

      <title>Structural properties in the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy: individual people/householder vs firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops two mathematical models to understand subjects' behavior in response to the urgency of a change and inputs from governments e.g., (subsides) in the context of the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy. The first model is a Markovian model of interacting particle systems. The second one, instead, is a Mean Field Game model. In both cases, we derive the scaling limit deterministic dynamics, and we compare the latter to the Italian solar photovoltaic data. We identify periods where the first model describes the behavior of domestic data well and a period where the second model captures a particular feature of data corresponding to companies. The comprehensive analysis, integrated with a philosophical inquiry focusing on the conceptual vocabulary and correlative implications, leads to the formulation of hypotheses about the efficacy of different forms of governmental subsidies.</description>

      <title>Robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Energetic closure of the spatially resolved global food system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated global food system analysis is hampered by the fragmentation of data among food types, processes, and scales. Studies also often neglect the connection to human metabolism -- the ultimate driver of food demand. Here we use a common energetic framework to harmonize data on 95 individual food commodities across food system processes, including production, processing, animal feed and consumption, and estimate human metabolism from body size, demographic, and activity data. We estimate that the share of unmetabolized food calories globally doubled between 1990 and 2019 (from about 10 to 20% of the total calories available for human consumption) as food supply outpaced energy expenditure. Approximately half (51%) of the global population's metabolic demands could theoretically be met by production in the same local 1-degree grid cell (~ 10,000 km2) when holding diets constant. Our open-source framework can be applied to assess strategies to reduce food system inefficiencies from photosynthesis to metabolism while meeting local energetic demands.</description>

      <title>The impact of strong activity disruption on building energetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence shows that biological organisms tend to be more energetically efficient per unit size. These scaling patterns observed in biological organisms have also been observed in the energetic requirements of cities. However, at lower levels of organization where energetic interventions can be more manageable, such as buildings, this analysis has remained more elusive due to the difficulties in collecting fine-grained data. Here, we use the maintenance energy usage in buildings at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2009 to 2024 to analyze energetic trends at the scale of individual buildings and their sensitivity to strong external perturbations. We find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological organisms, large buildings are on average $24\%$ more energetically efficient per unit size than smaller buildings. Because it has become debatable how to better measure the efficiency of buildings, this scaling pattern naturally establishes a baseline efficiency for buildings, where deviations from the mean would imply a more or less efficient building than the baseline according to volume. This relative efficiency progressively increased to $34\%$ until 2020. However, the strong activity disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, removing this trend and leading to a reversal to the expected $24\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic adaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Ising Network Opinion Formation (INOF) model and apply it for the analysis of networks of 6 Wikipedia language editions. In the model, Ising spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion polarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a given spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The main consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\it capitalism, imperialism} (blue opinion) and {\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These nodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their steady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that the global network opinion favors {\it socialism, communism} for all 6 editions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries and political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We also present results for opinion competition between {\it Christianity} and {\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF approach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Cooperation and Self-Interest in a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the gender divide: Authorship and acknowledgment in scientific publications</title>

Abstract: The issue of gender bias in scientific publications has been a topic of ongoing debate. One aspect of this debate concerns whether women receive equal credit for their contributions compared to men. Conventional wisdom suggests that women are more likely to be acknowledged than listed as co-authors. In this study, we analyze data from over 20,000 authors and 60,000 acknowledged individuals across nine disciplines in open-access journals. Our results confirm persistent gender disparities: women are more frequently acknowledged than credited as co-authors, especially in roles involving investigation and analysis. To account for status and disciplinary effects, we examined collaboration pair composed of highly cited and less-cited scholars. In collaborations, highly cited scholars are more likely to be listed as an author regardless of gender. Notably, highly cited women in such pairs are even more likely to be co-authors than their men counterparts. Our findings suggest that power dynamics and perceived success heavily influence the distribution of credit in scientific publishing. These results underscore the role of status dynamics in shaping authorship and call for a more nuanced understanding of how gender, power, and recognition interact in scientific publishing. Our findings offer valuable insights for scholars, editors, and funding committed to advancing equity in science.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative impact on science, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited in enabling genuine scientific discovery. This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component. Evaluations must assess the system's ability to identify novel phenomena, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and efficiently guide experimental programs toward genuine discoveries.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>
