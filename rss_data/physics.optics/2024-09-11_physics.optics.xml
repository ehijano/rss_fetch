      <title>Synthesis by Size Focusing of Lithium Tantalate Nanoparticles with a Tunable Second Harmonic Optical Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics at the nanoscale has emerged as a sought-after platform for sensing and imaging applications. The development of these materials is having an impact on fields that include advanced information technology, signal processing circuits, and cryptography. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) is an attractive nonlinear optical material due to its high optical damage threshold (e.g., tolerance to greater than 500 MW per cm^2 from a nanosecond pulsed laser) and broad range of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) transparency relative to many other nonlinear optical materials. Despite many synthetic reports on metal oxides, very little is known about the preparation of uniform, crystalline LiTaO3 nanoparticles (NPs) of a pure phase, as well as details on their mechanism of nucleation and growth. In this article, we introduce a solution-phase method for the preparation of LiTaO3 NPs with tunable dimensions. This solution-phase process results in the formation of crystalline, uniform NPs of LiTaO3 of a pure phase when carried out at 220 C. This method can prepare crystalline LiTaO3 NPs without the need for further heat treatment or the use of an inert atmosphere. Results presented herein also provide insights into the growth mechanism of these NPs. The reaction included the processes of oriented attachment and Ostwald ripening. The results of our study also indicate that the growth of the LiTaO3 NPs was a result of a size focusing effect, which enables the ability to tune their diameters from 200 to 500 nm. The crystalline NPs were optically active towards second harmonic generation. These studies deepen our understanding of the methods by which NPs can be prepared from metal oxides. These studies specifically demonstrate the preparation of optically active LiTaO3 NPs of uniform and controllable dimensions that could be used in a broad range of fundamental studies and applications in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Modal Statistics in Mode-Division-Multiplexed Systems using Mode Scramblers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical multi-mode fibers exhibit strong intra-group mode coupling and weak inter-group mode coupling. Mode scramblers can be inserted at periodic intervals to enhance inter-group coupling. The deterministic mode coupling of the mode scramblers, in concert with the random mode coupling of the fiber spans, can effect strong random mode coupling between all modes. This reduces both modal dispersion and mode-dependent loss, thereby decreasing receiver complexity and increasing link capacity. In this paper, we analyze the effect of mode scramblers on end-to-end group-delay and mode-dependent loss standard deviations in long-haul multi-mode fiber links. We develop analytical tools in the generalized Jones and Stokes representations. We propose design criteria for mode scramblers that ensure strong end-to-end coupling: the mode-group-averaged power coupling matrix should be primitive and its non-dominant eigenvalues should be near zero. We argue that when the mode scramblers satisfy these criteria, the probability distribution of the system transfer matrix asymptotically approaches that of a system with strong random mode coupling between all modes. Consequently, group-delay and mode-dependent loss standard deviations become sufficient statistics of the eigenvalues of the group-delay operator and the modal gains operator, respectively. We also show that under certain conditions on the uncoupled group delays, it is possible to design self-compensating mode scramblers to reduce group delay accumulation below that of standard strong random coupling.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Inner-Shell Lasing at Angstrom Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the invention of the laser nonlinear effects such as filamentation, Rabi-cycling and collective emission have been explored in the optical regime leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have led to the extension of many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of angstrom scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity. One such example is XFEL driven population inversion of 1s core hole states resulting in inner-shell K${\alpha}$ (2p to 1s) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been utilized for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of next generation X-ray laser sources. Here we show that strong lasing effects, similar to those observed in the optical regime, can occur at 1.5 to 2.1 angstrom wavelengths during high intensity (&gt; ${10^{19}}$ W/cm${^{2}}$) XFEL driven inner-shell lasing and superfluorescence of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal substructure of the XFEL pump pulses, the resulting inner-shell X-ray laser pulses can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities as well as spectral inhomogeneities and broadening. Through 3D Maxwell Bloch theory we show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation, and that the spectral broadening is driven by Rabi cycling with sub-femtosecond periods. These findings indicate that we have generated Angstrom-wavelength x-ray pulses (containing ${10^{6}}$ - ${10^{8}}$ photons) in the strong lasing regime, some of them with pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical sensor network with fiber Bragg gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics offers a versatile platform for both fundamental physics and ultrasensitive sensing. Importantly, resonant enhancement in both optical and mechanical responses enables the highly sensitive optical detection of small forces, displacements, vibrations, and magnetic fields, enabling it a promising candidate of the next generation of ultrasensitive sensor networks. However, this is impeded by the fiber optic-incompatibility and intrinsic nature of existing optomechanical sensors. Here, we report the first demonstration of an optomechanical sensor network in terms of magnetic field detection, wherein multiple fiber-optic optomechanical sensors are connected into a standard single mode fiber. Building upon a commercially available fiber Bragg gratings, we realize a robust low-loss, low-noise, and polarization-insensitive coupling with light sources in a way compatible with fiber optics. This thus enables our optomechanical senor to fulfill the requirements for ultrasensitive sensor networks. Furthermore, in this sensor network we demonstrate the sensitivity of 8.73 pm/Gs for DC magnetic fields and 537 fT/Hz1/2 for AC magnetic fields in a magnetically unshielded environment with the ambient temperature and pressure, better than the reported values in previous optomechanical magnetometers. Our work sheds light on exploiting cavity optomechanics in the practical applications and ultrasensitive senor networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient finite element modeling of photonic modal analysis augmented by combined symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient numerical implementation of the finite element method for modal analysis that leverages various symmetry operations, including spatial symmetry in point groups and space-time symmetry in pseudo-Hermiticity systems. We provide a formal and rigorous treatment, specifically deriving the boundary constraint conditions corresponding to symmetry constraints. Without loss of generality, we illustrate our approach via computing the modes of optical waveguides with complex cross-sections, accompanied with performance benchmark against the standard finite element method. The obtained results demonstrate excellent agreement between our method and standard FEM with significantly improved computational efficiency. Specifically, the calculation speed increased by a factor of $23$ in the hollow-core fiber. Furthermore, our method directly classifies and computes the modes based on symmetry, facilitating the modal analysis of complex waveguides.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach for pure high, even-order dispersion solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically solve the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing the propagation of pure high, even order dispersion (PHEODs) solitons by variational approach. The Lagrangian for nonlinear pulse transmission systems with each dispersion order are given and the analytical solutions of PHEOD soltions are obtained and compared with the numerical results. It is shown that the variational results approximate very well for lower orders of dispersion ($\le 8$) and get worst as the order increasing. In addition, using the linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that all PHEOD solitons are stable and obtain the soliton internal modes that accompany soliton transmission. These results are helpful for the application of PHEOD solitons in high energy lasers.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Multi-layer Metasurface Design: Hybrid Deep Learning Models for Beyond-RGB Reconfigurable Structural Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are key to the development of flat optics and nanophotonic devices, offering significant advantages in creating structural colors and high-quality factor cavities. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLMs) further amplify these benefits by enhancing light-matter interactions within individual nanopillars. However, the numerous design parameters involved make traditional simulation tools impractical and time-consuming for optimizing MLMs. This highlights the need for more efficient approaches to accelerate their design. In this work, we introduce NanoPhotoNet, an AI-driven design tool based on a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. NanoPhotoNet enhances the design and optimization of MLMs, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 98.3% and a speed improvement of 50,000x compared to conventional methods. The tool enables MLMs to produce structural colors beyond the standard RGB region, expanding the RGB gamut area by 163%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of tunable structural colors, extending the metasurface functionality to tunable color filters. These findings present a powerful method for applying NanoPhotoNet to MLMs, enabling strong light-matter interactions in applications such as tunable nanolasers and reconfigurable beam steering.</description>

      <title>Time-varying Nonlinear Effects in Terahertz Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying effects have unveiled new possibilities for manipulating electromagnetic waves through the temporal dimension. In this study, we experimentally explore these effects in the nonlinear optical process of terahertz (THz) generation using optically pumped indium tin oxide (ITO) films. The ultrafast carrier dynamics in the ITO film endow the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (\c{hi}(2)) with sub-picosecond temporal evolution, establishing a temporal boundary for the generated THz waves. We observe significant amplitude and frequency modulations in the THz generation at various transients, attributed to the time-varying complex amplitude of the \c{hi}(2). Moreover, we also observed polarization modulations when further exploiting the tensor properties of \c{hi}(2). This work advances the exploration of time-varying effects into the nonlinear regime through frequency down-conversion, effectively transferring the strong time-varying material response from the near-infrared (NIR) band to the THz band. These findings open up new opportunities for realizing time-varying phenomena that specifically require single-cycle modulation.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>

      <title>Disorder enhanced exciton transport and quantum information spreading with the assistance of cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular materials have been studied as a potential platform for highly efficient transport such as exciton transport and quantum information spreading. However, one detrimental factor to transport efficiency is the inherent disorder of the molecular system, where site-to-site hopping is suppressed by Anderson localization. Here we theoretically report a novel approach to eliminate the negative impact of disorder by strongly coupling the system to a cavity, where the cavity photon bridges spatially separated sites and builds an additional transport channel, cavity-mediated jumping. Our analysis of the open quantum system dynamics shows in terms of long-range transport, the two channels hold a competitive relation. When disorder suppresses site-to-site hopping, transport occurs mainly through cavity-mediated jumping in disguise. Therefore, with the assistance of the cavity, disorder in certain ranges can enhance transport and certain disordered systems can even be more efficient for transport than the homogeneous system. These results provide insight into the design of next-generation materials for exciton transport and quantum information spreading by leveraging hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit Generation via Approximate Squeezed Schr\"odinger Cat State Breeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement based methods can produce high quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than other measurement based methods, while still producing states with high-fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e exciton polaron engineering via twisted hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) exhibits emergent ferroelectricity due to the formation of moir\'e superlattices with alternating AB and BA domains. These domains possess electric dipoles, leading to a periodic electrostatic potential that can be imprinted onto other 2D materials placed in its proximity. Here we demonstrate the remote imprinting of moir\'e patterns from twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) onto monolayer MoSe2 and investigate the resulting changes in the exciton properties. We confirm the imprinting of moir\'e patterns on monolayer MoSe2 via proximity using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and hyperspectral photoluminescence (PL) mapping. By developing a technique to create large ferroelectric domain sizes ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 8.7 {\mu}m, we achieve unprecedented potential modulation of 387 +- 52 meV. We observe the formation of exciton polarons due to charge redistribution caused by the antiferroelectric moir\'e domains and investigate the optical property changes induced by the moir\'e pattern in monolayer MoSe2 by varying the moir\'e pattern size down to 110 nm. Our findings highlight the potential of twisted hBN as a platform for controlling the optical and electronic properties of 2D materials for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Excitonic signatures of ferroelectric order in parallel-stacked MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity, prevalent in various parallel-stacked layered materials, allows switching of out-of-plane ferroelectric order by in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. Its resilience against doping potentially enables next-generation storage and logic devices. However, studies have been limited to indirect sensing or visualization of ferroelectricity. For transition metal dichalcogenides, there is little knowledge about the influence of ferroelectric order on their intrinsic valley and excitonic properties. Here, we report direct probing of ferroelectricity in few-layer 3R-MoS$_2$ using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Contrary to a simple electrostatic perception, layer-hybridized excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moment remain decoupled from ferroelectric ordering, while intralayer excitons with in-plane dipole orientation are sensitive to it. Ab initio calculations identify stacking-specific interlayer hybridization leading to this asymmetric response. Exploiting this sensitivity, we demonstrate optical readout and control of multi-state polarization with hysteretic switching in a field-effect device. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity reveals a direct correspondence between spin-valley dynamics and stacking order.</description>

      <title>Label-free incoherent super-resolution optical microscopy</title>

Abstract: The photo-kinetics of fluorescent molecules have enabled the circumvention of far-field optical diffraction-limit. Despite its enormous potential, the necessity to label the sample may adversely influence the delicate biology under investigation. Thus, continued development efforts are needed to surpass the far-field label-free diffraction barrier. The coherence of the detected light in label-free mode hinders the application of existing super-resolution methods based on incoherent fluorescence imaging. In this article, we present the physics and propose a methodology to circumvent this challenge by exploiting the photoluminescence of silicon nitride waveguides for near-field illumination of unlabeled samples. The technique is abbreviated EPSLON, Evanescently decaying Photoluminescence Scattering enables Label-free Optical Nanoscopy. We demonstrate that such an illumination has properties that mimic the photo-kinetics of nano-sized fluorescent molecules. This allows for developing a label-free incoherent system that is linear in intensity, and stable with time thereby permitting the application of techniques like structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and intensity-fluctuation-based optical nanoscopy (IFON) in label-free mode to circumvent the diffraction limit.</description>

      <title>Multi-Spectral Reflection Matrix for Ultra-Fast 3D Label-Free Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label-free microscopy exploits light scattering to obtain a three-dimensional image of biological tissues. However, light propagation is affected by aberrations and multiple scattering, which drastically degrade the image quality and limit the penetration depth. Multi-conjugate adaptive optics and time-gated matrix approaches have been developed to compensate for aberrations but the associated frame rate is extremely limited for 3D imaging. Here we develop a multi-spectral matrix approach to solve these fundamental problems. Based on a sparse illumination scheme and an interferometric measurement of the reflected wave-field at multiple wavelengths, the focusing process can be optimized in post-processing for any voxel by addressing independently each frequency component of the reflection matrix. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the three-dimensional image of an opaque human cornea over a 0.1 mm$^3$-field-of-view at a 290 nm-resolution and a 1 Hz-frame rate. This work paves the way towards a fully-digital microscope allowing real-time, in-vivo, quantitative and deep inspection of tissues.</description>

      <title>Motion Hologram: Jointly optimized hologram generation and motion planning for photorealistic and speckle-free 3D displays via reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holography is capable of rendering three-dimensional scenes with full-depth control, and delivering transformative experiences across numerous domains, including virtual and augmented reality, education, and communication. However, traditional holography presents 3D scenes with unnatural defocus and severe speckles due to the limited space bandwidth product of the spatial light modulator (SLM). Here, we introduce Motion Hologram, a novel holographic technique to accurately portray photorealistic and speckle-free 3D scenes, by leveraging a single hologram and learnable motion trajectory, which are jointly optimized within the deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrated the proposed technique could achieve a 4~5 dB PSNR improvement of focal stacks in comparison with traditional holography and could successfully depict speckle-free, high-fidelity, and full-color 3D displays using only a commercial SLM for the first time. We believe the proposed method promises a new form of holographic displays that will offer immersive viewing experiences for audiences.</description>

      <title>Sub-meV Linewidths in Polarized Low-Temperature Photoluminescence of 2D PbS Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Advanced Data Processing of THz-Time Domain Spectroscopy Data with Sinusoidally Moving Delay Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive technical analysis of the data acquisition process with oscillating delay lines for Terahertz-time domain spectroscopy. The utilization of these rapid stages, particularly in high-repetition-rate systems, is known to enable an effective reduction of noise content through averaging. However, caution must be exercised to optimize the data averaging process, with the goal of significantly optimizing the dynamic range (DR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we discuss some pitfalls to avoid and the effect of improper data handling on the dynamic range obtainable. A free and open-source program, called parrot (Processing All Rapidly &amp; Reliably Obtained THz-traces), is provided alongside this publication to overcome the discussed pitfalls and facilitate the acceleration of experimental setups and data analysis, thereby enhancing signal fidelity and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered lattices: dimensionality matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08380v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance in ordered atomic arrays is a phenomenon where atomic synchronization gives rise to a burst in photon emission. This superradiant burst only occurs if there is one -- or just a few -- dominant decay channels. For a fixed atom number, this happens only below a critical interatomic distance. Here we show that array dimensionality is the determinant factor that drives superradiance. In 2D and 3D arrays, superradiance occurs due to constructive interference, which grows stronger with atom number. This leads to a critical distance that scales sublogarithmically with atom number in 2D, and as a power law in 3D. In 1D arrays, superradiance occurs due to destructive interference that effectively switches off certain decay channels, yielding a critical distance that saturates with atom number. Our results provide a guide to explore many-body decay in state-of-the art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Electro-Optic Analog Memory for Neuromorphic Photonic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and ADCs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and compares various analog memory technologies for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Steering nonlocality in high-speed telecommunication system without detection loophole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, and is an exploitable resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues and the associated applicability compromises hamper the practical applications. We report the first detection-loophole-free demonstration of steering nonlocality in a fully chip-fiber telecommunication system, with an ultra-fast measurement switching rate (2.5 GHz). In this endeavor, we propose the phase-encoding measurement scheme to adapt the system to the GHz-level modulation rate. We design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation, and devise an asymmetric paradigm to mimic the measurement implementation at the steering party thus avoiding the phase-encoding loss. Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency that is required by conclusive quantum steering with actively switched multiple measurement settings. Our setup presents an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Silicon Photonic MEMS Switch Based on Centrally-Clamped Stepped Bistable Mechanical Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the compact horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch features a 10s us-scale switching speed and a 10s fJ-scale simulated switching energy within a 100*100 um2 footprint, with &lt;=12 V driving voltages. This 2*2 switch can be used in a variety of topologies for large-scale photonic switches, and its nonvolatility can potentially support future photonic FPGA designs.</description>
