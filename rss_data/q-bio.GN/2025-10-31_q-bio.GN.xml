      <title>Integrated Multi-omics Reveals MEF2C as a Direct Regulator of Microglial Immune and Synaptic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Patients carrying MEF2C haploinsufficiency develop a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome featuring intellectual disability, treatment-resistant seizures, and autism spectrum behaviors. While MEF2C's critical roles in cardiac development and neuronal function are well-established, its specific transcriptional operations within microglia (the brain's resident immune cells) have remained surprisingly undefined. This knowledge gap is particularly notable given that MEF2C syndrome patients consistently present with neurological symptoms while cardiac abnormalities are rarely observed.
  Results: We used human iPSC-derived microglia with MEF2C knockout to perform integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. Our data demonstrate that MEF2C directly binds 1,258 genomic loci and regulates 755 differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.05). Integration identified 69 high-confidence direct targets with statistically significant overlap (p = 8.87 x 10^-5). The most dramatic changes included ADAMDEC1, a microglia-enriched metalloprotease for extracellular matrix remodeling (log2FC = -4.76, adj. p = 3.30 x 10^-19), and CARD11, an NF-kappaB signaling component (log2FC = -5.16, adj. p = 5.95 x 10^-5). Pathway analysis revealed profound disruption of Fc-gamma receptor signaling (p = 3.11 x 10^-7), alongside widespread changes in immune response and synaptic organization pathways.
  Conclusion: These findings establish MEF2C as a master transcriptional regulator coordinating both immune effector functions and synaptic interaction programs in microglia. The observed changes, particularly in Fc receptor signaling critical for synaptic pruning, likely underlie the neurological manifestations of MEF2C syndrome.

      <title>Discovering Interpretable Biological Concepts in Single-cell RNA-seq Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.</description>
