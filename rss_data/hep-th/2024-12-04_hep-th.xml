      <title>Topological Cosets via Anyon Condensation and Applications to Gapped $\mathrm{\bf{QCD_{2}}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coset construction of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT) defines a 2D CFT by taking the quotient of two previously known chiral algebras. In this work, we use the methods of non-abelian (non-invertible) anyon condensation to describe 2D topological cosets, defined by the special case where the quotient of chiral algebras is a conformal embedding. In this case, the coset has zero central charge, and the coset theory is thus purely topological. Using non-abelian anyon condensation we describe in general the spectrum of line and local operators as well as their fusion, operator product expansion, and the action of the lines on local operators. An important application of our results is to QCD$_{2}$ with massless fermions in any representation that leads to a gapped phase, where topological cosets (conjecturally) describe the infrared fixed point. We discuss several such examples in detail. For instance, we find that the $Spin(8)_{1}/SU(3)_{3}$ and $Spin(16)_{1}/Spin(9)_{2}$ topological cosets appearing at the infrared fixed point of appropriate QCD$_{2}$ theories are described by $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ triality and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathrm{Rep(S_{3})}$ fusion categories respectively. Additionally, using this setup, we argue that chiral $Spin(8)$ QCD$_{2}$ with massless chiral fermions in the vectorial and spinorial representations is not only gapped, but moreover trivially gapped, with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Localized Black Holes in AdS$_3$: What Happens Below c/12 Stays Below c/12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct asymptotically AdS$_3 \times$S$^3 \times$T$^4$ black holes that are localized on the S$^3$ and co-exist with the BTZ black hole at small positive energies. These black holes dominate the microcanonical ensemble for $ E\leq \frac{c}{24}\left(5\sqrt{5}-11\right)$, suggesting they could represent the endpoint of the BTZ instability at low energies. Remarkably, they also exist at negative energies, where pure Einstein gravity predicts no states and the BTZ black hole does not exist. They appear in the spectrum immediately above $-\frac{c}{12}$ (the energy of global AdS$_3$), and their entropy is a significant fraction (up to 1/2) of the entropy of the free orbifold CFT at negative energies. Our solutions exist in an energy window outside the universal predictable range of the modular bootstrap in large-$c$ CFT$_2$ and, despite their microcanonical dominance, do not dominate in the canonical ensemble. To calculate the holographic entanglement entropy of our solutions, we propose the first recipe that can be applied to arbitrary geometries asymptotic to AdS$_3$ times an internal manifold, and depend non-trivially on its coordinates. We find that our new geometries have an entanglement entropy nearly identical to that of the BTZ black hole with the same energy, despite having different horizon structures. However, they can be distinguished by non-minimal extremal surfaces, which unveil finer details of the microstructure.</description>

      <title>A note on loop resummation in de Sitter spacetime with the wavefunction of the universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the computation of $n$-point correlation functions in de Sitter spacetime, including loop corrections, using the wavefunction of the universe approach. This method consists of two stages employing distinct Feynman rules. First, one must compute the wavefunction coefficients using interactions as vertices. Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using wavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in the first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the question of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained via other methods. By considering a scalar field with an arbitrary potential, we compute $n$-point correlation functions to first order in the potential but to all orders in loops. We find that, although loop integrals in the first stage are indeed IR convergent, the second procedure reintroduces the IR divergence. We discuss how this induces renormalization of the interaction potential such that the final result combining both steps exactly matches the form of $n$-point functions previously calculated with other methods.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Supersymmetry via the Dressing Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that the so-called matter ansatz at the basis of the three-dimensional model of unconventional supersymmetry by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ) is to be understood as an instance of the Dressing Field Method. The latter is a systematic way to exhibit the gauge-invariant, relational content of general-relativistic gauge field theories. It is shown here to be foundational to (unconventional) supersymmetry: The spin-1/2 Dirac field of the AVZ model being obtained as a supersymmetry invariant variable, encoding physical relational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Precision study of the massive Schwinger model near quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a numerical analysis of the massive Schwinger model in the presence of a background electric field. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) approach, we efficiently compute the spectrum of the Schwinger model on a staggered lattice with up to 3000 qubits. As a result, we achieve a precise computation of the critical mass of the massive Schwinger model to five digits using four different 'criticality criteria', observing perfect agreement among them. Additionally, we discuss the effect of a four-fermion operator deformation of the Schwinger model and compute the critical mass for various values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <title>D-Brane Systems in Twisted Holography and SO/Sp Chiral Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of baryon and determinant operators for the chiral algebras obtained from the twist of N = 4 SYM with U(N) gauge group. In the context of Twisted Holography, we conjecture that a dual description should involve a D1-D5 brane system, and we construct from the correlators a candidate dual brane in the form of a derived coherent sheaf in SL(2,C). Extending this analysis, we compute similar baryon/determinant correlators of chiral algebras in symmetric and antisymmetric representations of SO and Sp gauge groups and construct the candidate dual branes. These branes exhibit Z_2 identifications consistent with conjectures relating SO/Sp chiral algebras to Kodaira-Spencer theory on SL(2,C)/Z_2 and the Type I topological string on SL(2,C).</description>

      <title>Banks-Zaks Stabilisation of Non-SUSY Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It appears to be difficult within string theory to obtain genuine scale separation between spacetime and the internal sector. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for scale-separated vacua which hinges on stringy effects that are invisible at the level of effective field theory. We show that (meta)stable vacua can form if a super no-scale one-loop potential combines with generic two-loop contributions to the vacuum energy, in a manner analogous to Banks-Zaks fixed points. Weak string coupling and scale separation arise from the accidental smallness of the one-loop term, which receives contributions only from massive states, relative to the two-loop term. We provide a proof of concept of this mechanism in explicit non-supersymmetric heterotic toroidal orbifolds by balancing the complete one-loop contribution against the estimated two-loop term and numerically minimizing the resulting effective potential in a restricted sector of moduli space. We note that this mechanism is generically possible within any fundamental theory that has a one-loop energy that gets contributions only from massive modes.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which corresponds to a low-temperature expansion in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. We gain analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study observables in the scattering of classical, spinning objects using the KMOC formalism. In particular, we derive formulas to higher order in spin and one loop $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ for the spin kick and momentum impulse. Our derivation method is agnostic to the choice of theory or special conditions, such as the spin supplementary condition (SSC); we only rely on the generic structure of long-range scattering amplitudes of non-transverse, massive spinning fields in the classical limit. We check these formulas for the case of gravity and agree with previous results from the eikonal formalism after imposing a SSC.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and the saturation of wormhole size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals equate the size of Einstein-Rosen bridges in JT gravity to spread complexity of a dual, double-scaled SYK theory (DSSYK). We show that the auxiliary ``chord basis'' of these proposals is an extrapolation from a sub-exponential part of the finite-dimensional physical Krylov basis of a spreading thermofield double state. The physical tridiagonal Hamiltonian coincides with the DSSYK approximation on the initial Krylov basis, but deviates markedly over an exponentially large part of the state space. We non-perturbatively extend the identification of ER bridge size and spread complexity to the complete Hilbert space, and show that it saturates at late times. We use methods for tridiagonalizing random Hamiltonians to study all universality classes to which large N SYK theories and JT gravities can belong. The saturation dynamics depends on the universality class, and displays ``white hole'' physics at late times where the ER bridge shrinks from maximum size to a plateau. We describe extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spontaneous scalarization of black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous scalarization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Scalar (EBIS) model with asymptotically AdS boundary conditions, revealing novel dynamical critical phenomena in black hole evolution. Through numerical analysis, we discover a distinctive ``flip" phenomenon where the scalar field exhibits critical transitions between different stable configurations. These transitions manifest in two forms: a single flip under variations in initial perturbation amplitude or scalar-electromagnetic coupling, and a double flip when varying black hole charge. Near critical points, the system displays universal relaxation behavior characterized by logarithmic scaling of relaxation time, $\tau \propto \ln |p - p_s|$, where $p_s$ denotes the critical initial amplitude. We demonstrate that these transitions arise from the system's approach to unstable AdS-Born-Infeld black hole configurations, which serve as separatrices between distinct stable phases. The Born-Infeld parameter plays a crucial role in this dynamics, with scalar hair vanishing in the strong nonlinearity limit. These results reveal fundamental aspects of black hole phase transitions in theories with nonlinear electromagnetic couplings and provide new insights into critical phenomena in gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>A short review on TBA equation and scattering amplitude/Wilson loop duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review (written in Chinese), we introduce the computation of the minimal surface area in the scattering amplitude/Wilson loop duality, where the minimal surface ends on a light-like polygonal Wilson loop at the boundary of anti-de Sitter space (AdS). Due to its nonlinearity and the complexity of the boundary conditions, directly solving the equations of motion to compute the area is highly challenging. This paper reviews an alternative approach that bypasses the direct solution of the equations of motion and instead uses integrable systems to compute the area. We will provide boundary conditions for the Hitchin system, which is equivalent to the equations of motion, to describe the light-like polygonal boundary of the minimal surface. Starting from the solution of the Hitchin system, we will further derive the Y-system and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations, whose free energy provides the nontrivial part of the minimal surface area. Finally, we will discuss recent developments in this field and provide an outlook for future research.</description>

      <title>Black $p$-Branes in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterotic string theory has nonsupersymmetric branes whose existence is suggested by the cobordism conjecture. We numerically construct static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black brane solutions in ten-dimensional heterotic superstring theories for 0- and 4-branes. These branes carry charges that are measured by Chern classes on the sphere surrounding the branes. For the extremal case, the solutions have a throat region with a linear dilaton profile as expected from the corresponding world-sheet theory. We also construct non-extremal solutions by compactifying the time direction. To verify the reliability of our numerical calculations, we confirm that they reproduce the known analytical solutions for the 6-brane. Our black brane solutions provide evidence supporting the existence of such branes in heterotic string theory.</description>

      <title>Canonical Differential Equations Beyond Genus One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss for the first time canonical differential equations for hyperelliptic Feynman integrals. We study hyperelliptic Lauricella functions that include in particular the maximal cut of the two-loop non-planar double box, which is known to involve a hyperlliptic curve of genus two. We consider specifically three- and four-parameter Lauricella functions, each associated to a hyperelliptic curve of genus two, and construct their canonical differential equations. Whilst core steps of this construction rely on existing methods $\unicode{x2014}$ that we show to be applicable in the higher-genus case $\unicode{x2014}$ we use new ideas on the structure of the twisted cohomology intersection matrix associated to the integral family in canonical form to obtain a better understanding of the appearing new functions. We further observe the appearance of Siegel modular forms in the $\varepsilon$-factorized differential equation matrix, nicely generalizing similar observations from the elliptic case.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Proof of the Gravitational Entropy Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formulation and proof of the gravitational entropy bound. We use a recently given framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. We show here that this submanifold is naturally restricted to obey an entropy bound if the field theory is diffeomorphism-invariant. We prove this restriction to arise by considering the quantum-mechanical sum of paths in phase space and exploiting the interplay of the commutativity of the sum with diffeomorphism-invariance. The formulation of the entropy bound, which we state and derive in detail, involves a functional $K$ on the submanifold associated to $B.$ We give an explicit construction of $K$ in terms of the Lagrangian. The gravitational entropy bound then states: For any real $\frac{\lambda}{\hbar},$ consider the set of states where $K$ takes a value not bigger than $\lambda$ and let $V$ denote the phase space volume of this set. One has then $\ln (V) \le \frac{\lambda}{\hbar}.$ Especially, we show for the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian in any dimension with cosmological constant and arbitrary minimally coupled matter, one has $K = \frac{A}{4G}.$ Hereby, $A$ denotes the area of $B$ in a particular state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-N limit of the BMN matrix model with classical bosonic membranes which have spherical topologies and spin inside the 11-dimensional maximally supersymmetric plane-wave background. First we classify all possible M2-brane configurations based on the distribution of their components inside the SO(3)xSO(6) symmetric plane-wave spacetime. We then formulate a number of simple but very representative ansatze of dielectric tops that rotate in this space. We examine the leading-order radial and angular/multipole stability for a wide range of these configurations. By analyzing perturbations at the next-to-leading order, we find that they exhibit the phenomenon of turbulent cascading of instabilities. Thereby, long-wavelength perturbations generate higher-order multipole instabilities through their nonlinear couplings.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a system of massless fermions constrained to two space-time dimensions interacting via a $d$ space-time dimensional Maxwell field. Through dimensional reduction and bosonization, the system maps to a massless scalar interacting with a nonlocal Maxwell field through a $F \phi$-coupling. The $d=2$ dimensional case is the usual Schwinger model where the photon gets a mass. More generally, in $2&lt;d&lt;4$ dimensions, the degrees of freedom map to a scalar which undergoes a renormalization group flow; in the ultraviolet, the scalar is free, while in the infrared it has scaling dimension $(4-d)/2$. The infrared is similar to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, and the physically relevant case $d=4$ becomes infrared trivial in the limit of infinite ultraviolet cut-off, consistent with earlier work on the triviality of surface defects in Maxwell theory.</description>

      <title>Selective Thermalization, Chiral Excitations, and a Case of Quantum Hair in the Presence of Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect is a well-understood phenomenon, where one considers a vacuum state of a quantum field in Minkowski spacetime, which appears to be thermally populated for a uniformly accelerating Rindler observer. In this article, we derive a variant of the Unruh effect involving two distinct accelerating observers and aim to address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to selectively thermalize a subset of momentum modes for the case of massless scalar fields, and (ii) Is it possible to excite only the left-handed massless fermions while keeping right-handed fermions in a vacuum state or vice versa? To this end, we consider a Rindler wedge $R_1$ constructed from a class of accelerating observers and another Rindler wedge $R_2$ (with $R_2 \subset R_1$) constructed from another class of accelerating observers such that the wedge $R_2$ is displaced along a null direction w.r.t $R_1$ by a parameter $\Delta$. By first considering a massless scalar field in the $R_1$ vacuum, we show that if we choose the displacement $\Delta$ along one null direction, the positive momentum modes are thermalized, whereas negative momentum modes remain in vacuum (and vice versa if we choose the displacement along the other null direction). We then consider a massless fermionic field in a vacuum state in $R_1$ and show that the reduced state in $R_2$ is such that the left-handed fermions are excited and are thermal for large frequencies. In contrast, the right-handed fermions have negligible particle density and vice versa. We argue that the toy models involving shifted Rindler spacetime may provide insights into the particle excitation aspects of evolving horizons and the possibility of Rindler spacetime having a quantum strand of hair. Additionally, based on our work, we hypothesize that massless fermions underwent selective chiral excitations during the radiation-dominated era of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Towards Hamiltonian Formalism for String Field Theory and Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String field theories exhibit exponential suppression of interactions among component fields at high energies due to infinite-derivative factors such as $e^{\ell^2 \, \Box / 2}$ in their vertices. This nonlocality has hindered the development of a consistent Hamiltonian formalism, leading some to question whether such a formalism is even viable. To address this challenge, we introduce a toy model inspired by string field theory, and construct its Hamiltonian formalism by demanding that all correlation functions derived from the path-integral formalism are reproduced. Within this framework, we demonstrate that negative-norm states are eliminated by physical-state conditions, while zero-norm states decouple from the physical state space. This approach provides a novel perspective on the nonlocality inherent in string field theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators from recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express holographic thermal correlators using a recurrence relation of $\{a_n\}$ at $n\to\infty$, building on recent advances in the connection formula for the Heun equation. We consider two gravitational solutions that correspond to distinct states in different subsectors of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and density. The first is the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS$_5$ black hole, which has finite entropy at zero temperature, and the second is a charged dilatonic black hole in AdS$_5$, which has zero entropy at zero temperature. In both cases, we perturb the system with a charged scalar field and express the perturbation equation in terms of the Heun equation. We find interesting moving patterns of the poles of the correlators including eigenvalue repulsions. We discuss the relation between the recurrence relation and the Virasoro conformal block as two equivalent approaches to write the connection formula for the Heun equation.</description>

      <title>Instant Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instant Folded Strings (IFSs) are unconventional light strings that emerge when the string coupling increases with time. A particularly intriguing property of IFSs, especially relevant to cosmology, is that they violate the Null Energy Condition (NEC). In this paper, we begin to explore their cosmological effects. We find that NEC violation by IFSs is significantly suppressed in an expanding universe, leading to a universe that resembles our own, comprising matter, radiation, and dark energy. Upon closer examination, these components exhibit subtle, nonstandard traits that could be experimentally tested in the future. Notably, the origin of dark energy stems not only from the potential, as is usually the case, but also from the derivative of the potential with respect to the dilaton. This paves the way for a new approach to realizing inflation within string theory, addressing the Dine-Seiberg problem associated with dilaton stabilization, and perhaps even hinting at a novel mechanism to tackle the cosmological constant problem. Conversely, in a contracting universe, the effects of IFSs are amplified, making bouncing cosmologies a natural and prevalent outcome.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relation between the Dirac bracket (DB) and Nambu bracket (NB) is presented. The Nambu bracket can be related with Dirac bracket if we can write the DB as a generalized Poisson structure. The NB associated with DB have all the standard properties of the original DB. When the dimension of the phase space is $s+2$ where $s$ is the number of second class constraints, the associated Nambu structure has $s+2$ entries and reduces to the Dirac bracket when $s$ of its entries are fixed to be the second class constraints. In general, when the dimension of phase space is $d=r+s$ a new Nambu structure that describes correctly the constrained dynamics can also be constructed but in thsi case addicional conditidionts are requiered. In that case the associated NB corresponds to a ``Dirac-Nambu'' bracket with $r$ entries.</description>

      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes in non-perturbative quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-pertrubative quantum gravity formulated as a unitary four-dimensional theory suggests that certain amount of non-locality, such as infinite-derivative operators, can be present in the action, in both cases of Analytic Infinite Derivative gravity and Asymptotically Safe gravity. Such operators lead to the emergence of Background Induced States on top of any background deviating from the flat spacetime. Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) corresponding to these excitations are analyzed in the present paper with the use of an example of a static nearly Schwarzschild black hole. We mainly target micro-Black Holes, given that they are strongly affected by the details of UV completion for gravity, while real astrophysical black holes can be well described in EFT framework. We find that frequencies of QNMs are deviating from those in a General Relativity setup and, moreover, that the unstable QNMs are also possible. This leads to the necessity of constraints on gravity modifications or lower bounds on masses of the stable micro-Black Holes or both.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Gauge Theory from the Top Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of dualities between certain non-supersymmetric self-dual gauge theories on a large class of $4d$ self-dual asymptotically flat backgrounds, and the large $N$ limit of an independently defined $2d$ chiral defect CFT. Our construction goes via twisted holography for the type I topological string on a Calabi-Yau five-fold which fibres over twistor space. In particular, we show that single-trace operators of the $2d$ defect CFT are in bijection with states of the celestial chiral algebra. We match the operator products of these states with the collinear splitting amplitudes of the self-dual gauge theory up to one-loop. Assigning vacuum expectations to central operators in the boundary theory computes bulk amplitudes on self-dual backgrounds. We are able to extract form factors from these amplitudes, which we use to give a simple closed formula for certain $n$-point two-loop all $+$ amplitudes in $\mathrm{SU}(K) \times \mathrm{SU}(R)$ gauge theory coupled to bifundamental massless fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational decoupling using the extended minimal geometric deformation, a new family of static and rotating ``hairy'' black holes is provided. The background of these models is a generic Schwarzschild metric containing as special cases, the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Reissner-Nordstrom and Reissner-Nordstrom-dS black holes. Assuming the Kerr-Schild condition and a general equation of state, the unknown matter sector is solved given rise to black hole space-times without a Cauchy horizon, transforming the original time-like singularity of the Reissner-Nordstrom and Reissner-Nordstrom-dS black holes into a space-like singularity. This fact is preserved for the rotating version of all these solutions.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity II: Near-extremal merger remnants and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc], we initiated a study of high-energy interactions of charged binary black holes near the scattering threshold, focusing on zoom-whirl orbits. In this second paper in our series, we focus on merger remnant properties and energetics with new simulations of equal-mass, equal-charge, nonspinning binary black holes with variable impact parameter. We find near-extremal merger remnants with Kerr-Newman parameter reaching $\Upsilon_f = 0.97$, and observe that the maximum $\Upsilon_f$ increases monotonically with $\lambda$ for a fixed initial Lorentz factor. We find that binaries with larger $\lambda$ radiate less total energy despite having stronger electromagnetic emission. The maximum energy radiated by a binary in our study is $31\%$ of its gravitational mass. Increasing $\lambda$ has little effect on the maximum angular momentum radiated, which was $\approx 72\%$ of the spacetime total angular momentum for each $\lambda$ explored here. Lastly, we provide additional evidence for the universality with the irreducible mass that we discovered in arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc]. The black hole horizon areal radius determines a fundamental, gauge-invariant length scale governing BH interactions near the scattering threshold.</description>

      <title>Universal microscopic descriptions for statistics of particles and extended excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as a quantum instrument. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and also provides a fundamental test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline a quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the corresponding lattice QCD Hamiltonian. This method is equivalent to the Lanczos procedure introduced recently (Wagman-2024), but more general and simpler to implement. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by calculating the two lowest energy levels of a large number of hadrons including a few nuclei. While the signal-to-noise problem does not improve significantly, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable, compared to those extracted by conventional methods. Within a given statistical dataset the proposed method can effectively account for both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the fitting window, and hence can reliably be employed in lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Low-curvature quantum corrections from unitary evolution of de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity (GR), gravitational memory describes the lasting change in the separation and relative velocity of freely-falling detectors after the passage of gravitational waves (GWs). The phenomenon is intimately related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetries at future null infinity. In this paper, we elucidate the relation between BMS transformations and the description of gravitational memory in synchronous coordinates, commonly used in GW detectors like LISA. We show that gravitational memory corresponds to large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, such as volume-preserving spatial rescalings. We derive the associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions. The latter are exactly the flat space analogues of the well-known cosmological consistency relations.</description>

      <title>Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic regularization for massive and massless spin-$1$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic regularization method is likely the most direct and intuitive renormalization scheme for FLRW cosmologies. The method requires one to start with a nonvanishing mass, but massless theories can be studied by taking the massless limit at the end of the calculations. For spin-$1$, however, this limit changes the number of degrees of freedom, so it cannot be performed directly. In this work, we show a direct approach that begins with the canonical quantization of the physical degrees of freedom of a massive Proca field. We give the details of the construction and show that, in the massless limit, the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the Proca field is closely related to that of a minimally coupled scalar field. For completeness and pedagogical purposes, we also include a brief orientation to the adiabatic method for scalar fields. The construction of the adiabatic subtractions in momentum space is compared with that of the BPHZ method for renormalizing Feynman loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We construct {\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic refinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including the Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely $G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by $G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on Topological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and discusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting divisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Following the recently proposed stable and causal first-order relativistic hydrodynamics by Bemfica, Disconzi, and Noronha, we find the heat flow equation in the presence of gravity for a non-viscous fluid, which suffers heat dissipation. The derivation is confined to static and stationary backgrounds. We find that in the presence of gravity, the heat flux times a redshift factor is conserved. Then for radial heat flow, the temperature profiles are obtained from the heat equation when the gravity is sourced by Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Kerr and Kerr-dS black holes, respectively. Consequently, the chemical potential profile is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: The mass spectra of light-flavor mesons are analyzed in a deformed AdS/QCD soft-wall model, driven by four distinct anomalous 5-dimensional mass corrections of the scalar field, coupled to Einstein--Hilbert gravity, from the QCD running coupling. Using the differential configurational entropy (DCE) underlying the families of pseudoscalar, axial-vector, scalar, and vector mesons, the mass spectra of heavier meson resonances with radial quantum numbers beyond the ones already in the summary table of Particle Data Group (PDG) are then estimated. This protocol merges AdS/QCD and experimental data in PDG through Regge-like trajectories. Some of the estimated meson resonances may be identified as further candidates omitted from the summary table in PDG.</description>

Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

Abstract: I discuss chiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit $m\to 0$ of QCD with two light quark flavours of mass $m$, focussing on its consequences for scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities, and on the resulting constraints on the Dirac spectrum. I show that $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry remains broken in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase if the spectral density $\rho(\lambda;m)$ develops a singular near-zero peak, tending to $O(m^4)/\lambda$ in the chiral limit. Moreover, $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ restoration requires that the number of modes in the peak be proportional to the topological susceptibility, indicating that such a peak must be of topological origin.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

Abstract: We study the cohomology of local BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory. The finite $N$ cohomologies consist of the graviton part (subject to the stringy exclusion principle) and the rest which may describe black hole microstates in quantum AdS/CFT. We construct an infinite tower of non-graviton cohomologies in the $SU(2)$ theory and study to what extent they simulate quantum black holes. We find signals for partial no-hair behaviors by showing that certain gravitons are forbidden to dress these cohomologies. This is in qualitative agreement with the perturbative hairs allowed around black holes, which also leads us to a natural setup to construct hairy BPS black holes. The cohomologies are simpler to study in the BMN matrix model truncation of the classical field theory.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Effect of scalar condensation on fermionic pole-skipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the holographic fermionic pole-skipping phenomena for a class of interacting theory in a charged AdS black hole background. We have studied two types of fermion-scalar interactions in the bulk: Dipole and Yukawa type interaction. Depending upon the interaction we introduced both real and charged scalar fields. We have particularly analyzed the effect of scalar condensation on the fermionic pole-skipping points and discussed their behaviour near critical temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present the geometric approach to supergravity. In the first part, we discuss in some detail the peculiarities of the approach and apply the formalism to the case of pure supergravity in four space-time dimensions. In the second part, we extend the discussion to theories in higher dimensions, which include antisymmetric tensors of degree higher than one, focussing on the case of eleven dimensional space-time. Here, we report the formulation first introduced in 1981 by R. D'Auria and P. Fr\`e, corresponding to a generalization of a Chevalley-Eilenberg Lie algebra, together with some more recent results, pointing out the relation of the formalism with the mathematical framework of $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in the presence of a cosmological constant: analytic and machine learning results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. For a certain solution subspace, we demonstrate partial integrability by showing that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a linear system. Subsequently, we study the integrability of these two-dimensional models from a complementary one-dimensional point of view, framed in terms of Liouville integrability. In this endeavour, we employ various machine learning techniques to systematise our search for numerical Lax pair matrices for these models, as well as conserved currents expressed as functions of phase space variables.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a charged AdS black holes with global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By regarding the Newton constant $G_{N}$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as variables, we in this paper study the thermodynamics and phase transition of Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with global monopole in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. It is found that there are interesting critical phenomena and phase behaviors in the (grand) canonical ensembles of fixed ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},C$), ($\tilde \Phi,{\cal V},C$) and ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},\mu$). When the other parameters are fixed, the free energy decreases with the global monopole increases. In ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},C$) ensemble, the range of unstable region decreases with the increase of global monopole. In ($\tilde \Phi,{\cal V},C$) ensemble, when $\tilde{\Phi} &lt; \Phi_{c}$, the free energy appears two branches, the upper and lower branches correspond to low entropy and high entropy respectively. When ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},\mu$) is fixed, a new zero-order phase transition occurs in the high-entropy phase and the low-entropy phase at certain $\mu$-dependent temperatures. When $\mu$ increases to a certain value, this zero-order phase transition disappears. This certain value is negatively related to the magnitude of the global monopole. Finally, we find that $p-\cal V$ criticality does not appear with the change of global monopole. Therefore, it is important to note that the CFT states of charged black holes with global monopole do not correspond to Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we find that charged black holes with global monopoles can better reflect thermodynamic phase transitions and critical phenomena under the AdS/CFT correspondence. By adjusting the change of the global monopole, the thermodynamic phase transition will also change.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the duality between gravitational dynamics and fluids living on dynamical surfaces carrying multiple charges, known as the blackfold approach, to perturbativaly construct new asymptotically global (Anti)-de Sitter multi-spinning, non-extremal, multi-charged black holes in theories of higher-dimensional gravity minimally coupled to a dilaton and higher-form gauge fields in spacetime dimensions $D\ge5$, and new asymptotically AdS$_{l}\times S^{m}$ black holes in type IIB and eleven-dimensional supergravity. These solutions include the generalisation of the Kerr-Newman solution to (A)dS carrying either electric or string charge, generalisations of black rings to higher-dimensions with $\mathbb{S}^p\times \mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ horizon topology, static de Sitter solutions carrying arbitrary $q$-brane charge, as well as various asymptotically AdS$_{l}\times S^{m}$ multi-charged and multi-spinning black hole solutions, some of which correspond to novel thermal states in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Consistency conditions for O-plane unsmearing from second-order perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-separated AdS compactifications of string theory can be constructed at the two-derivative supergravity level in the presence of smeared orientifold planes. The unsmearing corrections are known to leading order in the large volume, weak coupling limit. However, first-order perturbative approximations of non-linear problems can often produce spurious solutions, which are only weeded out by additional consistency conditions imposed at higher orders. In this work, we revisit the unsmearing procedure and present consistency conditions obtained from the second order warp factor and dilaton equations. This requires proper treatment of the near-source singularities. The resulting conditions appear as integral constraints on various non-linear combinations of the first order corrections, which we argue can generally be satisfied by appropriate choice of integration constants of the leading-order solutions. This provides a non-trivial consistency check for the perturbative unsmearing procedure and supports the existence of scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory.</description>

Abstract: We develop the pole-skipping structure in de Sitter (dS) spacetime and find that their leading frequencies satisfy the relation $\omega_{dS}=i2\pi T_{dS}(1-s)$, where $T_{dS}=1/2\pi L$ and $s$ denotes spin. In the two-dimensional dS spacetime, the pole-skipping points near the cosmic horizon $r=L$ for the scalar field of spin-0 and the fermionic field of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ correspond one-to-one with those in the classical limit as $\lambda\rightarrow 0$ in double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model when the temperature is infinite (DSSYK$_\infty$). This provides a numerical correspondence between the static patch of two-dimensional dS spacetime and the DSSYK$_\infty$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>From Black Strings to Fundamental Strings: Non-uniformity and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the transition between black strings and fundamental strings in the presence of a compact dimension, $\mathbb{S}^1_z$. In particular, we study the Horowitz-Polchinski effective field theory in $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}^1_z$, with a reduction on the Euclidean time circle $\mathbb{S}_\tau^1$. The classical solution of this theory describes a bound state of self-gravitating strings, known as a ``string star'', in Lorentzian spacetime. By analyzing non-uniform perturbations to the uniform solution, we identify the critical mass at which the string star becomes unstable towards non-uniformity along the spatial circle (i.e., Gregory-Laflamme instability) and determine the order of the associated phase transition. For $3\le d&lt;4$, we argue that at the critical mass, the uniform string star can transition into a localized black hole. More generally, we describe the sequence of transitions from a large uniform black string as its mass decreases, depending on the value of $d$. Additionally, using the $SL(2)_k/U(1)$ model in string theory, we show that for sufficiently large $d$, the uniform black string is stable against non-uniformity before transitioning into fundamental strings. We also present a novel solution that exhibits double winding symmetry breaking in the asymptotically $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}^1_\tau\times\mathbb{S}^1_z$ Euclidean spacetime.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to Charged Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent work of Brown et al. (arXiv:2411.03447) demonstrated that the low-temperature evaporation rate of a large near-extremal charged black hole is significantly reduced from semiclassical expectations. The quantum corrections responsible for the deviation come from Schwarzian modes of an emergent Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity description of the near-horizon geometry of the black hole. Using a one-parameter family of non-perturbative Airy completions, we extend these results to incorporate non-perturbative effects. At large parameter value, the non-perturbative evaporation rate is even smaller than the perturbative JT gravity results. The disparity becomes especially pronounced at very low energies, where the non-perturbative neutral Hawking flux is suppressed by a double exponential in the entropy of the black hole, effectively stopping its evaporation until the next charged particle is emitted via the Schwinger effect. We also explore an alternative family of Bessel completions for which the non-perturbative energy flux exceeds the perturbative JT gravity prediction.</description>

Abstract: We show that the mass-shell constraints in the gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle given in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 045016 (2016)] are incorporated in an action automatically by extending the local $U(2)$ transformation to its inhomogeneous extension denoted by $IU(2)$. Therefore it turns out that all the necessary constraints are incorporated into an action by virtue of the local $IU(2)$ symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>Eleven-dimensional supergravity as a Calabi-Yau twofold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a generalization of Poisson-Chern-Simons theory, defined on any supermanifold equipped with an appropriate filtration of the tangent bundle. Our construction recovers interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity in Cederwall's formulation, as well as all possible twists of the theory, and does so in a uniform and geometric fashion. Among other things, this proves that Costello's description of the maximal twist is the twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity in its pure spinor description. It also provides a pure spinor lift of the interactions in the minimally twisted theory. Our techniques enhance the BV formulation of the interactions of each theory to a homotopy Poisson structure by defining a compatible graded-commutative product; this suggests interpretations in terms of deformations of geometric structures on superspace, and provides some concrete evidence for a first-quantized origin of the theories.</description>

      <title>Unveiling New Phases of the Standard Model Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present evidence for new phases of the Standard Model Higgs potential. We study the Standard Model physical trajectory accounting for the Higgs curvature mass with the mass-dependent functional renormalisation group. New unstable and non-trivially stable phases are found at energies above the Planck scale and below the Abelian Landau pole. While the first aggravates the well-known metastable phase and threatens the viability of the Standard Model extrapolated to arbitrary scales, the latter can provide a well-defined ultraviolet completion. We investigate the phase diagram as a function of the top quark pole mass and study the effect of new physics through a scalar singlet portal coupling. The new non-trivial phase appears below the Planck scale in extensions of the Standard Model seeking stable trajectories. These findings have a significant impact on existing model building.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum Distributions from Lattice QCD without Wilson Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), which are defined by gauge-invariant 3D parton correlators with staple-shaped lightlike Wilson lines, can be calculated from quark and gluon correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge on a Euclidean lattice. These quantities can be expressed gauge-invariantly as the correlators of Coulomb-gauge-dressed fields, which reduce to the standard TMD correlators under principal-value prescription in the infinite boost limit. In the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory, a quasi-TMD defined from such correlators in a large-momentum hadron state can be matched to the TMD via a factorization formula, whose exact form is derived using Soft Collinear Effective Theory and verified at one-loop order. Compared to the currently used gauge-invariant correlators, this new method can substantially improve statistical precision and simplify renormalization for the time-reversal-even TMDs, which will greatly enhance the predicative power of lattice QCD in the non-perturbative region.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

      <title>Complex structures of boson stars and anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for nonprecessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasinormal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian process regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

      <title>UV Completion of Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as they are absent in the SM and are first generated by dimension-8 operators in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We study the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like heavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC vertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit. Such fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy fermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce dimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields, which are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating off-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients and in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In the heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by conventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic corrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics via nTGCs at the high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements in the Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravitational Perturbations: from Bertotti-Robinson to Extreme Reissner-Nordstrom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric spacetime perturbations induced by a neutral scalar in the near-horizon region of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. For the unperturbed black hole, the near-horizon region is given by another exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, namely the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Our aim is to extend this connection beyond the background level and identify perturbations of a Bertotti-Robinson spacetime as near-horizon perturbations of an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explain that explicit identification of the perturbative solutions to the two different backgrounds can only work in appropriate gauges. For this reason, we first solve the two perturbation problems in the most general spherically symmetric gauges and then find the necessary gauge conditions for matching the Reissner-Nordstrom and Bertotti-Robinson perturbative solutions in the near-horizon limit.</description>
