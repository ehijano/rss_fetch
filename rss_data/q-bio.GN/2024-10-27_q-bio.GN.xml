      <title>Hypothalamic expression analysis of m6A RNA methylation associated genes suggests a potential role of epitransciptomics in sexual maturation of Atlantic salmon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Better understanding the molecular processes contributing to variation in maturation timing is important for Atlantic salmon aquaculture, as early maturation causes considerable financial losses. The m6A RNA methylation is a conserved and dynamically reversible mechanism controlling gene expression in a myriad of biological processes. The role of m6A methylation in sexual maturation, however, has remained largely unexplored and has never been studied in Atlantic salmon. While the maturation process is known to be affected by many genetic and environmental factors, the molecular mechanisms causing variation in the timing of maturation are still poorly understood. Hence, investigation of whether a widespread mechanism like m6A methylation could be involved in controlling of the maturation timing is warranted. In salmon, two genes, also associated with age at maturity in humans, vgll3 and six6, have been shown to play an important role in maturation timing. In this study, we investigated the expression of 16 genes involved in the regulation of m6A RNA methylation in the hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon with different homozygous combinations of late and early alleles for vgll3 and six6 genes. We found differential expression of ythdf2.2, an m6A reader promoting mRNA degradation, with higher expression in six6*LL compared to other genotypes as well as in immature compared to mature males. In addition, we found that the expression levels of genes coding for an eraser, alkbh5, and for a reader, ythdf1, were higher in the hypothalamus of females than in males across all the different genotypes studied. However the total m6A levels between the whole hypothalamus of males and females were similar. Our results indicate a potential role of the m6A methylation process in sexual maturation of salmon, and provide the first evidence for such regulatory mechanism in the hypothalamus of any vertebrate</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains All-order Feature Interactions in Black-box Genomic Models with Near-zero Query Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of black-box models in machine learning, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. Shapley values locally explain a model to an input query using additive features. Yet, in genomics, extracting biological knowledge from black-box models hinges on explaining nonlinear feature interactions globally to hundreds to thousands of input query sequences. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, an algorithm that estimates all-order Shapley feature interactions with a near-zero cost per queried sequence after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcomes, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. SHAP zero reveals all microhomologous motifs that are predictive of DNA repair outcome, a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible high-order feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.
