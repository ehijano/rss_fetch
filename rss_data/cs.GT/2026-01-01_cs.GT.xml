      <title>Personalized Promotions in Practice: Dynamic Allocation and Reference Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partnering with a large online retailer, we consider the problem of sending daily personalized promotions to a userbase of over 20 million customers. We propose an efficient policy for determining, every day, the promotion that each customer should receive (10%, 12%, 15%, 17%, or 20% off), while respecting global allocation constraints. This policy was successfully deployed to see a 4.5% revenue increase during an A/B test, by better targeting promotion-sensitive customers and also learning intertemporal patterns across customers.
  We also consider theoretically modeling the intertemporal state of the customer. The data suggests a simple new combinatorial model of pricing with reference effects, where the customer remembers the best promotion they saw over the past $\ell$ days as the "reference value", and is more likely to purchase if this value is poor. We tightly characterize the structure of optimal policies for maximizing long-run average revenue under this model -- they cycle between offering poor promotion values $\ell$ times and offering good values once.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Fair Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of multilevel fair allocation of resources with tree-structured hierarchical relations among agents. While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.</description>

      <title>On the Difficulty of Measuring Divisiveness of Proposals under Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the stated preferences of several people over a number of proposals regarding public policy initiatives, some of those proposals might be judged to be more ``divisive'' than others. When designing online participatory platforms to support digital democracy initiatives enabling citizens to deliberate over such proposals, we might wish to equip those platforms with the functionality to retrieve the most divisive proposals currently under discussion. Such a service would be useful for analysing the progress of deliberation and steering discussion towards issues that still require further debate. Guided by this use case, we explore possibilities for providing a clear definition of what it means to select a set of most divisive proposals on the basis of people's stated preferences over proposals. Then, employing the axiomatic method familiar from social choice theory, we show that the task of selecting the most divisive proposals in a manner that satisfies certain seemingly mild normative requirements faces a number of fundamental difficulties.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making for Energy Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic theory for Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in local energy sharing markets and analyze the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of the resulting economy with a Mean-Field Game. In this game, heterogeneous prosumers solve a Bellman equation to optimize energy consumption, storage, and exchanges. Our axioms identify a class of mechanisms with linear, Lipschitz continuous payment functions, where prices decrease with the aggregate supply-to-demand ratio of energy. We prove that implementing batch execution and concentrated liquidity allows standard design conditions from decentralized finance-quasi-concavity, monotonicity, and homotheticity-to construct AMMs that satisfy our axioms. The resulting AMMs are budget-balanced and achieve ex-ante efficiency, contrasting with the strategy-proof, expost optimal VCG mechanism. Since the AMM implements a Potential Game, we solve its equilibrium by first computing the social planner's optimum and then decentralizing the allocation. Numerical experiments using data from the Paris administrative region suggest that the prosumer community can achieve gains from trade up to 40% relative to the grid-only benchmark.</description>

      <title>BEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.</description>

      <title>The Oracle Complexity of Simplex-based Matrix Games: Linear Separability and Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$, where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity [Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983]) is not well-understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models which are implicitly used by prior algorithms, amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation between them. Specifically, we start by showing that algorithms for linear separability based on one-sided multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations, where $\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then prove that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations, establishing the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally, by adapting our lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations, which is an exponential improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji et al. [2024].</description>

      <title>Selfish, Local and Online Scheduling via Vector Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms and the competitive ratio of online algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.
  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of this technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \sum w_j C_j$. Moreover, this approach can analyze a simple local search algorithm for $R || \sum w_j C_j$, the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \sqrt{5})/4 + \varepsilon$ and an online greedy algorithm which is $4$-competitive.</description>

      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize single-item auction formats that are shill-proof in the sense that a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is non-positive. The Dutch auction (with a suitable reserve) is the unique (revenue-)optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Any deterministic auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof}. Our main results extend to settings with affiliated and interdependent values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the lattice operations for the (pairwise) stable set in many-to-many matching markets where only path-independence on agents' choice functions is imposed. To do this, we construct Tarski operators defined on the lattices of worker-quasi-stable and firm-quasi-stable matchings. These operators resemble lay-off and vacancy chain dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of state-based potential games for process optimization in decentralized manufacturing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel online transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach targets practical industrial scenarios where knowledge sharing among similar players enhances learning in large-scale and decentralized environments. TL-SbPGs enable players to reuse learned policies from others, which improves learning outcomes and accelerates convergence. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. The applicability of the SbPG framework to transfer learning is formally established. Furthermore, we present a method to optimize the timing and weighting of knowledge transfer. Experimental results from a laboratory-scale testbed show that TL-SbPGs improve production efficiency and reduce power consumption compared to vanilla SbPGs.</description>
