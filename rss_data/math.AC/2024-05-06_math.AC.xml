      <title>Infinite free resolutions over numerical semigroup algebras via specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$ corresponds to an integer point in a polyhedral cone $C_m$, known as the Kunz cone. The faces of $C_m$ form a stratification of numerical semigroups that has been shown to respect a number of algebraic properties of $S$, including the combinatorial structure of the minimal free resolution of the defining toric ideal $I_S$. In this work, we prove that the structure of the infinite free resolution of the ground field $\Bbbk$ over the semigroup algebra $\Bbbk[S]$ also respects this stratification, yielding a new combinatorial approach to classifying homological properties like Golodness and rationality of the poincare series in this setting. Additionally, we give a complete classification of such resolutions in the special case $m = 4$, and demonstrate that the associated graded algebras do not generally respect the same stratification.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>Gotzmann's persistence theorem for smooth projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gotzmann's persistence theorem enables us to confirm the Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme of projective space by checking the Hilbert function in just two points, regardless of the dimension of the ambient space. We generalise this result to products of projective spaces, and then extend our result to any smooth projective toric variety. In the case of products of projective spaces, the number of points depends solely on the Picard rank of the ambient space, rather than on the dimension. For a more general smooth projective toric variety this number depends on the number of Hilbert basis elements of the nef cone.</description>
