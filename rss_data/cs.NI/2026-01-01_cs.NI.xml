      <title>Improving Reliability of Human Trafficking Alerts in Airports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the latter scenario of individual emergency alerts in airports by applying two existing benchmark delay tolerant network protocols and evaluating their performance of delivery ratio and latency. First, the paper provides a background on Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), as well as Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) as a subset of MANETs. Next, the scenario is simulated using the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator and runs the DTN protocols applying Spray and Wait and Epidemic. The study discusses the results, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each protocol within the scenario and addressing constraints of the simulation or experimental setup. A wider discussion then considers related research on technologies that combat human trafficking and the potential role of DTN networks in improving this global issue for the better.</description>

      <title>Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM): Integrating Vision and Communication Modalities for 6G ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of multimodal foundation models has revolutionized learning paradigms by enabling joint understanding across diverse data types. In the context of next-generation wireless networks, integrating sensing and communication modalities presents a unique opportunity to develop generalizable and data-efficient models. In this work, we introduce the contrastive learning based Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM), a large-scale framework that jointly learns from wireless channel coefficients and visual imagery. The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification. Extensive experiments on the DeepVerse6G dataset demonstrate that the proposed WMFM achieves a 17% improvement in balanced accuracy for LoS/nLoS classification and a 48.5% reduction in localization error compared to the end-to-end (E2E) benchmark, while reducing training time by up to 90-fold. Even when trained with as little as 20% of the data, the WMFM-based heads outperform the fully supervised E2E model, underscoring their robustness and data-efficient learning. The proposed approach establishes a foundation for scalable, multimodal learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, paving the way for intelligent and adaptive 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Road Rules for Radio: Why Your Wi-Fi Got Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi allows for the connection of devices and people around the globe. It has proven to be a monumental and revolutionary tool that keeps the world connected. However, recent WiFi advancements are numerous and at times confusing. WiFi has grown significantly over the years, yet few understand the scope and scale of WiFi progression as a whole. This paper tackles that problem, providing a broad literature review on the advancements of key WiFi features to date. This paper will center on seven key areas of focus: (1) bandwidth, (2) battery life, (3) traffic collisions, (4) interference, (5) data-intensive transmissions, (6) numerous devices, and (7) peak throughput/modulation. Each section will focus on WiFi's problems, how those problems were fixed, as well as the limitations of existing solutions. Moreover, the paper explains the role of new unreleased technologies in these seven areas. This includes exploring the upcoming WiFi 8 standard based on the IEEE 802.11bn "Ultra High Reliability" (UHR) specification and how it builds upon current specifications. Compared to previous specifications, WiFi 8 marks a stronger and more significant shift toward prioritizing reliability over pure data rates. Beyond a sole literature review, this paper uses a novel analogy. A road/highway analogy will be integrated throughout the paper to facilitate understanding of networking mechanisms. This paper is approachable and is written such that someone with very little WiFi knowledge should come away with a strong understanding of WiFi. As is typical of literature review papers, technical claims will be grounded in prior work.</description>

      <title>SRM at 30: Lessons from Early Data-Centric Networking and Their Impact on Named Data Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1995 SIGCOMM paper, "A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application-Level Framing", commonly known as SRM, explored a fundamentally new approach to reliable multiparty data delivery. Rather than adapting established sender-driven reliable unicast mechanisms to multicast, as most contemporaneous proposals did, SRM introduced a data-centric model in which data receivers recover losses by explicitly requesting missing data. Thirty years later, we revisit the SRM framework, examining the challenges it faced, the lessons learned, and its influence on the later development of Named Data Networking (NDN). Experimentations with SRM revealed a fundamental semantic mismatch between its data-centric framework and IP's address-based delivery; while the application layer named data, the network layer remained 'blind' to those names, resulting in inefficient loss recovery. NDN resolves this architectural friction by aligning network delivery with the data-retrieval model and by securing data directly rather than securing communication channels. This retrospective highlights how early insights from SRM informed key design decisions in NDN and illustrates how NDN's design emerged from the cumulative insights gained over decades of networking research and development.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dedicated-Active: A General Reliability Provisioning Framework for SFC Placement in Fog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has strained traditional cloud infrastructures, highlighting the need for low-latency and energy-efficient alternatives. Fog computing addresses this by placing computation near the network edge. However, limited and heterogeneous fog resources pose reliability challenges, especially for mission-critical applications. On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints. The problem is formulated as an Integer Non-Linear Program (INLP), and two genetic algorithm (GA)-based solutions are developed. Simulation results show that shared-standby redundancy outperforms the conventional dedicated-active approach by up to 84%.</description>

      <title>CPePC: Cooperative and Predictive Popularity based Caching for Named Data Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caching content is an inherent feature of Named Data Networks. Limited cache capacity of routers warrants that the choice of content being cached is judiciously done. Existing techniques resort to caching popular content to maximize utilization. However, these methods experience significant overhead for coordinating and estimating the popularity of content. To address this issue, in this paper, we present CPePC, which is a cooperative caching technique designed to improve performance. It accomplishes this through a combination of two factors. First, CPePC enhances efficiency by minimizing the overhead of popularity estimation. Second, it forecasts a parameter that governs caching decisions. Efficiency in popularity estimation is achieved by dividing the network into several non-overlapping communities using a community estimation algorithm and selecting a leader node to coordinate this on behalf of all the nodes in the community. CPePC bases its caching decisions by predicting a parameter whose value is estimated using current cache occupancy and the popularity of the content into account. We present algorithms for community detection, leader selection, content popularity estimation, and caching decisions made by the CPePC method. We evaluate and compare it with six other state-of-the-art caching techniques, with simulations performed using a discrete event simulator to show that it outperforms others.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Semantic Communications via Multi-Task Learning and Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.</description>

      <title>Chat-Driven Optimal Management for Virtual Network Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Online Optimization Approach for IRS-enabled Low-altitude MEC in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled low-altitude multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture, where an aerial MEC server cooperates with a terrestrial MEC server to provide computing services, while hybrid IRSs (i.e., building-installed and UAV-carried IRSs) are deployed to enhance the air-ground connectivity under blockage. Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOOA achieves significant improvements, which reduces average task completion delay by 2.5% and average energy consumption by 3.1% compared with the best-performing benchmark approach and state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, respectively. Moreover, the proposed HOOA exhibits superior convergence stability while maintaining strong robustness and scalability in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Communication Predictability in LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication is essential in distributed training, with predictability being one of its most significant characteristics. However, existing studies primarily focus on exploiting predictability through online profiling for runtime optimization, without a systematic understanding of it. In this work, we aim to systematically formulate communication predictability in distributed training, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilize hybrid parallelism. Our analysis focuses on both traffic patterns and communication overhead. Specifically, we investigate predictable traffic patterns in typical LLMs and evaluate how various factors influence GPU utilization and effective bandwidth (two critical variables affecting communication overhead). Furthermore, we develop an analytical formulation to estimate communication overhead in LLM training, which is validated with high accuracy against empirical data. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a configuration tuning tool, ConfigTuner, to optimize training performance. Compared to Megatron-LM, the training configurations optimized by ConfigTuner demonstrate up to a 1.36$\times$ increase in throughput. Compared to Alpa, ConfigTuner generates the same configuration suggestion while significantly reducing the search complexity.</description>

      <title>Sidelink Positioning: Standardization Advancements, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of cellular networks in vertical industries that demand precise location information, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), public safety, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), positioning has become an imperative component for future wireless networks. By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning.</description>

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).</description>

      <title>Drift-Based Dataset Stability Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Resilient Collective Communication Library for LLM Training and Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol in Vehicular Opportunistic Networks: A Dynamic Cluster-based Routing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19026</link>

Abstract: Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) employ the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) paradigm to maintain communication during intermittent connectivity. However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network.</description>

      <title>Wireless Copilot: An AI-Powered Partner for Navigating Next-Generation Wireless Complexity</title>

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks introduces a level of operational complexity that exceeds the limits of traditional automation and manual oversight. This paper introduces the "Wireless Copilot", an AI-powered technical assistant designed to function as a collaborative partner for human network designers, engineers, and operators. We posit that by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with a robust cognitive framework. It will surpass the existing AI tools and interact with wireless devices, transmitting the user's intentions into the actual network execution process. Then, Wireless Copilot can translate high-level human intent into precise, optimized, and verifiable network actions. This framework bridges the gap between human expertise and machine-scale complexity, enabling more efficient, intelligent, and trustworthy management of 6G systems. Wireless Copilot will be a novel layer between the wireless infrastructure and the network operators. Moreover, we explore Wireless Copilot's methodology and analyze its application in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNets) assisting 6G networking, including network design, configuration, evaluation, and optimization. Additionally, we present a case study on intent-based LAWNets resource allocation, demonstrating its superior adaptability compared to others. Finally, we outline future research directions toward creating a comprehensive human-AI collaborative ecosystem for the 6G era.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Coordinate-Conditioned Diffusion Approach for 6G C-V2X Radio Environment Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmitter vehicles that broadcast 6G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)-based messages, e.g., Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), are prone to be impacted by PHY issues due to the lack of dynamic high-fidelity Radio Environment Map (REM) with dynamic location variation. This paper explores a lightweight diffusion-based generative approach, the Coordinate-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CCDDPM), that leverages the signal intensity-based 6G V2X Radio Environment Map (REM) from limited historical transmitter vehicles in a specific region, to predict the REMs for a transmitter vehicle with arbitrary coordinates across the same region. The transmitter vehicle coordinate is encoded as a smooth Gaussian prior and fused with the Gaussian noise through a lightweight two-channel conditional U-Net architecture. We demonstrate that the predicted REM closely matches the statistics and structure of ground-truth REM while exhibiting the improved stability and over other widely applied generative AI approaches. The resulting predictor enables rapid and scenario-consistent REM with arbitrary transmitter coordinates, which thereby supports more efficient 6G C-V2X communications where transmitter vehicles are less likely to suffer from the PHY issues.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Deep Learning-Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems on Resource-Limited Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.</description>
