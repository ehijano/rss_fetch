      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of Ruin of an Insurance Company in Ghana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An insurance company, as a risk bearer, is exposed to the likelihood of running into ruin. This is the situation where the initial surplus falls below zero. There is the need to find the required start-up capital to hedge against insolvency. Most researchers, irrespective of whether the test for claim dependency holds or not, assume claim independence in their computing of ruin probabilities to start up their initial capital. The objective of this study is to carry out comparative sensitivity analysis of ruin probability under both assumptions of dependence and independence, irrespective of whether the data exhibits independence or not, based on data from an insurance company in Ghana. Secondary data from an insurance company was obtained from the National Insurance Commission (NIC) for the period of 2013 to 2017. The study employed copulas to determine the claim dependence among the various insurance products and the company in general. The study concluded that when there is dependence in the claim data, computing the ruin probability based on the assumption of independence results in underestimation. Among the various insurance products, the most profitable insurance product was motor insurance, and Fire and Allied insurance exhibited the highest dependency. At a higher start-up capital, when claims are dependent, assuming independence in calculating the ruin probability results in a significant difference. Hence, it was recommended that insurance companies should adopt the assumption of dependence between the claims data as the initial reserves become larger, particularly for larger insurance companies, to avoid misleading results. Also, awareness of the perils and consequences of fire outbreaks and disasters should be raised to the general public to reduce the risk of frequent occurrence.</description>

      <title>On the valuation of life insurance policies for dependent coupled lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a complex variation of the standard joint life annuity policy by introducing three distinct contingent benefits for the surviving member(s) of a couple, along with a contingent benefit for their beneficiaries if both members pass away. Our objective is to price this innovative insurance policy and analyse its sensitivity to key model parameters, particularly those related to the joint mortality framework. We employ the $QP$-rule (described in Section \ref{secgenset}), which combines the real-world probability measure $P$ for mortality risk with risk-neutral valuation under $Q$ for financial market risks. The model enables explicit pricing expressions, computed using efficient numerical methods. Our results highlight the interdependent risks faced by couples, such as broken-heart syndrome, providing valuable insights for insurers and policyholders regarding the pricing influences of these factors.</description>
