      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Optimal control applied to viral competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of mutant lineages within a viral species has become a public health problem, as the existing treatments and drugs are usually more effective on the original lineages than in the mutant ones. The following manuscript presents mathematical models that describe the emergence of these lineages. In order to reduce the damage and possible casualties that can be attributed to these more contagious microorganisms, the theory of optimal control is introduced and a more sophisticated model is proposed to reduce the mutant growth compared to the original one. The analytical study of these models allows us to obtain an overview of the expected behavior over time, which is validated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D+1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Why a System of Three Bosons on Separate Lines Can Not Exhibit the Confinement Induced Efimov Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of three bosons interacting with short-range potentials which can move along three different lines. Two of these lines are parallel to each other within one plane. The third line is constrained to a plane perpendicular to the first one. Recently it was predicted in physics literature that such a system exhibits the so-called confinement induced Efimov effect. We prove that this prediction is not correct by showing that this system has at most finitely many bound-states.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the Diagonal Entries of the Resolvent of a Complex Ginibre Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of eigenvalue distributions in random matrix theory is often conducted by analyzing the resolvent matrix $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) = (z \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} $. The normalized trace of the resolvent, known as the Stieltjes transform $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, converges to a limit $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}(z) $ as the matrix dimension $ N $ grows, which provides the eigenvalue density $ \rho_{\mathbf{M}} $ in the large-$ N $ limit. In the Hermitian case, the distribution of $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, now regarded as a random variable, is explicitly known when $ z $ lies within the limiting spectrum, and it coincides with the distribution of any diagonal entry of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $.
  In this paper, we investigate what becomes of these results when $ \mathbf{M} $ is non-Hermitian. Our main result is the exact computation of the diagonal elements of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $ when $ \mathbf{M} $ is a Ginibre matrix of size $ N $, as well as the high-dimensional limit for different regimes of $ z $, revealing a tail behavior connected to the statistics of the left and right eigenvectors. Interestingly, the limit distribution is stable under inversion, a property previously observed in the symmetric case. We then propose two general conjectures regarding the distribution of the diagonal elements of the resolvent and its normalized trace in the non-Hermitian case, both of which reveal a symmetry under inversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral decomposition with respect to the wave functions of Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system defines an integral transform, which generalizes classical Fourier integral. For a certain class of analytical symmetric functions we prove inversion formula and orthogonality relations, valid for complex valued parameters of the system. Besides, we study four regimes of unitarity, when this transform defines isomorphisms of the corresponding $L_2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability and geometry: a review of the extended Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the results of several of our papers about the procedure of extension of Hamiltonians, allowing the construction of families of superintegrable systems with non-trivial polynomial first integrals (or symmetry operators) of arbitrarily high degree. In particular, we focus on the geometric structures involved by the procedure: warped manifolds and Riemannian coverings. Examples of superintegrable systems, classical and quantum, with the structure of extended Hamiltonians are anisotropic harmonic oscillators, Kepler-Coulomb, Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz and Post-Winternitz systems.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

      <title>A Limit Theorem Clarifying the Physical Origin of Fractional Brownian Motion and Related Gaussian Models of Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamical system describing the motion of a test-particle surrounded by $N$ Brownian particles with different masses. Physical principles of conservation of momentum and energy are met. We prove that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general (non-Markovian) Gaussian process whose covariance function is determined by the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles. In particular, with proper choices of the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles, we obtain fractional Brownian motion, a mixture of independent fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst parameters and the classical Wiener process. Moreover, we present some distributions of masses of the surround-particles leading to limiting processes which perform transition from ballistic to superdiffusion or from ballistic to classical diffusion.

      <title>Conditional symmetries and conditional constants of motion for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional symmetries were introduced by Levi and Winternitz in their 1989 seminal paper to deal with nonlinear PDEs. Here we discuss their application in the framework of ODEs, and more specifically Dynamical Systems; it turns out they are closely related to two established -- albeit maybe less widely known -- concepts, i.e. orbital symmetries and configurational invariants. The paper is devoted to studying the interplay of these notions, and their application in the study of Dynamical Systems, with special attention to invariant manifolds of these.</description>

      <title>Stokes Waves in Finite Depth Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider traveling waves on a surface of an ideal fluid of finite depth. The equation describing Stokes waves in conformal variables formulation are referred to as the Babenko equation. We use a Newton-Conjugate-Gradient method to compute Stokes waves for a range of conformal depths from deep to shallow water. In deep water, we compute eigenvalues of the linearized Babenko equation with Fourier-Floquet-Hill method. The secondary bifurcation points that correspond to double period bifurcations of the Stokes waves are identified on the family of waves. In shallow water, we find solutions that have broad troughs and sharp crests, and which resemble cnoidal or soliton-like solution profiles of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Regardless of depth, we find that these solutions form a $2\pi/3$ angle at the crest in the limit of large steepness.</description>

      <title>Deformed algebraic structure of angular momenta: GUP perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of a minimal length scale by various quantum gravity candidates (such as string/M theory, Doubly Special Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and others) have suggested modification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), resulting in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP).
  In this short review, we investigate the origins of the GUP and examine higher-order models, focusing on the linear plus quadratic form of the GUP. We extend the concept of minimal length to minimal angular resolution, which plays a crucial role in modifying angular momentum and its associated algebra. A comparison is made between the standard angular momentum commutator algebra and that modified by the GUP. Finally, we review its application in the hydrogen atom spectra and and discuss future endeavors.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions $2$ and $3$ by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lorentz surfaces and s-embeddings II: maximal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S-embeddings were introduced by Chelkak as a tool to study the conformal invariance of the thermodynamic limit of the Ising model. Moreover, Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh introduced a lift of s-embeddings to Lorentz space, and showed that in the limit the lift converges to a maximal surface. They posed the question whether there are s-embeddings that lift to maximal surfaces already at the discrete level, before taking the limit. We answer this question in the positive. In a previous paper we identified a subclass of s-embeddings--isothermic s-embeddings--that lift to (discrete) S-isothermic surfaces, which were introduced by Bobenko and Pinkall as a discretization of isothermic surfaces. In this paper we identify a special class of isothermic s-embeddings that correspond to discrete S-maximal surfaces, translating an approach of Bobenko, Hoffmann and Springborn introduced for discrete S-minimal surfaces in Euclidean space. Additionally, each S-maximal surface comes with a 1-parameter family of associated surfaces that are isometric. This enables us to obtain an associated family of s-embeddings for each maximal s-embedding. We show that the Ising weights are constant in the associated family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of scalar products between two vectors is a common task in scientific computing and, by extension, in quantum computing. In this work, we introduce two alternative quantum circuits for computing scalar products with phase information, combining the structure of the swap test, the vacuum test, and the Hadamard test. These novel frameworks, called the zero-control and one-control tests, present different trade-offs between circuit depth and qubit count for accessing the scalar product between two quantum states. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the gate count for large numbers of qubits and decreases the scaling of quantum requirements compared to the Hadamard test.</description>

      <title>Celestial decomposition of Wigner's particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed decomposition of Wigner's particles, defined as unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group, in terms of unitary representations of its Lorentz subgroup. As pointed out before us, this decomposition only involves Lorentz representations belonging to the principal continuous series, and further underpins the connection between scattering amplitudes and conformal correlation functions discussed in the context of celestial holography. We provide very explicit formulae for the decomposition of particles of arbitrary mass and (half-)integer spin and for any spacetime dimension. We emphasise that this decomposition is unique and comes with a specific inner product on the corresponding Hilbert space. We also confirm that unitary translations mix Lorentz representations within the principal continuous series only, as required. Implications to the celestial holography program are indicated.</description>

      <title>Parametric Lattices Are Better Quantizers in Dimensions 13 and 14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New lattice quantizers with lower normalized second moments than previously reported are constructed in 13 and 14 dimensions and conjectured to be optimal. Our construction combines an initial numerical optimization with a subsequent analytical optimization of families of lattices, whose Voronoi regions are constructed exactly. The new lattices are constructed from glued products of previously known lattices, by scaling the component lattices and then optimizing the scale factors. A two-parameter family of lattices in 13 dimensions reveals an intricate landscape of phase changes as the parameters are varied.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff's analogy for a planar ferromagnetic rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the equilibrium solutions of an elastic rod or strip to the motion of a spinning top. In this analogy, time is replaced by the arc length parameter in the phase portrait to determine the equilibrium configurations of the rod. Predicted equilibrium solutions from the phase portrait for specific boundary value problems, as well as certain localized solutions, have been experimentally observed. In this study, we employ the kinetic analogy to investigate the equilibrium solutions of planar soft ferromagnetic rods subjected to transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in the phase portrait of a ferromagnetic rod subjected to transverse external magnetic field as the axial load is decreased continuously from a large compressive load. Similarly, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed in the case of longitudinal external magnetic field. We predict equilibrium configurations for a free-standing soft ferromagnetic elastic rod and the same subjected to canonical boundary conditions. Furthermore, we observe novel localized equilibrium solutions arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which are absent in the phase portraits of purely elastic rods.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the investigation of the solvability of an integro-differential equation in the case of the double scale anomalous diffusion with a sum of two negative Laplacians in different fractional powers in R^3. The proof of the existence of solutions relies on a fixed point technique. Solvability conditions for the elliptic operators without the Fredholm property in unbounded domains are used.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the Painlev\'e property to fractional differential equations (FDEs) are extended and the existence and uniqueness theorems for both linear and nonlinear FDEs are established. The results contribute to the research of integrability and solvability in the context of fractional calculus, which has significant implications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and applied sciences. By bridging the gap between pure mathematical theory and practical applications, this work provides a foundational understanding that can be utilized in modeling phenomena exhibiting memory and hereditary properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the marginal beta deformation of the ${N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory manifests within the context of the topological B-model in the twistor space $\mathbb{CP}^{3|4}$. We begin by identifying the beta deformation as states living in a specific irreducible representation of the superconformal algebra. Then, we compute the ghost number two elements of the BRST cohomology of the topological model. A gauge-fixing procedure is applied to these states, allowing us to identify the elements living in the irreducible representation that characterizes the beta deformation. Based on this identification, we proceed to write the deformed topological action, and the corresponding deformed BRST operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently shown that the space of initial data (covariant phase space) of the relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$=AdS$_7$/U(1)=U(3,1)/U(3)$\times$U(1). It was also shown that the energy eigenstates of the quantum relativistic oscillator form a direct sum of two weighted Bergman spaces of holomorphic (particles) and antiholomorphic (antiparticles) square-integrable functions on the covariant phase space $Z_6$ of the classical oscillator. Here we show that the covariant phase space of the supersymmetric version of the relativistic oscillator (oscillating spinning particle) is the odd tangent bundle of the space $Z_6$. Quantizing this model yields a Dirac oscillator equation on the phase space whose solution space is a direct sum of two spinor spaces parametrized by holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions on the odd tangent bundle of $Z_6$. After expanding the general solution in Grassmann variables, we obtain components of the spinor field that are holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions from Bergman spaces on $Z_6$ with different weight functions. Thus, the supersymmetric model under consideration is exactly solvable, Lorentz covariant and unitary.</description>

      <title>A strategy to control synchronized dynamics in swarmalator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization forms the basis of many coordination phenomena in natural systems, enabling them to function cohesively and support their fundamental operations. However, there are scenarios where synchronization disrupts a system's proper functioning, necessitating mechanisms to control or suppress it. While several methods exist for controlling synchronization in non-spatially embedded oscillators, to the best of our knowledge no such strategies have been developed for swarmalators (oscillators that simultaneously move in space and synchronize in time). In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel control strategy based on Hamiltonian control theory to suppress synchronization in a system of swarmalators confined to a one-dimensional space. The numerical investigations we performed, demonstrate that the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamics within the swarmalator population. We studied the impact of the number of controlled swarmalators as well as the strength of the control term, in its original form and in a simplified one.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics. Discrete and continuous symmetries are considered in different approaches. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with spectrality and a few further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a geometrical interpretation of the confluent Heun functions (CHE) within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and elaborates on their relation to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of confluent Heun functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key geometrical surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future time infinity. We also discuss the relation between CHEs and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Even though neither representation of the radial Teukolsky equation in the confluent Heun form can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this geometrical approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

Abstract: A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced. This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the microscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality states that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether a pair of states remains distinguishable after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of quantum channels. We show that many quantum channels do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. Furthermore, we propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for various pairs of quantum channels, including depolarizing, generalized dephasing, and amplitude damping channels, allowing us to establish a reverse-type data processing inequality for several settings. As an application, we construct a class of less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable. This work contributes new mathematical tools for evaluating quantum information preservation across channels.</description>

Abstract: We study the collapse of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate, where an unstable system evolves towards a singularity, by numerically solving the underlying cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find good agreement between our simulations and the atom-loss measurements with a $^{39}$K condensate. Our simulations reveal an interplay of weak collapse and the propensity of the system to form a hotspot, and we uncover new scaling laws that govern this behavior. We also identify promising signatures of the theoretically predicted, but so far experimentally elusive, elastic three-body interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.07908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze continuous partial differential models of topological insulators in the form of systems of Dirac equations. We describe the bulk and interface topological properties of the materials by means of indices of Fredholm operators constructed from the Dirac operators by spectral calculus. We show the stability of these topological invariants with respect to perturbations by a large class of spatial heterogeneities. These models offer a quantitative tool to analyze the interplay between topology and spatial fluctuations in topological phases of matter. The theory is first presented for two-dimensional materials, which display asymmetric (chiral) transport along interfaces. It is then generalized to arbitrary dimensions with the additional assumption of chiral symmetry in odd spatial dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When employing Feynman path integrals to compute propagators in quantum physics, the concept of summing over the set of all paths is not always naive. In fact, an auxiliary phase often has to be included as a weight for each summand. In this article we discuss the nature of those phase factors for the various types of boundary conditions including all three of the Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin types, as well as their mixtures. We verify that for a free particle confined on a line segment, the resulting formula on the propagator matches those arising from the Schrodinger equation, with a trivial normalization factor.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Operator-valued Elliptic Flows with Application to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations on spaces of operators are very little developed in Mathematics, being in general very challenging. Here, we study a novel system of such (non-linear) differential equations. We show it has a unique solution for all times, for instance in the operator or Hilbert-Schmidt norm topologies. This system presents remarkable ellipticity properties that turn out to be crucial for the study of the infinite-time limit of its solution, which is proven under relatively weak, albeit probably not necessary, hypotheses on the initial data. This system of differential equations is the elliptic counterpart of an hyperbolic flow applied to quantum field theory to diagonalize Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the bosonic field. In a similar way, this elliptic flow, in particular its asymptotics, has application in quantum field theory: it can be used to diagonalize Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the fermionic field while giving new explicit expressions and properties of these pivotal Hamiltonians of quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Hamiltonians in Fermionic Fock Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Hamiltonians are important in quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics. Their general studies, which go back to the sixties, are relatively incomplete for the fermionic case studied here. Following Berezin, they are quadratic in the fermionic field and in this way well-defined self-adjoint operators acting on the fermionic Fock space. We analyze their diagonalization by applying a novel elliptic operator-valued differential equations studied in a companion paper. This allows for their ($\mathrm{N}$-) diagonalization under much weaker assumptions than before. Last but not least, in 1994 Bach, Lieb and Solovej defined them to be generators of strongly continuous unitary groups of Bogoliubov transformations. This is shown to be an equivalent definition, as soon as the vacuum state belongs to the domain of definition of these Hamiltonians. This second outcome is demonstrated to be reminiscent to the celebrated Shale-Stinespring condition on Bogoliubov transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the determination of Hamiltonian from a given equations of motion. It can be cast into a problem of matrix factorization after reinterpretation of the system as first-order evolutionary equations in the phase space coordinates. We state the criterion on the evolution matrix for a Hamiltonian to exist. In addition, the proof is constructive and an explicit Hamiltonian with accompanied symplectic structure can be obtained. As an application, we will study a few classes of dynamical systems for illustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the contact structures and contact dynamics of stochastic vector bundles. It finds that the probability space of stochastic vector bundles possesses an infinite-order jet structure, enabling a geometrical analysis of stochastic processes. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that stochastic vector bundles have a natural contact structure, leading to a decomposition of the tangent space and providing insights into the system's evolution and constraints. Finally, it derives a set of canonical equations for stochastic vector bundles. These equations are also the result of the principle of least constraint, showing the relation between the geometric structure of stochastic system evolution and its tendency to minimize energy exchange. This study provides a valuable geometric framework for analyzing stochastic systems, with potential applications in various fields where probabilistic behavior is crucial.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Zeno effect with higher order convergence rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To implement the dynamics of a projected Hamiltonian or Lindbladian, the quantum Zeno effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that approximates the effective dynamic by intersecting the Hamiltonian or Lindblad evolution by any quantum operation that converges to the desired projected subspace. Unlike the related Trotter product formula, the best-known convergence rate of the quantum Zeno effect is limited to the order $1/n$. In this work, we improve the convergence rate using a multi-product formula to achieve any power of $1/n^{K+1}$, employing a modified Chernoff Lemma, a modified Dunford-Segal approximation, and the holomorphic functional calculus. We briefly illustrate this scheme using the bosonic cat code as an example, along with a broader class of cases governed by the `Bang-Bang' method for decoupling systems from their environment.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film where electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being $300$ times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external electric fields, such as those induced by local defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bopp shifts, introduced in 1956, played a pivotal role in the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. As demonstrated in our previous work, Bopp's construction provides a phase-space perspective of quantum mechanics that is closely connected to the Moyal star product and its role in deformation quantization. In this paper, we both review and expand on our exploration of Bopp quantization, emphasizing its relationship with the Moyal product and its applications in elementary deformation quantization. Notably, we apply these constructions to the density operator, which represents mixed states in quantum mechanics, offering novel insights into its role within this framework.</description>

      <title>Can multipartite entanglement be characterized by two-point connected correlation functions ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss under which conditions multipartite entanglement in mixed quantum states can be characterized only in terms of two-point connected correlation functions, as it is the case for pure states. In turn, the latter correlations are defined via a suitable combination of (disconnected) one- and two-point correlation functions. In contrast to the case of pure states, conditions to be satisfied turn out to be rather severe. However, we were able to identify some interesting cases, as when the point-independence is valid of the one-point correlations in each possible decomposition of the density matrix, or when the operators that enter in the correlations are (semi-)positive/negative defined.</description>

      <title>Exceptional algebroids and type IIA superstrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exceptional algebroids in the context of warped compactifications of type IIA string theory down to $n$ dimensions, with $n\le 6$. In contrast to the M-theory and type IIB case, the relevant algebroids are no longer exact, and their locali moduli space is no longer trivial, but has $5$ distinct points. This relates to two possible scalar deformations of the IIA theory. The proof of the local classification shows that, in addition to these scalar deformations, one can twist the bracket using a pair of $1$-forms, a $2$-form, a $3$-form, and a $4$-form. Furthermore, we use the analysis to translate the classification of Leibniz parallelisable spaces (corresponding to maximally supersymmetric consistent truncations) into a tractable algebraic problem. We finish with a discussion of the Poisson-Lie U-duality and examples given by tori and spheres in $2$, $3$, and $4$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of Y-algebroids, generalising the Lie, Courant, and exceptional algebroids that have been used to capture the local symmetry structure of type II string theory and M-theory compactifications to $D \geq 5$ dimensions. Instead of an invariant inner product, or its generalisation arising in exceptional algebroids, Y-algebroids are built around a specific type of tensor, denoted $Y$, that provides exactly the necessary properties to also describe compactifications to $D=4$ dimensions. We classify "M-exact" $E_7$-algebroids and show that this precisely matches the form of the generalised tangent space of $E_{7(7)} \times \mathbb{R}^+$-generalised geometry, with possible twists due to 1-, 4- and 7-form fluxes, corresponding physically to the derivative of the warp factor and the M-theory fluxes. We translate the notion of generalised Leibniz parallelisable spaces, relevant to consistent truncations, into this language, where they are mapped to so-called exceptional Manin pairs. We also show how to understand Poisson-Lie U-duality and exceptional complex structures using Y-algebroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disk together with an independent conformal loop ensemble (CLE) with parameter $\kappa=4$. We show that the critical LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent critical LQG disks given the LQG lengths of the loops. We also show that the joint law of the LQG lengths of the loops is described in terms of the jumps of a certain $3/2$-stable process. Our proofs are via a limiting argument based on the analogous statements for $\gamma \in (\sqrt{8/3},2)$ and $\kappa = \gamma^2 \in (8/3,4)$ which were proven by Miller, Sheffield, and Werner (2020). Our results are used in the construction of a coupling of supercritical LQG with CLE$_4$ in another paper by the same authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>New Algebraic Fast Algorithms for $N$-body Problems in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two new algebraic multilevel hierarchical matrix algorithms to perform fast matrix-vector product (MVP) for $N$-body problems in $d$ dimensions, namely efficient $\mathcal{H}^2_{*}$ (fully nested algorithm, i.e., $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix-like algorithm) and $(\mathcal{H}^2 + \mathcal{H})_{*}$ (semi-nested algorithm, i.e., cross of $\mathcal{H}^2$ and $\mathcal{H}$ matrix-like algorithms). The efficient $\mathcal{H}^2_{*}$ and $(\mathcal{H}^2 + \mathcal{H})_{*}$ hierarchical representations are based on our recently introduced weak admissibility condition in higher dimensions, where the admissible clusters are the far-field and the vertex-sharing clusters. Due to the use of nested form of the bases, the proposed hierarchical matrix algorithms are more efficient than the non-nested algorithms ($\mathcal{H}$ matrix algorithms). We rely on purely algebraic low-rank approximation techniques (e.g., ACA and NCA) and develop both algorithms in a black-box fashion. Another noteworthy contribution of this article is that we perform a comparative study of the proposed algorithms with different algebraic (NCA or ACA-based compression) fast MVP algorithms in $2$D and $3$D. The fast algorithms are tested on various kernel matrices and applied to get fast iterative solutions of a dense linear system arising from the discretized integral equations and radial basis function interpolation. Notably, all the algorithms are developed in a similar fashion in $\texttt{C++}$ and tested within the same environment, allowing for meaningful comparisons. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are competitive to the NCA-based standard $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix algorithm with respect to the memory and time. The C++ implementation of the proposed algorithms is available at https://github.com/riteshkhan/H2weak/.</description>

      <title>Convergence of bipartite open quantum systems stabilized by reservoir engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generic family of Lindblad master equations modeling bipartite open quantum systems, where one tries to stabilize a quantum system by carefully designing its interaction with another, dissipative, quantum system-a strategy known as quantum reservoir engineering. We provide sufficient conditions for convergence of the considered Lindblad equations; our setting accommodates the case where steady-states are not unique but rather supported on a given subspace of the underlying Hilbert space. We apply our result to a Lindblad master equation modeling engineered multi-photon emission and absorption processes, a setting that received considerable attention in recent years due to its potential applications for the stabilization of so-called cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Projective toric designs, quantum state designs, and mutually unbiased bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toric $t$-designs, or equivalently $t$-designs on the diagonal subgroup of the unitary group, are sets of points on the torus over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full torus. Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs on the projective torus, which have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various new constructions of toric and projective toric designs and prove bounds on their size. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs. In particular, we construct families of (uniformly-weighted) quantum state $2$-designs in dimension $d$ of size exactly $d(d+1)$ that do not form complete sets of MUBs, thereby disproving a conjecture concerning the relationship between designs and MUBs (Zhu 2015). We then propose a modification of Zhu's conjecture and discuss potential paths towards proving this conjecture. We prove a fundamental distinction between complete sets of MUBs in prime-power dimensions versus in dimension $6$ (and, we conjecture, in all non-prime-power dimensions), the distinction relating to group structure of the corresponding projective toric design. Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number theory, geometry, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Variational Loop Vertex Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop Vertex Expansion (LVE) was developed to construct QFT models with local and non-local interactions. Using LVE, one can prove the analyticity in the finite cardioid-like domain in the complex plain of the coupling constant of the free energies and cumulants of various vector, matrix, or tensor-type models. Here, applying the idea of choosing the initial approximation depending on the coupling constant, we construct the analytic continuation of the free energy of the quartic matrix model beyond the standard LVE cardioid over the branch cut and for arbitrary large couplings.</description>

      <title>Electroweak parameters from mixed SU(2) Yang-Mills Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the thermal phase structure of pure SU(2) quantum Yang-Mills theory, we describe the electron at rest as an extended particle, a droplet of radius $r_0\sim a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. This droplet is of vanishing pressure and traps a monopole within its bulk at a temperature of $T_c=7.95$ keV. The monopole is the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. It is interpreted in an electric-magnetically dual way. Utilizing a spherical mirror-charge construction, we approximate the droplet's charge at a value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha^{-1}\sim 134$ for soft external probes. It is shown that the droplet does not exhibit an electric dipole or quadrupole moment due to averages of its far-field electric potential over monopole positions. We also calculate the mixing angle $\theta_{\rm W}\sim 30^{\circ}$ which belongs to deconfining phases of two SU(2) gauge theories of very distinct Yang-Mills scales ($\Lambda_{\rm e}=3.6\,$keV and $\Lambda_{\rm CMB}\sim 10^{-4}\,$eV). Here, the condition that the droplet's bulk thermodynamics is stable determines the value of $\theta_W$. The core radius of the monopole, whose inverse equals the droplet's mass in natural units, is about 1% of $r_0$.</description>

      <title>Loop soup representation of zeta-regularised determinants and equivariant Symanzik identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic representation for determinants of Laplace-type operators on vectors bundles over manifolds. Namely, inverse powers of those determinants are written as the expectation of a product of holonomies defined over Brownian loop soups. Our results hold over compact manifolds of dimension 2 or 3, in the presence of a mass or a boundary. We derive a few consequences, including some continuity of these determinants as a function of the operator, and the conformal invariance of the determinant on surfaces.
  This expression allows us to construct the scalar field minimally coupled to a prescribed random smooth gauge field, which we prove obeys the so-called Symanzik identities. Some of these results are continuous analogues of the work of A. Kassel and T. L\'evy in the discrete.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem as a geometric probabilistic approach to filtration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane distributed with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature, such as the efficiency of a filter and the emergence of clogging in filtration process. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$ and its analytical difficulty in a general sense. Here, rather than a `short' needle embedded in two-dimensional space, we analytically solve problem versions with needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius embedded in two- and three-dimensional spaces dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to provide a geometric analytical perspective to filtration process, and also extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $PSU(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the group $PSU(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT that exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$ and has a global $PSU(n)$ symmetry. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $PSU(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of two modes coupled through a dissipative movable mirror in an optomechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonclassical states are an important class of states in quantum mechanics, particularly for applications in quantum information theory. Optomechanical systems are invaluable platforms for exploring and harnessing these states. In this study, we focus on a mirror-in-the-middle optomechanical system. In the absence of losses, a separable state, composed of the product of coherent states, evolves into an entangled state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that generating a two-mode Schr\"odinger-cat state depends on the optomechanical coupling. Additionally, when the optical modes are uncoupled from the mechanical mode, we find no entanglement for certain nonzero optomechanical coupling intensities. We exactly solve the Gorini-Kossalokowinki-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, highlighting the direct influence of the reservoir on the dynamics when mechanical losses are considered. Then, we discuss vacuum one-photon superposition states to obtain exact entanglement dynamics using concurrence as a quantifier. Our results show that mechanical losses in the mirror attenuate the overall entanglement of the system.</description>

Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>

Abstract: This article reflects on the life and mathematical contributions of Pierre Cartier, a distinguished figure in 20th- and 21st-century mathematics. As a key member of the Bourbaki collective, Cartier played a pivotal role in the formalization and modernization of mathematics. His work spanned fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, and category theory, leaving an indelible mark on the discipline. Beyond his technical achievements, Cartier was celebrated for his intellectual generosity and humanistic approach to science, shaping not only mathematical thought but also the broader cultural understanding of the field.</description>

      <title>From classical probability densities to quantum states: quantization of Gaussians for arbitrary orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this work is to investigate how the most emblematic classical probability density, namely a Gaussian, can be mapped to a valid quantum states. To explore this issue, we consider a Gaussian whose squared variance depends on a parameter $\lambda$. Specifically, depending on the value of $\lambda$, we study what happens in the classical-quantum correspondence as we change the indeterminacy of the classical particle. Furthermore, finding a correspondence between a classical state and a quantum state is not a trivial task. Quantum observables, described by Hermitian operators, do not generally commute, so a precise ordering must be introduced to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we study two different arbitrary orderings: the first is an arbitrary ordering of the position and momentum observables; the second, which is the main focus of the present work, is an arbitrary ordering of the annihilation and creation operators. In this latter case, we find the interesting result that even a $\delta$-function, which in general has no quantum correspondence, can be mapped into a valid quantum state for a particular ordering, specifically the antinormal one (all creation operators are to the right of all annihilation operators in the product). This means that the Gaussian probability density corresponds to a valid quantum state, regardless of how localized classical particles are in phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a large system of $N$ Brownian motions in $\R ^d$ fixed on a time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrized initial and terminal conditions, under the influence of a trap potential. Such systems describe systems of bosons at positive temperatures confined in a spatial domain. We describe the large $N$ behavior of the averaged path (that is, their empirical path measure) and its connection with a well known optimal transport problem formulated by Erwin Schr\"odinger. We also explore the asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motions in terms of Large Deviations. In particular, the rate function that governs the mean of occupation measures turns out to be the well-known Donsker-Varadhan rate function. We therefore prove a simple formula for the large $N$ asymptotic of the symmetrized trace of $e^{-\beta \Hcal_N}$, where $\Hcal_N$ is an $N$ particle Hamilton operator in a trap</description>
