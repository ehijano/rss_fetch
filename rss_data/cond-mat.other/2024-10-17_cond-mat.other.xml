      <title>Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>

      <title>Influence of different mutual friction models on two-way coupled quantized vortices and normal fluid in superfluid $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of two mutual friction models on quantized vortices and normal fluid using two-way coupled simulations of superfluid $^4$He. The normal fluid is affected by quantized vortices via mutual friction. A previous study [Y. Tang, et al. Nat. Commun. 14, 2941 (2023)] compared the time evolutions of the vortex ring radius and determined that the self-consistent two-way coupled mutual friction (S2W) model yielded better agreement with the experimental results than the two-way coupled mutual friction (2W) model whose model parameters were determined through experiments with rotating superfluid helium. In this study, we compare the two models in more detail in terms of the quantized vortex ring propagation, reconnection, and thermal counterflow. We show that the S2W model exhibits better results than the 2W model on the microscopic scale near a quantized vortex, such as during quantized vortex ring propagation and reconnection, although the S2W model requires a higher spatial resolution. For complex flows such as a thermal counterflow, the 2W model can be applied even to a low-resolution flow while maintaining the anisotropic normal fluid velocity fluctuations. In contrast, the 2W model predicts lower normal fluid velocity fluctuations than the S2W model. The two models show probability density functions with $- 3$ power-law tails for the normal fluid velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Programmable adiabatic demagnetization for systems with trivial and topological excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17256v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple, robust protocol to prepare a low-energy state of an arbitrary Hamiltonian on a quantum computer or programmable quantum simulator. The protocol is inspired by the adiabatic demagnetization technique, used to cool solid-state systems to extremely low temperatures. A fraction of the qubits (or spins) is used to model a spin bath that is coupled to the system. By an adiabatic ramp down of a simulated Zeeman field acting on the bath spins, energy and entropy are extracted from the system. The bath spins are then measured and reset to the polarized state, and the process is repeated until convergence to a low-energy steady state is achieved. We demonstrate the protocol via application to the quantum Ising model. We study the protocol's performance in the presence of noise and show how the information from the measurement of the bath spins can be used to monitor the cooling process. The performance of the algorithm depends on the nature of the excitations of the system; systems with non-local (topological) excitations are more difficult to cool than those with local excitations. We explore the possible mitigation of this problem by trapping topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Exchange-enhanced spin-orbit splitting and its density dependence for electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by electron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement of the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in particular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier sheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of filling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also separates the regimes of slow (at $n&lt;n_*$) and fast (for $n&gt;n_*$) spin and valley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is determined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange renormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.</description>
