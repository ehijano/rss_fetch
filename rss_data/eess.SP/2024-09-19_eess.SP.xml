      <title>Ambient IoT: Communications Enabling Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most intriguing 6G vertical markets is precision agriculture, where communications, sensing, control, and robotics technologies are used to improve agricultural outputs and decrease environmental impact. Ambient IoT (A-IoT), which uses a network of devices that harvest ambient energy to enable communications, is expected to play an important role in agricultural use cases due to its low costs, simplicity, and battery-free (or battery-assisted) operation. In this paper, we review the use cases of precision agriculture and discuss the challenges. We discuss how A-IoT can be used for precision agriculture and compare it with other ambient energy source technologies. We also discuss research directions related to both A-IoT and precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>XRL: An FMM-Accelerated SIE Simulator for Resistance and Inductance Extraction of Complicated 3-D Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast multipole method (FMM)-accelerated surface integral equation (SIE) simulator, called XRL, is proposed for broadband resistance/inductance (RL) extraction under the magneto-quasi-static assumption. The proposed XRL has three key attributes that make it highly efficient and accurate for broadband RL extraction of complicated 3-D geometries: (i) The XRL leverages a novel centroid-midpoint basis transformation while discretizing surface currents, which allows converting edge-based vector potential computations to panel-based scalar potential computations. Such conversion makes the implementation of FMM straightforward and allows for drastically reducing the memory and computational time requirements of the simulator. (ii) The XRL employs a highly accurate equivalent surface impedance model that allows extracting RL parameters at low frequencies very accurately. (iii) The XRL makes use of a novel preconditioner, effectively including both diagonal entries and some near-field entries of the system matrix; such preconditioner significantly accelerates the iterative solution of SIE. The proposed XRL can accurately compute broadband RL parameters of arbitrarily shaped and large-scale structures on a desktop computer. It has been applied to RL parameter extraction of various practical structures, including two parallel square coils, a ball grid array (BGA) package and a high brand package on package. Its application to the parameter extraction of the BGA shows that the XRL requires 93.2x and 14.2x less computational time and memory resources compared to the commercial simulator Ansys Q3D for the same level of accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Affine OCDM: Designing Chirp-based Multicarrier System with Maximum Diversity and Coding Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of maximizing multipath diversity and coding gains of orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM)-based systems. We define and study an Affine OCDM (A-OCDM) system in which a chirp parameter is adapted based on block size to enable maximum diversity and coding gains offered by frequency selective channels. Unlike linear constellation precoded (LCP)-OCDM, our proposed system effectively reduces implementation complexity while harnessing the full diversity potential offered by frequency-selective channels. Additionally, we explore and characterize the upper bounds on coding gains and diversity offered by linear equalizers (LEs). To further reduce the complexity of receive equalization, we propose a subchirp grouping method to multiplex chirp systems into independent sub-blocks. Corroborating simulations are presented to verify the theoretical results and the proposed A-OCDM system is shown to exhibit similar resilience to interference, while enjoying improved error performance, compared to OCDM.</description>

      <title>Joint Localization, Synchronization and Mapping via Phase-Coherent Distributed Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) systems emerge as a promising technology in beyond 5G and 6G wireless networks to support the deployment of distributed architectures. This paper explores the use of ELAAs to enable joint localization, synchronization and mapping in sub-6 GHz uplink channels, capitalizing on the near-field effects of phase-coherent distributed arrays. We focus on a scenario where a single-antenna user equipment (UE) communicates with a network of access points (APs) distributed in an indoor environment, considering both specular reflections from walls and scattering from objects. The UE is assumed to be unsynchronized to the network, while the APs can be time- and phase-synchronized to each other. We formulate the problem of joint estimation of location, clock offset and phase offset of the UE, and the locations of scattering points (SPs) (i.e., mapping). Through comprehensive Fisher information analysis, we assess the impact of bandwidth, AP array size, wall reflections, SPs and phase synchronization on localization accuracy. Furthermore, we derive the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator, which optimally combines the information collected by all the distributed arrays. To overcome its intractable high dimensionality, we propose a novel three-step algorithm that first estimates phase offset leveraging carrier phase information of line-of-sight (LoS) paths, then determines the UE location and clock offset via LoS paths and wall reflections, and finally locates SPs using a null-space transformation technique. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in distributed architectures supported by radio stripes (RSs) -- an innovative alternative for implementing ELAAs -- while revealing the benefits of carrier phase exploitation and showcasing the interplay between delay and angular information under different bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important locations or objects and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is a fundamental problem in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. In this study, we show that these irregular dynamics in natural videos can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to perform selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose an experimental paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. We then train a stimulus-informed decoder to extract EEG signal components that are correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and show that this decoder can be used on unseen data to detect which of both objects is attended. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap between the target and the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG also captures information about unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design in related fields.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Based Waveform Optimization for MIMO Radar: An Efficient Linear-Proximal Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on radar waveform optimization for minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system. In contrast to conventional approaches relying on semi-definite programming (SDP) and optimization toolboxes like CVX, we introduce a pioneering and efficient waveform optimization approach in this paper. Our proposed algorithm first applies sequential linear approximation to transform the original CRB-based problem with the transmit power constraint into a sequence of convex subproblems. By introducing a proximal term and further leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we derive the optimal closed-form solution for each subproblem. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is then proved rigorously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational complexity -- at least two orders of magnitude lower than the baseline algorithms while maintaining the same radar sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Outlier Rejection for 5G-Based Indoor Positioning in Ray-Tracing-Enabled Industrial Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise and accurate indoor positioning using cellular communication technology remains to be a prerequisite for several industrial applications, including the emergence of a new topic of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). However, the frequently occurring Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions in a heavy multipath dominant industrial scenario challenge the wireless signal propagation, leading to abnormal estimation errors (outliers) in the signal measurements taken at the receiver. In this paper, we investigate the iterative positioning scheme that is robust to the outliers in the Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements. The Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) positioning scheme formulated on the Least Squares (LS) is implemented to reject the outlier measurements and reweight the available ToA samples based on their confidence. Our positioning scheme is validated under 5G frequency bands, including the C-band (3.7 GHz) and the mmWave-band (26.8 GHz) in a Ray-Tracing enabled industrial scenario with different emulation setups.</description>

      <title>From C-Band to mmWave-Band: Ray-Tracing-Assisted 5G-Based Indoor Positioning in Industrial Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private fifth-generation (5G) networks are increasingly becoming the industrys' choice of wireless communication networks for accelerating production processes. In this context, the role of 5G in providing precise positioning services in indoor industrial scenarios has also been actively discussed. However, the achievable indoor positioning accuracy depends on the radio propagation conditions persisting in the scenario. In this paper, using a Ray-Tracing (RT) engine, we investigate the radio environment in C-band (3.775 GHz) as well as the mmWave-band (26.85 GHz) for a detailed 3D geometric model of the dense clutter industrial production hall under different emulation setups and categorize the dominant Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) MultiPath Components (MPCs). We then evaluate the achievable Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDoA) based positioning accuracy in the C-band and the mmWave-band by computing the position of User Equipment (UE) using only first-arriving MPCs.</description>

      <title>Development of a pulse oximeter robust to measurement errors, with the ability to estimate heartrate and transmit data to smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time monitoring of saturated oxygen level of the blood is an important clinical issue gaining great attention in recent years and during COVID 19 pandemic. Monitoring the patients` ventilation and respiration dynamic is widespread and has been adopted as a standard for anesthesia, neonatal care, and post-operative recovery as well. In this paper the fundamentals of current pulse oximeter devices are reviewed and development of a prototype is explained. Our system has two red and infrared light sources radiating to the tissue. The amount of absorbed and transmitted energy is measured by the photodetector, and finally the amount of oxygen content of the blood is estimated based on these values. We used MAX30100 module. Our system has two advantages relating to similar devices; robustness to errors due to power supply variations, ambient light and motion artifacts. Our system has also the ability to estimate heart rate and transmit the data to a smart phone. This makes our proposed system a potentially good hardware for home monitoring of blood oxygen and respiration efficiency if collaborated with a good mobile application for detecting blood de-saturations.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cell-Free MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are prone to privacy violations, once they aim at handling sensitive identifiable information in several applications. This paper raises the necessity of implementing privacy-preservation measures on the design of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. To that purpose, given an adversary model, we propose an iterative framework of two blocks, precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the sensing receivers given communication constraints. The access point selection aims at minimizing the mutual information between the received signal at users and the sensing signal, by rearranging the access points that transmit ISAC-signals and the sensing receivers. Results show that a reduction in the probability of detection by the adversary is obtained with this method.</description>

      <title>Online Proximal ADMM for Graph Learning from Streaming Smooth Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal processing deals with algorithms and signal representations that leverage graph structures for multivariate data analysis. Often said graph topology is not readily available and may be time-varying, hence (dynamic) graph structure learning from nodal (e.g., sensor) observations becomes a critical first step. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for online graph learning using observation streams, assumed to be smooth on the latent graph. Unlike batch algorithms for topology identification from smooth signals, our modus operandi is to process graph signals sequentially and thus keep memory and computational costs in check. To solve the resulting smoothness-regularized, time-varying inverse problem, we develop online and lightweight iterations built upon the proximal variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), well known for its fast convergence in batch settings. The proximal term in the topology updates seamlessly implements a temporal-variation regularization, and we argue the online procedure exhibits sublinear static regret under some simplifying assumptions. Reproducible experiments with synthetic and real graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting to streaming signals and tracking slowly-varying network connectivity. The proposed approach also exhibits better tracking performance (in terms of suboptimality), when compared to state-of-the-art online graph learning baselines.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>NL-COMM: Demonstrating Gains of Non-Linear Processing in Open-RAN Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) designs can substantially increase wireless systems' achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities. However, existing MU-MIMO deployments typically utilize linear processing techniques that, despite their practical benefits, such as low computational complexity and easy integrability, can leave much of the available throughput and connectivity gains unexploited. They typically require many power-intensive antennas and RF chains to support a smaller number of MIMO streams, even when the transmitted information streams are of low rate. Alternatively, non-linear (NL) processing methods can maximize the capabilities of the MIMO channel. Despite their potential, traditional NL methods are challenged by high computational complexity and processing latency, making them impractical for real-time applications, especially in software-based systems envisioned for emerging Open Radio Access Networks (Open-RAN). Additionally, essential functionalities such as rate adaptation (RA) are currently unavailable for NL systems, limiting their practicality in real-world deployments. In this demo, we present the latest capabilities of our advanced NL processing framework (NL-COMM) in real-time and over-the-air, comparing them side-by-side with conventional linear processing. For the first time, NL-COMM not only meets the practical 5G-NR real-time latency requirements in pure software but also does so within a standard-compliant ecosystem. To achieve this, we significantly extended the NL-COMM algorithmic framework to support the first practical RA for NL processing. The demonstrated gains include enhanced connectivity by supporting four MIMO streams with a single base-station antenna, substantially increased throughput, and the ability to halve the number of base-station antennas without any performance loss to linear approaches.</description>

      <title>Speech-Declipping Transformer with Complex Spectrogram and Learnerble Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer-based speech-declipping model that effectively recovers clipped signals across a wide range of input signal-to-distortion ratios (SDRs). While recent time-domain deep neural network (DNN)-based declippers have outperformed traditional handcrafted and spectrogram-based DNN approaches, they still struggle with low-SDR inputs. To address this, we incorporate a transformer-based architecture that operates in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The TF-transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable performance in the speech enhancement task for low-SDR signals but cannot be optimal for the time-domain artifact like clipping. To overcome the limitations of spectrogram-based DNNs, we design an extra convolutional block that directly extracts temporal features from time-domain waveforms. The joint analysis of complex spectrogram and learned temporal features allows the model to improve performance on both high- and low-SDR inputs. Our approach also preserves the unclipped portions of the speech signal during processing, preventing degradation typically seen when only spectral information is used. In evaluations on the VoiceBank-DEMAND and DNS challenge datasets, the proposed model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) declipping models across various metrics, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>A High-Throughput Hardware Accelerator for Lempel-Ziv 4 Compression Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into recent hardware implementations of the Lempel-Ziv 4 (LZ4) algorithm, highlighting two key factors that limit the throughput of single-kernel compressors. Firstly, the actual parallelism exhibited in single-kernel designs falls short of the theoretical potential. Secondly, the clock frequency is constrained due to the presence of the feedback loops. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel scheme that restricts each parallelization window to a single match, thus elevating the level of actual parallelism. Furthermore, by restricting the maximum match length, we eliminate the feedback loops within the architecture, enabling a significant boost in throughput. Finally, we present a high-speed hardware architecture. The implementation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a throughput of up to 16.10 Gb/s, exhibiting a 2.648x improvement over the start-of-the-art. The new design only results in an acceptable compression ratio reduction ranging from 4.93% to 11.68% with various numbers of hash table entries, compared to the LZ4 compression ratio achieved by official software implementations disclosed on GitHub.</description>

      <title>FoME: A Foundation Model for EEG using Adaptive Temporal-Lateral Attention Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a vital tool to measure and record brain activity in neuroscience and clinical applications, yet its potential is constrained by signal heterogeneity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields. Our code will be available at https://github.com/1061413241/FoME.</description>

      <title>ViolinDiff: Enhancing Expressive Violin Synthesis with Pitch Bend Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online: daewoung.github.io/ViolinDiff-Demo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ConvexECG, an explainable and resource-efficient method for reconstructing six-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) from single-lead data, aimed at advancing personalized and continuous cardiac monitoring. ConvexECG leverages a convex reformulation of a two-layer ReLU neural network, enabling the potential for efficient training and deployment in resource constrained environments, while also having deterministic and explainable behavior. Using data from 25 patients, we demonstrate that ConvexECG achieves accuracy comparable to larger neural networks while significantly reducing computational overhead, highlighting its potential for real-time, low-resource monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Stacked Intelligent Metasurface for Enhanced Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: A Low-Power and Cost Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of low-power, low-cost stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems to enhance access point (AP) capabilities and address high power consumption and cost challenges. Specifically, we investigate the uplink performance of a SIM-enhanced CF mMIMO system and propose a novel system framework. First, the closed-form expressions of the spectral efficiency (SE) are obtained using the unique two-layer signal processing framework of CF mMIMO systems. Second, to mitigate inter-user interference, an interference-based greedy algorithm for pilot allocation is introduced. Third, a wave-based beamforming algorithm for SIM is proposed, based only on statistical channel state information, which effectively reduces the fronthaul costs. Finally, a max-min SE power control algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of UE with inferior channel conditions. The results indicate that increasing the number of SIM layers and meta-atoms leads to significant performance improvements and allows for a reduction in the number of APs and AP antennas, thus lowering the costs. In particular, the best SE performance is achieved with the deployment of 20 APs plus 1200 SIM meta-atoms. Finally, the proposed wave-based beamforming algorithm can enhance the SE performance of SIM-enhanced CF-mMIMO systems by 57\%, significantly outperforming traditional CF mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Precoding for SIM-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems are emerging as promising alternatives to cellular networks, especially in ultra-dense environments. However, further capacity enhancement requires the deployment of more access points (APs), which will lead to high costs and high energy consumption. To address this issue, in this paper, we explore the integration of low-power, low-cost stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into CF mMIMO systems to enhance AP capabilities. The key point is that SIM performs precoding-related matrix operations in the wave domain. As a consequence, each AP antenna only needs to transmit data streams for a single user equipment (UE), eliminating the need for complex baseband digital precoding. Then, we formulate the problem of joint AP-UE association and precoding at APs and SIMs to maximize the system sum rate. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a two-stage signal processing framework to solve it. In particular, in the first stage, we propose an AP antenna greedy association (AGA) algorithm to minimize UE interference. In the second stage, we introduce an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that separates the joint power and wave-based precoding optimization problem into two distinct sub-problems: the complex quadratic transform method is used for AP antenna power control, and the projection gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm is employed to find suboptimal solutions for the SIM wave-based precoding. Finally, the numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and assess the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to various benchmark schemes. The results show that, with the same number of SIM meta-atoms, the proposed algorithm improves the sum rate by approximately 275% compared to the benchmark scheme.</description>

      <title>MI-BMInet: An Efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Motor Imagery Brain--Machine Interfaces with EEG Channel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14592v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A brain--machine interface (BMI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables the control of devices using brain signals while the subject imagines performing a movement. It plays a vital role in prosthesis control and motor rehabilitation. To improve user comfort, preserve data privacy, and reduce the system's latency, a new trend in wearable BMIs is to execute algorithms on low-power microcontroller units (MCUs) embedded on edge devices to process the electroencephalographic (EEG) data in real-time close to the sensors. However, most of the classification models present in the literature are too resource-demanding, making them unfit for low-power MCUs. This paper proposes an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) for EEG-based MI classification that achieves comparable accuracy while being orders of magnitude less resource-demanding and significantly more energy-efficient than state-of-the-art (SoA) models for a long-lifetime battery operation. To further reduce the model complexity, we propose an automatic channel selection method based on spatial filters and quantize both weights and activations to 8-bit precision with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, we implement and evaluate the proposed models on leading-edge parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) MCUs. The final 2-class solution consumes as little as 30 uJ/inference with a runtime of 2.95 ms/inference and an accuracy of 82.51% while using 6.4x fewer EEG channels, becoming the new SoA for embedded MI-BMI and defining a new Pareto frontier in the three-way trade-off among accuracy, resource cost, and power usage.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sensor Placement Based on Sampling Theory for Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem where sensors can move within a network over time. Sensor placement problem aims to select K sensor positions from N candidates where K &lt; N. Most existing methods assume that sensor positions are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile sensors like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time. Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed, which are difficult to cover with statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the network. We dynamically determine the sensor positions based on graph signal sampling theory such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best recovered from the observations. For signal recovery, the dictionary is learned from a pool of observed signals. It is also used for the sensor position selection. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method via the mean squared error of the reconstructed signals. The proposed dynamic sensor placement outperforms the existing static ones for both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate Descent Approach to Atomic Norm Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic norm minimization is of great interest in various applications of sparse signal processing including super-resolution line-spectral estimation and signal denoising. In practice, atomic norm minimization (ANM) is formulated as semi-definite programming (SDP) that is generally hard to solve. This work introduces a low-complexity solver for a type of ANM known as atomic norm soft thresholding (AST). The proposed method uses the framework of coordinate descent and exploits the sparsity-inducing nature of atomic-norm regularization. Specifically, this work first provides an equivalent, non-convex formulation of AST. It is then proved that applying a coordinate descent algorithm on the non-convex formulation leads to convergence to the global solution. For the case of a single measurement vector of length N and complex exponential basis, the complexity of each step in the coordinate descent procedure is O(N log N ), rendering the method efficient for large-scale problems. Through simulations, the proposed solver is shown to be faster than alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) or customized interior point SDP solver if the problems are sparse. It is demonstrated that the coordinate descent solver can be modified for AST with multiple dimensions and multiple measurement vectors as well as a variety of general basis.</description>

      <title>3D Cooperative Localization in UAV Systems: CRLB Analysis and Security Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy framework for achieving accurate cooperative localization in multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. The Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB) for the three-dimensional (3D) cooperative localization network is derived, with particular attention given to practical scenarios involving non-uniform spatial distribution of anchor nodes. Challenges of mobility are then addressed with Mobility Adaptive Gradient Descent (MAGD).
  In the context of system security, we derive the CRLB of localization under the influence of falsified information. The methods and strategies of injecting such information and their impact on system performance are studied. To assure robust performance under falsified data, we propose a mitigation solution named Time-evolving Anomaly Detection (TAD). Furthermore, we model the system performance regarding the density and magnitude of falsified information, focusing on realistic scenarios where the adversary is resource-constrained. With the vulnerability of cooperative localization understood, we apply TAD and formulate an optimization problem from the adversary's perspective. Next, we discuss the design principles of an anomaly detector, with emphasis of the trade-off of reducing such optimum and system performance. Additionally, we also deploy a reputation propagation (RP) mechanism to fully utilize the anomaly detection and further optimize the TAD. Our proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose greedy Capon beamformer (GCB) for direction finding of narrow-band sources present in the array's viewing field. After defining the grid covering the location search space, the algorithm greedily builds the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix by identifying a high-power source on the grid using Capon's principle of maximizing the signal to interference plus noise ratio while enforcing unit gain towards the signal of interest. An estimate of the power of the detected source is derived by exploiting the unit power constraint, which subsequently allows to update the noise covariance matrix by simple rank-1 matrix addition composed of outerproduct of the selected steering matrix with itself scaled by the signal power estimate. Our numerical examples demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed GCB in direction finding where it performs favourably compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms under a broad variety of settings. Furthermore, GCB estimates of direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) are very fast to compute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems of uniform linear array (with uniform mutual coupling) calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation are re-examined for application in the receive arrays of modern High Frequency Over-the-Horizon Radars (HF OTHR). Specifics of these arrays, operating predominantly in the "over-sampled" (d/$\lambda$ &lt; 0.5) regime, are exploited along with the recent findings in the Toeplitz Inverse Eigenvalue problem (ToIEP), Random Matrix Theory, and the "Expected Likelihood" methodology developed earlier to advance the problem solution. In this paper we re-evaluate the benchmark efficiency of the "blind" calibration and analyze several techniques that are based on certain properties of the Toeplitz covariance matrix and "over-sampled" uniform antenna arrays, but do not require matrix estimation. In Part II we analyze the case of the unknown symmetric and Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and introduce techniques for joint antenna calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a cornerstone technology for the forth upcoming sixth generation era, seamlessly incorporating sensing functionality into wireless networks as a native capability. The main challenges in efficient ISAC are constituted by its limited sensing and communication coverage, as well as severe inter-cell interference. Network-level ISAC relying on multi-cell cooperation is capable of effectively expanding both the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) coverage and of providing extra degrees of freedom (DoF) for realizing increased integration gains between S&amp;C. In this work, we provide new considerations for ISAC networks, including new metrics, the optimization of the DoF, cooperation regimes, and highlight new S&amp;C tradeoffs. Then, we discuss a suite of cooperative S&amp;C architectures both at the task, as well as data, and signal levels. Furthermore, the interplay between S&amp;C at the network level is investigated and promising research directions are outlined.</description>
