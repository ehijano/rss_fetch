      <title>Beamforming with Joint Phase and Time Array: System Design, Prototyping and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) is a new mmWave radio frequency front-end architecture constructed with appending time-delay elements to phase shifters for analog beamforming. JPTA allows the mmWave base station (BS) to form multiple frequency-dependent beams with a single RF chain, exploiting the extra degrees of freedom the time-delay elements offer. Without requiring extra power-hungry RF chains, a BS with JPTA can schedule multiple users in different directions in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) manner. A BS with JPTA achieves various advantages over the traditional analog beamforming system. Simulation results show that JPTA can bring significant system-level benefits, e.g., extending uplink throughput coverage by 100%. To realize these system benefits of JPTA, high-resolution delay elements with a wide delay dynamic range are essential. With newly developed delay elements, we demonstrate that a single TRX RF chain can serve four users in four different directions in the mmWave band.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dataset Nature through Algorithmic Clustering based on String Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text datasets can be represented using models that do not preserve text structure, or using models that preserve text structure. Our hypothesis is that depending on the dataset nature, there can be advantages using a model that preserves text structure over one that does not, and viceversa. The key is to determine the best way of representing a particular dataset, based on the dataset itself. In this work, we propose to investigate this problem by combining text distortion and algorithmic clustering based on string compression. Specifically, a distortion technique previously developed by the authors is applied to destroy text structure progressively. Following this, a clustering algorithm based on string compression is used to analyze the effects of the distortion on the information contained in the texts. Several experiments are carried out on text datasets and artificially-generated datasets. The results show that in strongly structural datasets the clustering results worsen as text structure is progressively destroyed. Besides, they show that using a compressor which enables the choice of the size of the left-context symbols helps to determine the nature of the datasets. Finally, the results are contrasted with a method based on multidimensional projections and analogous conclusions are obtained.</description>

      <title>AoI in M/G/1/1 Queues with Probabilistic Preemption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a status update system consisting of one source, one server, and one sink. The source generates packets according to a Poisson process and the packets are served according to a generally distributed service time. We consider a system with a capacity of one packet, i.e., there is no waiting buffer in the system, and model it as an M/G/1/1 queueing system. We introduce a probabilistically preemptive packet management policy and calculate the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the age of information (AoI) and peak AoI (PAoI) under the policy. According to the probabilistically preemptive policy, when a packet arrives, the possible packet in the system is replaced by the arriving packet with a fixed probability. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the packet management policy.</description>

      <title>On the Source Model Key Agreement Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the source model key agreement problem involving two legitimate parties and an eavesdropper who observe n i.i.d. samples of X and Y and Z respectively. The best-known upper bound on the key capacity is characterized by an inf-max optimization problem that generally lacks a closed-form solution. In this paper, we solve the optimization for some class of sources, thereby providing simple expressions for the upper bound. We provide general conditions under which the upper bound reduces to I(X;Y). As an example, we consider the XOR setting in which X and Y are binary, and Z is the XOR of X and Y . The upper bound reduces to I(X;Y) for this source. Next, we conjecture that the rate I(X;Y) is not achievable for the XOR source, and provide some ideas that might be useful for developing a new upper bound on the source model problem.</description>

      <title>The Query/Hit Model for Sequential Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Query/Hit (Q/H) learning model. The setup consists of two agents. One agent, Alice, has access to a streaming source, while the other, Bob, does not have direct access to the source. Communication occurs through sequential Q/H pairs: Bob sends a sequence of source symbols (queries), and Alice responds with the waiting time until each query appears in the source stream (hits). This model is motivated by scenarios with communication, computation, and privacy constraints that limit real-time access to the source. The error exponent for sequential hypothesis testing under the Q/H model is characterized, and a querying strategy, the Dynamic Scout-Sentinel Algorithm (DSSA), is proposed. The strategy employs a mutual information neural estimator to compute the error exponent associated with each query and to select the query with the highest efficiency. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets -- including mouse movement trajectories, typesetting patterns, and touch-based user interactions -- are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in comparison with baselines, in terms of probability of error, query choice, and time-to-detection.</description>

      <title>Constructing Fundamentals for the Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions Applied Interdisciplinarily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions applied Interdisciplinary (TPASAI) is a framework that integrates mathematics, linguistics, psychology, and game theory to uncover hidden patterns and proportions in reality. Its central idea is that numerical encoding of symbols, dates, and language can reveal recurring structures and connections that reflect universal principles. By applying fractal analysis, the theory identifies patterns across different scales, offering a unifying perspective on the structure of the world. One key aspect of TPASAI is symbolic analysis, which allows for the reinterpretation of traumatic experiences in psychotherapy. For example, assigning numerical values to elements like fingers, dates, or words can help individuals uncover meaningful associations between personal experiences and collective symbols. This approach encourages cognitive flexibility and provides a therapeutic avenue for recontextualizing emotions. The theory also incorporates principles of game theory, which frame reality as a system of symbolic "codes" governed by rules that can be understood and strategically used. This perspective is especially useful for psychological conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), enabling patients to approach their obsessions as decipherable patterns rather than rigid constraints. TPASAI has practical applications in psychology, education, and technology. In education, it aids in teaching mathematical and linguistic concepts by exploring connections between symbolic representations and real-world events. In technology, the methodology can be employed in ciphering and natural language processing. The innovation of TPASAI lies in its ability to merge the structured rigor of mathematics with the interpretative flexibility of symbolic analysis, offering a deeper understanding of events and relationships.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Cell Deployment Optimization for Capacity and Coverage of Ground and UAV Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general mathematical framework for optimizing cell deployment and antenna configuration in wireless networks, inspired by quantization theory. Unlike traditional methods, our framework supports networks with deterministically located nodes, enabling modeling and optimization under controlled deployment scenarios. We demonstrate our framework through two applications: joint fine-tuning of antenna parameters across base stations (BSs) to optimize network coverage, capacity, and load balancing, and the strategic deployment of new BSs, including the optimization of their locations and antenna settings. These optimizations are conducted for a heterogeneous 3D user population, comprising ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) along aerial corridors. Our case studies highlight the framework's versatility in optimizing performance metrics such as the coverage-capacity trade-off and capacity per region. Our results confirm that optimizing the placement and orientation of additional BSs consistently outperforms approaches focused solely on antenna adjustments, regardless of GUE distribution. Furthermore, joint optimization for both GUEs and UAVs significantly enhances UAV service without severely affecting GUE performance.</description>

      <title>Parallel Coding for Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel parallel coding transmission strategy and an iterative detection and decoding receiver signal processing technique for orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a parallel channel encoding (PCE) scheme that consists of multiple short-length codewords for each delay-Doppler multicarrier (DDMC) symbol. Building upon such a PCE transmission framework, we then introduce an iterative detection and decoding algorithm incorporating a successive decoding feedback (SDF) technique, which enables instant information exchange between the detector and decoder for each DDMC symbol. To characterize the error performance of the proposed scheme, we perform density evolution analysis considering the finite blocklength effects. Our analysis results, coupled with extensive simulations, demonstrate that the proposed PCE scheme with the SDF algorithm not only showcases a better overall performance but also requires much less decoding complexity to implement, compared to the conventional benchmark scheme that relies on a single long channel code for coding the entire ODDM frame.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the parametrization of deep convolutional neural networks on post-training quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces novel theoretical approximation bounds for the output of quantized neural networks, with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNN). By considering layerwise parametrization and focusing on the quantization of weights, we provide bounds that gain several orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the art results on classical deep convolutional neural netorks such as MobileNetV2 or ResNets. These gains are achieved by improving the behaviour of the approximation bounds with respect to the depth parameter, which has the most impact on the approximation error induced by quantization. To complement our theoretical result, we provide a numerical exploration of our bounds on Mo-bileNetV2 and ResNets.</description>

      <title>On the Uncertainty of a Simple Estimator for Remote Source Monitoring over ALOHA Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient remote monitoring of distributed sources is essential for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This work studies the uncertainty at the receiver when tracking two-state Markov sources over a slotted random access channel without feedback, using the conditional entropy as a performance indicator, and considering the last received value as current state estimate. We provide an analytical characterization of the metric, and evaluate three access strategies: (i) maximizing throughput, (ii) transmitting only on state changes, and (iii) minimizing uncertainty through optimized access probabilities. Our results reveal that throughput optimization does not always reduce uncertainty. Moreover, while reactive policies are optimal for symmetric sources, asymmetric processes benefit from mixed strategies allowing transmissions during state persistence.</description>

      <title>Downlink Beamforming with Pinching-Antenna Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas have been recently proposed as a promising flexible-antenna technology, which can be implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of employing pinching antenna systems (PASs) for downlink transmission in a multiuser MIMO setting. We consider the problem of hybrid beamforming, where the digital precoder at the access point and the activated locations of the pinching elements are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming, a novel low-complexity algorithm is developed to iteratively update the precoding matrix and the locations of the pinching antennas. We validate the proposed scheme through extensive numerical experiments. Our investigations demonstrate that using PAS the system throughput can be significantly boosted as compared with the conventional fixed-location antenna systems, enlightening the potential of PAS as an enabling candidate for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Accurately Estimating Unreported Infections using Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in combating against the spread of infectious diseases was the difficulty in estimating the true magnitude of infections. Unreported infections could drive up disease spread, making it very hard to accurately estimate the infectivity of the pathogen, therewith hampering our ability to react effectively. Despite the use of surveillance-based methods such as serological studies, identifying the true magnitude is still challenging. This paper proposes an information theoretic approach for accurately estimating the number of total infections. Our approach is built on top of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models, which are commonly used in epidemiology and for estimating such infections. We show how we can help such models to better compute the number of total infections and identify the parametrization by which we need the fewest bits to describe the observed dynamics of reported infections. Our experiments on COVID-19 spread show that our approach leads to not only substantially better estimates of the number of total infections but also better forecasts of infections than standard model calibration based methods. We additionally show how our learned parametrization helps in modeling more accurate what-if scenarios with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our approach provides a general method for improving epidemic modeling which is applicable broadly.</description>

      <title>Formalising Propositional Information via Implication Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for quantifying the information content of logical propositions through the use of implication hypergraphs. We posit that a proposition's informativeness is primarily determined by its relationships with other propositions -- specifically, the extent to which it implies or derives other propositions. To formalize this notion, we develop a framework based on implication hypergraphs, that seeks to capture these relationships. Within this framework, we define propositional information, derive some key properties, and illustrate the concept through examples. While the approach is broadly applicable, mathematical propositions emerge as an ideal domain for its application due to their inherently rich and interconnected structure. We provide several examples to illustrate this and subsequently discuss the limitations of the framework, along with suggestions for potential refinements.</description>

      <title>BICompFL: Stochastic Federated Learning with Bi-Directional Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the prominent communication bottleneck in federated learning (FL). We specifically consider stochastic FL, in which models or compressed model updates are specified by distributions rather than deterministic parameters. Stochastic FL offers a principled approach to compression, and has been shown to reduce the communication load under perfect downlink transmission from the federator to the clients. However, in practice, both the uplink and downlink communications are constrained. We show that bi-directional compression for stochastic FL has inherent challenges, which we address by introducing BICompFL. Our BICompFL is experimentally shown to reduce the communication cost by an order of magnitude compared to multiple benchmarks, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracies. Theoretically, we study the communication cost of BICompFL through a new analysis of an importance-sampling based technique, which exposes the interplay between uplink and downlink communication costs.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Clustering based on String Compression to Extract P300 Structure in EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P300 is an Event-Related Potential widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces, but its detection is challenging due to inter-subject and temporal variability. This work introduces a clustering methodology based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the P300 structure, ensuring robustness against variability. We propose a novel signal-to-ASCII transformation to generate compression-friendly objects, which are then clustered using a hierarchical tree-based method and a multidimensional projection approach. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reveal relevant P300 structures, showing clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, analysis at the electrode level suggests that the method could assist in electrode selection for P300 detection. This compression-driven clustering methodology offers a complementary tool for EEG analysis and P300 identification.</description>

      <title>On Multiquantum Bits, Segre Embeddings and Coxeter Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the interplay between quantum information theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, with a particular focus on multiqubit systems, their entanglement structure, and their classification via geometric embeddings. The Segre embedding, a fundamental construction in algebraic geometry, provides an algebraic framework to distinguish separable and entangled states, encoding quantum correlations in projective geometry. We develop a systematic study of qubit moduli spaces, illustrating the geometric structure of entanglement through hypercube constructions and Coxeter chamber decompositions.
  We establish a bijection between the Segre embeddings of tensor products of projective spaces and binary words of length $n-1$, structured as an $(n-1)$-dimensional hypercube, where adjacency corresponds to a single Segre operation. This reveals a combinatorial structure underlying the hierarchy of embeddings, with direct implications for quantum error correction schemes. The symmetry of the Segre variety under the Coxeter group of type $A$ allows us to analyze quantum states and errors through the lens of reflection groups, viewing separable states as lying in distinct Coxeter chambers on a Segre variety. The transitive action of the permutation group on these chambers provides a natural method for tracking errors in quantum states and potentially reversing them. Beyond foundational aspects, we highlight relations between Segre varieties and Dixon elliptic curves, drawing connections between entanglement and number theory.</description>

      <title>Scalable Precise Computation of Shannon Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative information flow analyses (QIF) are a class of techniques for measuring the amount of confidential information leaked by a program to its public outputs.
  Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF.
  This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE.
  In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition.
  \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation.
  In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs.
  We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probably approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the existing precise tools.
  The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 55 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 441. For 98% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>PtyGenography: using generative models for regularization of the phase retrieval problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phase retrieval and similar inverse problems, the stability of solutions across different noise levels is crucial for applications. One approach to promote it is using signal priors in a form of a generative model as a regularization, at the expense of introducing a bias in the reconstruction. In this paper, we explore and compare the reconstruction properties of classical and generative inverse problem formulations. We propose a new unified reconstruction approach that mitigates overfitting to the generative model for varying noise levels.</description>

      <title>Reducing Ciphertext and Key Sizes for MLWE-Based Cryptosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concatenation of encryption and decryption can be interpreted as data transmission over a noisy communication channel. In this work, we use finite blocklength methods (normal approximation and random coding union bound) as well as asymptotics to show that ciphertext and key sizes of the state-of-the-art post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) Kyber can be reduced without compromising the security of the scheme. We show that in the asymptotic regime, it is possible to reduce the sizes of ciphertexts and secret keys by 25% for the parameter set Kyber1024 while keeping the bitrate at 1 as proposed in the original scheme. For a single Kyber encryption block used to share a 256-bit AES key, we furthermore show that reductions in ciphertext size of 39% and 33% are possible for Kyber1024 and Kyber512, respectively.</description>

      <title>Predicting symmetries of quantum dynamics with optimal samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying symmetries in quantum dynamics, such as identity or time-reversal invariance, is a crucial challenge with profound implications for quantum technologies. We introduce a unified framework combining group representation theory and subgroup hypothesis testing to predict these symmetries with optimal efficiency. By exploiting the inherent symmetry of compact groups and their irreducible representations, we derive an exact characterization of the optimal type-II error (failure probability to detect a symmetry), offering an operational interpretation for the quantum max-relative entropy. In particular, we prove that parallel strategies achieve the same performance as adaptive or indefinite-causal-order protocols, resolving debates about the necessity of complex control sequences. Applications to the singleton group, maximal commutative group, and orthogonal group yield explicit results: for predicting the identity property, Z-symmetry, and T-symmetry of unknown qubit unitaries, with zero type-I error and type-II error bounded by $\delta$, we establish the explicit optimal sample complexity which scales as $\mathcal{O}(\delta^{-1/3})$ for identity testing and $\mathcal{O}(\delta^{-1/2})$ for T/Z-symmetry testing. These findings offer theoretical insights and practical guidelines for efficient unitary property testing and symmetry-driven protocols in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Multi-Index Models: Precise Asymptotics and Optimal Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models provide a popular framework to investigate the learnability of functions with low-dimensional structure and, also due to their connections with neural networks, they have been object of recent intensive study. In this paper, we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the signals via spectral estimators -- a family of methods that are routinely used in practice, often as a warm-start for iterative algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow proportionally and the dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically, we locate the top-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps between the corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and a basis of the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon in which, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the spectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired subspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization of the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator that requires the minimal sample size for weak recovery.</description>

      <title>Design of Pulse Shapes Based on Sampling with Gaussian Prefilter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2412</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new pulse shapes for communications are presented. The first pulse shape generates a set of pulses without intersymbol interferenc (ISI) or is ISI-free for short. In the neighbourhood of the origin it is similar in shape to the classical cardinal sine function but is of exponential decay at infinity. This pulse shape is identical to the interpolating function of a recent sampling theorem with Gaussian prefilter. The second pulse shape is obtained from the first pulse shape by spectral factorization. Besides being also of exponential decay at infinity, it has a causal appearance since it is of superexponential decay for negative times. It is closely related to the orthonormal generating function considered earlier by Unser in the context of shift-invariant spaces. This pulse shape is not ISI-free but it generates a set of orthonormal pulses. The second pulse shape may also be used to define a receive matched filter so that at the filter output the ISI-free pulses of the first kind are recovered.</description>

      <title>Blind Channel Estimation and Joint Symbol Detection with Data-Driven Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the factor graph framework for blind joint channel estimation and symbol detection on time-variant linear inter-symbol interference channels. In particular, we consider the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, which typically suffers from high complexity as it requires the computation of the symbol-wise posterior distributions in every iteration. We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the $q$-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ``anti-contractivity'' introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <title>Performance of Double-Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Multiuser Massive MIMO Communications in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for shaping the propagation environment, it consists of a single-layer structure within inherent limitations regarding the number of beam steering patterns. Based on the recently revolutionary technology, denoted as stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), we propose its implementation not only on the base station (BS) side in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup but also in the intermediate space between the base station and the users to adjust the environment further as needed. For the sake of convenience, we call the former BS SIM (BSIM), and the latter channel SIM (CSIM). Hence, we achieve wave-based combining at the BS and wave-based configuration at the intermediate space. Specifically, we propose a channel estimation method with reduced overhead, being crucial for SIMassisted communications. Next, we derive the uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Notably, we optimize the phase shifts of both BSIM and CSIM simultaneously by using the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Compared to previous works on SIMs, we study the uplink transmission, a mMIMO setup, channel estimation in a single phase, a second SIM at the intermediate space, and simultaneous optimization of the two SIMs. Simulation results show the impact of various parameters on the sum SE, and demonstrate the superiority of our optimization approach compared to the alternating optimization (AO) method.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Identification Codes for Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many communication applications incorporate event-triggered behavior, where the conventional Shannon capacity may not effectively gauge performance. Consequently, we advocate for the concept of identification capacity as a more suitable metric for assessing these systems. We consider deterministic identification codes for the Gaussian AWGN, the slow fading, and the fast fading channels with power constraints. We prove lower bounds on capacities for the slow and the fast fading channels with side information for a wide range of fading distributions. Additionally, we present the code construction with efficient encoding which achieves the lower bound on capacity both for the slow and the fast fading channels.
  At last, we prove the same lower bound on the capacity of the fast fading channel without side information, i.e., the same lower bound holds even when the receiver does not know the fading coefficients.
  As a result we show that compared with Shannon's message transmission paradigm we achieved completely different capacity scaling for deterministic identification codes for all relevant fading channels.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna access points (APs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each AP selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Our work addresses the well-known open problem of distributed computing of bilinear functions of two correlated sources ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$. In a setting with two nodes, with the first node having access to ${\bf A}$ and the second to ${\bf B}$, we establish bounds on the optimal sum-rate that allows a receiver to compute an important class of non-linear functions, and in particular bilinear functions, including dot products $\langle {\bf A},{\bf B}\rangle$, and general matrix products ${\bf A}^{\intercal}{\bf B}$ over finite fields. The bounds are tight, for large field sizes, for which case we can derive the exact fundamental performance limits for all problem dimensions and a large class of sources. Our achievability scheme involves the design of non-linear transformations of ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$, which are carefully calibrated to work synergistically with the structured linear encoding scheme by K\"orner and Marton. The subsequent converse derived here, calibrates the Han-Kobayashi approach to yield a relatively tight converse on the sum rate. We also demonstrate unbounded compression gains over Slepian-Wolf coding, depending on the source correlations. In the end, our work derives fundamental limits for distributed computing of a crucial class of functions, succinctly capturing the computation structures and source correlations.
  Our findings are subsequently applied to the practical master-workers-receiver framework, where each of $N$ distributed workers has a bounded memory reflecting a bounded computational capability. By combining the above scheme with the polynomial code framework, we design novel structured polynomial codes for distributed matrix multiplication, and show that our codes can surpass the performance of the existing state of art, while also adapting these new codes to support chain matrix multiplications and information-theoretically secure computations.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous Decoding Approach to Joint State and Message Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity-distortion (C-D) trade-off for joint state and message communications (JSMC) over state-dependent point-to-point, degraded broadcast, and multiple access channels are investigated, where the transmitters have access to noisy state information and feedback, while the receivers jointly decode the messages and estimate the channel state. A coding scheme is proposed based on backward simultaneous decoding of messages and compressed state descriptions without the need for the Wyner-Ziv random binning technique. For the point-to-point channel, the proposed scheme results in the optimal C-D function. For state-dependent discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channel (SD-DMDBC), the successive refinement method is adopted for designing state descriptions. With the simultaneous decoding approach, the derived achievable region is shown to be larger than the region obtained by the sequential decoding approach that is utilized in existing works. As for the state-dependent discrete memoryless multiple access channel (SD-DMMAC), in addition to the proposed scheme, Willem's coding strategy is applied to enable partial collaboration between transmitters through the feedback links. Moreover, the state descriptions are shown to enhance both communication and state estimation performance. Examples are provided for the derived results to verify the analysis, either numerically or analytically. With particular focus, simple but representative integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems are also considered, and their fundamental performance limits are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an expression for the expected number of runs in a trace of a binary sequence $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ obtained by passing $x$ through a deletion channel that independently deletes each bit with probability $q$. We use this expression to show that if $x$ is a codeword of a first-order Reed-Muller code, and the deletion probability $q$ is 1/2, then $x$ can be reconstructed, with high probability, from $\tilde{O}(n)$ many of its traces.</description>

Abstract: This papers consider a two terminal problem, where Alice and Bob jointly want to perform a measurement on a bipartite quantum system $\rho^{AB}$. Alice can transmit the results of her measurements to Bob on a classical channel, and Alice and Bob have common randomness.

      <title>A MIMO ISAC System for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system to detect the arrival of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a dual-function base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing based ISAC and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.</description>

      <title>A proof of P != NP (New symmetric encryption algorithm against any linear attacks and differential attacks)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P vs NP problem is the most important unresolved problem in the field of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key, and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on "one-way" assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P != NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P != NP.</description>

      <title>Higher rank antipodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in S$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv}(S)$ to the $k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ bijectively onto the $k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By connecting rank-$k$ antipodality to $k$-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another upper bound when $k&gt;d/2$.</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning of Physical Object Properties Through Robot Manipulation and Database of Object Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for automatically extracting physical object properties, such as material composition, mass, volume, and stiffness, through robot manipulation and a database of object measurements. The framework involves exploratory action selection to maximize learning about objects on a table. A Bayesian network models conditional dependencies between object properties, incorporating prior probability distributions and uncertainty associated with measurement actions. The algorithm selects optimal exploratory actions based on expected information gain and updates object properties through Bayesian inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective action selection compared to a baseline and correct termination of the experiments if there is nothing more to be learned. The algorithm proved to behave intelligently when presented with trick objects with material properties in conflict with their appearance. The robot pipeline integrates with a logging module and an online database of objects, containing over 24,000 measurements of 63 objects with different grippers. All code and data are publicly available, facilitating automatic digitization of objects and their physical properties through exploratory manipulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thompson Sampling is a principled method for balancing exploration and exploitation, but its real-world adoption is impeded by the high computational overhead of posterior maintenance in large-scale or non-conjugate settings. Ensemble-based approaches offer partial remedies, but often require a large ensemble size. This paper proposes the Ensemble++, a scalable agent that sidesteps these limitations by a shared-factor ensemble update architecture and a random linear combination scheme. We theoretically justify that in linear bandits, Ensemble++ agent only needs an ensemble size of $\Theta(d \log T)$ to achieve regret guarantees comparable to exact Thompson Sampling. Further, to handle nonlinear rewards and complex environments. we introduce a neural extension that replaces fixed features with a learnable representation, preserving the same underlying objective via gradient-based updates. Empirical results confirm that Ensemble++ agent excel in both sample efficiency and computational scalability across linear and nonlinear environments, including GPT-based contextual bandits.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Multi-Level Spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have shown that embedding a small payload within each spike exchanged between spiking neurons can enhance inference accuracy without increasing energy consumption. To scale neuromorphic computing to larger workloads, split computing - where an SNN is partitioned across two devices - is a promising solution. In such architectures, the device hosting the initial layers must transmit information about the spikes generated by its output neurons to the second device. This establishes a trade-off between the benefits of multi-level spikes, which carry additional payload information, and the communication resources required for transmitting extra bits between devices. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of a neuromorphic wireless split computing architecture that employs multi-level SNNs. We propose digital and analog modulation schemes for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to enable efficient communication. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios reveal performance improvements achieved by multi-level SNN models and provide insights into the optimal payload size as a function of the connection quality between the transmitter and receiver.</description>

      <title>On the Goppa morphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric foundations of the space of geometric Goppa codes using the Tsfasman-Vladut H-construction. These codes are constructed from level structures, which extend the classical Goppa framework by incorporating invertible sheaves and their trivializations over rational points. A key contribution is the definition of the Goppa morphism, a map from the universal moduli space of level structures, denoted $LS_{g,n,d}$, to certain Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$. This morphism allows problems related to distinguishing attacks and key recovery in the context of Goppa Code-based Cryptography to be translated into a geometric language, addressing questions about the equations defining the image of the Goppa morphism and its fibers. Furthermore, we identify the ranges of the degree parameter $d$ that should be avoided to maintain security against distinguishers. Our results, valid over arbitrary base fields, also apply to convolutional Goppa codes.</description>

      <title>Online Clustering with Bandit Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online clustering within the multi-armed bandit framework under the fixed confidence setting. In this multi-armed bandit problem, we have $M$ arms, each providing i.i.d. samples that follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with an {\em unknown} mean and a known unit covariance. The arms are grouped into $K$ clusters based on the distance between their means using the Single Linkage (SLINK) clustering algorithm on the means of the arms. Since the true means are unknown, the objective is to obtain the above clustering of the arms with the minimum number of samples drawn from the arms, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We introduce a novel algorithm, Average Tracking Bandit Online Clustering (ATBOC), and prove that this algorithm is order optimal, meaning that the upper bound on its expected sample complexity for given error probability $\delta$ is within a factor of 2 of an instance-dependent lower bound as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, we propose a computationally more efficient algorithm, Lower and Upper Confidence Bound-based Bandit Online Clustering (LUCBBOC), inspired by the LUCB algorithm for best arm identification. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of LUCBBOC is comparable to that of ATBOC. We numerically assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on both synthetic datasets and the real-world MovieLens dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on bandit online clustering that allows arms with different means in a cluster and $K$ greater than 2.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>
