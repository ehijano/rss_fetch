      <title>Self-similarity and growth of non-linear magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability -- Role of the magnetic field strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear regime of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) plays a crucial role in the transportation and mixing of material in a wide range of laboratory to astrophysical systems. But several fundamental aspects of this regime remain poorly understood. Previous MRTI studies assumed MRTI to have a self-similar, quadratic growth in the non-linear regime, similar to the hydrodynamic (HD) RTI. However, neither the self-similarity nor the relevance of the HD scaling for the MRTI has been proved analytically. Further, the role of magnetic field on the evolution of the instability remain unexplored. Towards this, we perform analytical and numerical study of the MRTI with uniform magnetic field. Our study reveals that the imposed magnetic field deviates the MRTI evolution from self-similarity. However, the HD RTI scaling becomes relevant to the MRTI evolution when the non-linear dynamics dominate the imposed magnetic field. A formula for the $\alpha_{mhd}$, a quantity which represents the non-linear growth of instability in the self-similar regime, was obtained. The formula of $\alpha_{mhd}$ highlight the physical processes that could dictate the growth of instability. Numerical simulations of the MRTI showed the quantitative variation of these physical processes and $\alpha_{mhd}$ across a wide range of magnetic field strengths. Thus, the current study proves, analytically and numerically, the role of magnetic fields on the evolution of MRTI and the factors that influence of non-linear growth constant of the instability.</description>

      <title>MSPINN: Physics-informed neural networks combined with multiple scale method for reconstructing transient natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct multiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on instantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection problems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of fields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors are observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits relatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that reconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing solution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields. Furthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions where the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations often manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based reconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale variations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To mitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a multi-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and reformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum and mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights into the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with large solution space and field variations across multiple scales.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent heat transport by baroclinic acoustic streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standing acoustic waves have been known to generate Eulerian time-mean 'streaming' flows at least since the seminal investigation of Lord Rayleigh in the 1880s. Nevertheless, a recent body of numerical and experimental evidence has shown that inhomogeneities in the ambient density distribution lead to much faster flows than arise in classical Rayleigh streaming. The emergence of these unusually strong flows creates new opportunities to enhance heat transfer in systems in which convective cooling cannot otherwise be easily achieved. To assess this possibility, a theoretical study of acoustic streaming in an ideal gas confined in a rectangular channel with top and bottom walls maintained at fixed but differing temperatures is performed. A two time scale system of equations is utilized to efficiently capture the coupling between the fast acoustic waves and the slowly evolving streaming flow, enabling strongly nonlinear regimes to be accessed. A large suite of numerical simulations is carried out to probe the streaming dynamics, to highlight the critical role played by baroclinically generated wave vorticity and to quantify the additional heat flux induced by the standing acoustic wave. Proper treatment of the two-way coupling between the waves and mean flow is found to be essential for convergence to a self-consistent steady state, and the variation of the resulting acoustically enhanced steady-state heat flux with both the amplitude of the acoustic wave and the O(1) aspect ratio of the channel is documented. For certain parameters, heat fluxes almost two orders of magnitude larger than those realizable by conduction alone can be attained.</description>

      <title>A meshless geometric conservation weighted least square method for solving the shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shallow water equations are numerically solved to simulate free surface flows. The convective flux terms in the shallow water equations need to be discretized using a Riemann solver to capture shocks and discontinuity for certain flow situations such as hydraulic jump, dam-break wave propagation or bore wave propagation, levee-breaching flows, etc. The approximate Riemann solver can capture shocks and is popular for studying open-channel flow dynamics with traditional mesh-based numerical methods. Though meshless methods can work on highly irregular geometry without involving the complex mesh generation procedure, the shock-capturing capability has not been implemented, especially for solving open-channel flows. Therefore, we have proposed a numerical method, namely, a shock-capturing meshless geometric conservation weighted least square (GC-WLS) method for solving the shallow water equations. The HLL (Harten-Lax-Van Leer) Riemann solver is implemented within the framework of the proposed meshless method. The spatial derivatives in the shallow water equations and the reconstruction of conservative variables for high-order accuracy are computed using the GC-WLS method. The proposed meshless method is tested for various numerically challenging open-channel flow problems, including analytical, laboratory experiments, and a large-scale physical model study on dam-break event.</description>

      <title>Evolution of vortex filaments and reconnections in the Gross-Pitaevski equation and its approximation by the binormal flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a vortex line following the binormal flow equation (i.e. with a velocity proportional to the local curvature in the direction of the binormal vector) has been postulated as an approximation for the evolution of vortex filaments in both the Euler system for inviscid incompressible fluids and the Gross-Pitaevski equation in superfluids. We address the issue of whether this is a suitable approximation or not and its degree of validity by using rigorous mathematical methods and direct numerical simulations. More specifically, we show that, as the vortex core thickness goes to zero, the vortex core moves (at leading order and for long periods of time) with a velocity proportional to its local curvature and the binormal vector to the curve. The main idea of our analysis lies in a reformulation of the Gross-Pitaevski equation in terms of associated velocity and vorticity fields that resemble the Euler system written in terms of vorticity in its weak form. We also present full numerical simulations aimed to compare Gross-Pitaevski and binormal flow in various physical situations of interest such as the periodic evolution of deformed vortex rings and the reconnection of vortex filaments.</description>

      <title>Divergence cleaning for weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a divergence cleaning formulation for the velocity in the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme. The proposed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning, ensures that the velocity divergence, $div(\mathbf{u})$, is minimised throughout the simulation. The divergence equation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation through a scalar field $\psi$. A parabolic term is added to the time-evolving divergence equation, resulting in a hyperbolic/parabolic form, dissipating acoustic waves with a speed of sound proportional to the local Mach number in order to maximise dissipation of the velocity divergence, preventing unwanted diffusion of the pressure field. The $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH algorithm is implemented in the open-source weakly compressible SPH solver DualSPHysics. The new formulation is validated against a range of challenging 2-D test cases including the Taylor-Green vortices, patch impact test, jet impinging on a surface, and wave impact in a sloshing tank. The results show that the new formulation reduces the divergence in the velocity field by at least one order of magnitude which prevents spurious numerical noise and the formation of unphysical voids. The temporal evolution of the impact pressures shows that the $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH formulation virtually eliminates unwanted acoustic pressure oscillations. Investigation of particle resolution confirms that the new $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH formulation does not reduce the spatial convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Investigation of rotational augmentation mechanisms on wind turbine blade sections based on Quasi-3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation has been recognized for its ability to decrease the extent of separate flow regions on the inner sections ofhorizontal-axis wind turbine blades. This alteration is often linked to centrifugal pumping. Nevertheless, studies focused on insect flight conditions revealed a significant contribution of the Coriolis acceleration to the balance of vorticity within the leading-edge vortex (LEV). Despite this insight, it remains unexplored whether this phenomenon contributes to the observed rotational augmentation in wind turbines. Our study employed quasi-3D simulations to delve into the impact of Coriolis acceleration on the balance of span-wise vorticity within the region of separate flow along the upper surface of wind turbine blade sections. Our results allowed the identification of two different mechanisms of rotational augmentation, one associated to the height reduction of the region of separate flow and the other associated to the stabilization of the LEV. The former occurred when a trailing-edge separation was observed and the later when the flow featured a leading-edge separation. Within the range of conditions considered, the Coriolis acceleration neutralized up to about 40% of the span-wise vorticity flowing in from the boundary layer to feed the LEV.</description>

      <title>A novel data-driven method for augmenting turbulence modeling for unsteady cavitating flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation is a highly turbulent, multi-phase flow phenomenon that manifests in the form of vapor cavities as a result of a sudden drop in the liquid pressure. The phenomenon has been observed as widely detrimental in hydraulic and marine applications like propellers and pumps, while also accelerating the sub-processes involved for bio-diesel production. Modelling cavitating flows has been extremely challenging owing to the resulting flow unsteadiness, phase transition and the cavitation-turbulence interaction. Standard methods to model turbulence like Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) and hybrid RANS-Large Eddy Simulations (LES) models are unable to reproduce the local turbulence dynamics observed in cavitating flow experiments. In an effort to facilitate the development of accurate RANS modelling procedures for cavitating flows, a data-driven approach devised by integrating Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) into a traditional RANS approach, without continuous RANS model feedback is proposed. The GEP algorithm is employed to obtain an additional corrective term, composed of flow variables derived directly from a baseline URANS cavitating flow calculation to be fit directly in the Boussinesq approximation. In addition, an optimizer based on the BFGS algorithm is employed on top of the GEP algorithm to ensure the solution is independent of the uncertainties associated with GEP. To evaluate the complexity of the model, we compare the approach with a more elementary linear regression technique. The GEP-CFD method is then used to train two expressions, for the Reynolds shear stress and the Turbulent Kinetic Energy simultaneously. The GEP-CFD approach is able to produce the flow features not captured by baseline RANS simulations in several areas, outperforming the RANS simulations and thus projects as a promising approach to augment numerical simulations for cavitating flows.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Parametric Airfoils to Study Geometric Effects on Buffet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research into buffet in the transonic flow regime has been focused on a limited number of proprietary airfoil geometries and has mainly considered parametric variations in Mach number and angle of attack. In contrast, relatively little is known about the sensitivity of buffet frequencies and amplitudes to geometric properties of airfoils. In the present contribution, an airfoil geometry construction method based on a small number of parameters is developed. The resulting airfoils and computational grids are high-order continuous everywhere except at the trailing edge corners. The effects of four key geometric parameters, defined by local extrema of coordinates on the airfoil at the design condition and denoted as 'crest' points, are studied using large-eddy simulation, considering both free-transitional and tripped boundary layers. For both states of the boundary layer, buffet amplitude and frequency are found to be highly sensitive to the axial and vertical position of the suction-side crest point, while the vertical crest position on the pressure side affects the mean lift. The present work confirms that buffet can appear for free-transitional (laminar buffet) and tripped conditions (turbulent buffet) with similar sensitivities. For test cases near onset conditions intermediate-frequency phenomena have been observed, which were linked to unsteadiness of separation bubbles. Frequencies scaling based on mean-flow properties of the separation bubble were shown to be in good agreement with previous findings on different airfoil geometries in Zauner et al. (Flow Turb. &amp; Comb., Vol. 110, 2023, pp. 1023-1057). Airfoil geometries are provided as open source: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12204411</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization of Non-Isothermal Sloshing in Microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sloshing of cryogenic liquid propellants can significantly impact a spacecraft's mission safety and performance by unpredictably altering the center of mass and producing large pressure fluctuations due to the increased heat and mass transfer within the tanks. This study, conducted as part of the NT-SPARGE (Non-isoThermal Sloshing PARabolic FliGht Experiment) project, provides a detailed experimental investigation of the thermodynamic evolution of a partially filled upright cylindrical tank undergoing non-isothermal sloshing in microgravity. Sloshing was induced by a step reduction in gravity during the 83rd European Space Agency (ESA) parabolic flight, resulting in a chaotic reorientation of the free surface under inertia-dominated conditions. To investigate the impact of heat and mass transfer on the sloshing dynamics, two identical test cells operating with a representative fluid, HFE-7000, in single-species were considered simultaneously. One cell was maintained in isothermal conditions, while the other started with initially thermally stratified conditions. Flow visualization, pressure, and temperature measurements were acquired for both cells. The results highlight the impact of thermal mixing on liquid dynamics coupled with the significant pressure and temperature fluctuations produced by the destratification. The comprehensive experimental data gathered provide a unique opportunity to validate numerical simulations and simplified models for non-isothermal sloshing in microgravity, thus contributing to improved cryogenic fluid management technologies.</description>

      <title>Freezing dynamics of wetting droplet under a uniform electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrofreezing is a powerful technique that employs the electric field to control and enhance the freezing process. In this work, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed to study the electrofreezing process of sessile droplet on a cooled substrate. The accuracy of the present LB method is first validated through performing some simulations of the three-phase Stefan problem, the droplet freezing on a cold wall, and the droplet deformation under a uniform electric field. Then it is used to investigate the effect of an electric field on the freezing of a wetting droplet on a cold substrate, and the numerical results show that the electric field has a significant influence on the freezing time of the droplet mainly through changing the morphology of the droplet. In particular, under the effect of the electric field, the freezing time is increased for the droplet with a prolate pattern, while the freezing time of the droplet with an oblate pattern is decreased. These numerical results bring some new insights on the electrofreezing and provide a valuable guidance for the precise regulation of droplet freezing.</description>

      <title>Does small-scale turbulence matter for ice growth in mixed-phase clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing the glaciation of mixed-phase clouds in terms of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process is a challenge for many weather and climate models, which tend to overestimate this process because cloud dynamics and microphysics are not accurately represented. As turbulence is essential for the transport of water vapour from evaporating liquid droplets to ice crystals, we developed a statistical model using established closures to assess the role of small-scale turbulence. The model successfully captures results of direct numerical simulations, and we use it to assess the role of small-scale turbulence. We find that small-scale turbulence broadens the droplet-size distribution somewhat, but it does not significantly affect the glaciation time on submetre scales. However, our analysis indicates that turbulence on larger spatial scales is likely to affect ice growth. While the model must be amended to describe larger scales, the present work facilitates a path forward to understanding the role of turbulence in the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of contaminant flow through porous media containing biochar adsorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence has shown green roof fertilizers released by higher intensity rainfalls contribute as a contaminant to local aquifers. To reduce this, biochar is used as an additive in green roof soil substrates as a fertilizer storage and dispersal regulatory aid. The evolution of contaminant transport and adsorption by biochar added to a packed bed is analyzed using experiments and simulations. Experiment 1 is used to determine the equilibrium capacity and adsorption rate of two types of biochar when immersed in a methylene blue solution. Breakthrough curves of a packed bed of glass beads with randomly interspersed biochar are determined in experiment 2. Simulations are then run to investigate the solute transport and adsorption dynamics at the pore-scale. An analytical model is proposed to capture the behavior of the biochar adsorption capacity and the simulation results are compared with experiment 2. A pore-scale analysis showed that uniformly sized beds are superior in contaminant breakthrough reduction, which is related to the adsorptive surface area and the rate at which adsorption capacity is reached. Cases using the adsorption capacity model display a tight distribution of particle surface concentration at later simulation times, indicating maximum possible adsorption. The beds with dissimilar particle sizes create more channeling effects which reduce adsorptive particle efficiency and consequently higher breakthrough concentration profiles. Comparison between experiments and simulations show good agreement. Improved biochar performance can be achieved by maintaining particle size uniformity alongside high adsorption capacity and adsorption rates appropriate to the rainfall intensity.</description>

      <title>Flexible floaters align with the direction of wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the slow, second order motion of thin flexible floating strips drifting in surface gravity waves. We introduce a diffractionless model (Froude-Krylov approximation) that neglects viscosity, surface tension, and radiation effects. This model predicts a mean yaw moment that favors a longitudinal orientation of the strip, along the direction of wave propagation, and a small reduction in the Stokes drift velocity. Laboratory experiments with thin rectangular strips of polypropylene show a systematic rotation of the strips towards the longitudinal position, in good agreement with our model. We finally observe that the mean angular velocity towards the stable longitudinal orientation decreases as the strip length increases, an effect likely due to dissipation, which is not accounted for in our inviscid model.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation in narrow gap spherical Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the spherical coordinates are solved using a pseudo-spectral method to simulate the problem of spherical Couette flow. The flow is investigated for a narrow gap ratio with only the inner sphere rotating. We find that the flow is sensitive to the initial conditions and have used various initial conditions to obtain di!erent branches of the bifurcation curve of the flow. We have identified three di!erent branches dominated respectively by axisymmetric flow, traveling wave instability, and equatorial instability. The axisymmetric branch shows unsteadiness at large Reynolds numbers. The traveling wave instability branch shows spiral instability and is prominent near poles. The traveling wave instability branch further exhibits a reversal in the propagation direction of the spiral instability as the Reynolds number is increased. This branch also exhibits a multi-mode equatorial instability at larger Reynolds numbers. The equatorial instability branch exhibits twin jet streams on either side of the equator, which becomes unstable at larger Reynolds numbers. The flow topology on the three branches are also investigated in their phase space and the found to exhibit a chaotic behavior at large Reynolds numbers on the traveling wave instability branch.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Dysthe equation for hydroelastic waves in a compressed ice sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear hydroelastic waves along a compressed ice sheet lying on top of a two-dimensional fluid of infinite depth are investigated. Based on a Hamiltonian formulation of this problem and by applying techniques from Hamiltonian perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian Dysthe equation is derived for the slowly varying envelope of modulated wavetrains. This derivation is further complicated here by the presence of cubic resonances for which a detailed analysis is given. A Birkhoff normal form transformation is introduced to eliminate non-resonant triads while accommodating resonant ones. It also provides a non-perturbative scheme to reconstruct the ice-sheet deformation from the wave envelope. Linear predictions on the modulational instability of Stokes waves in sea ice are established, and implications for the existence of solitary wavepackets are discussed for a range of values of ice compression relative to ice bending. This Dysthe equation is solved numerically to test these predictions. Its numerical solutions are compared to direct simulations of the full Euler system, and very good agreement is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex.</description>

      <title>Deformation of hydrogel during freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted experiments to directionally freeze agar hydrogel drops with different polymer concentrations, on a copper substrate maintained at low temperature. Unlike the water droplet studied in the literature, where the liquid part can reorganize during freezing, our droplets show a distinct deformation. This is due to the presence of the viscoelastic solid polymer matrix, which prevents deformation of the unfrozen part, leading mainly to elongation in the direction of the temperature gradient. We then derive a model describing this deformation. It assumes a flat freezing front, a change in volume at the front resulting from the Stefan condition, and a remaining volume to be frozen identical in shape to the initial one. The latter is in good agreement with experimental observations as long as water fluxes in the porous hydrogel remain negligible. It is also conclusive for different object shapes, as the hydrogel can be freely molded without a container.</description>

      <title>Unified mesoscale picture of nonlinear generation of zonal flows in toroidal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental findings on limit-cycle-oscillations indicate that the nonlinear driving of the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress to zonal flows is not a significant factor in the toroidal geometry, sparking fundamental controversial issues within the fusion community. By using the global nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a unified mesoscale picture of nonlinear driving of zonal flows in the ion-temperature-gradient turbulence. Zonal flows are nonlinearly driven by the turbulent energy flux and the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress. The turbulent energy flux is not shielded by the toroidal geometry effect in nonlinearly driving zonal flows. The turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress is not shielded on the time scale shorter than the ion bounce period; however, on the time scale longer than the ion bounce period, the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress is indeed shielded by the toroidal geometry effect.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of spheroids in Newtonian fluids with spatially varying viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the rigid body motion of a spheroid sedimenting in a Newtonian fluid with a spatially varying viscosity field. The fluid is at zero Reynolds number, and the viscosity varies linearly in space in an arbitrary direction with respect to the external force. First, we obtain the correction to the spheroid's rigid body motion in the limit of small viscosity gradients, using a perturbation expansion combined with the reciprocal theorem. Next, we determine the general form of the particle's mobility tensor relating its rigid body motion to an external force and torque. The viscosity gradient does not alter the force/translation and torque/rotation relationships, but introduces new force/rotation and torque/translation couplings that are determined for a wide range of particle aspect ratios. Finally, we discuss results for the spheroid's rotation and center-of-mass trajectory during sedimentation. Depending on the viscosity gradient direction and particle shape, a steady orientation may arise at long times or the particle may tumble continuously. These results are significantly different from the case when no viscosity gradient is present, where the particle stays at its initial orientation for all times. The particle's center of mass trajectory can also be altered depending on the particle's orientation behavior, for example giving rise to diagonal motion or zig-zagging motion. We summarize the observations for prolate and oblate spheroids for different viscosity gradient directions and provide phase plots delineating different dynamical regimes. We also provide guidelines to extend the analysis when the viscosity gradient exhibits a more complicated spatial behavior.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Models for Airfoil Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantage of providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions. We also evaluate an emerging generative modeling variant, flow matching, in comparison to regular diffusion models. The results demonstrate that flow matching addresses the problem of slow sampling speed typically associated with diffusion models. As such, it offers a promising new paradigm for uncertainty quantification with generative models.</description>

      <title>Rotational Taylor dispersion in linear flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between advection and diffusion in position space can often lead to enhanced mass transport compared to diffusion without flow. An important framework used to characterize the long-time diffusive transport in position space is the generalized Taylor dispersion theory. In contrast, the dynamics and transport in orientation space remains less developed. In this work, we develop a rotational Taylor dispersion theory that characterizes the long-time orientational transport of a spheroidal particle in linear flows that is constrained to rotate in the velocity-gradient plane. Similar to Taylor dispersion in position space, the orientational distribution of axisymmetric particles in linear flows at long times satisfies an effective advection-diffusion equation in orientation space. Using this framework, we then calculate the long-time average angular velocity and dispersion coefficient for both simple shear and extensional flows. Analytic expressions for the transport coefficients are derived in several asymptotic limits including nearly-spherical particles, weak flow, and strong flow. Our analysis shows that at long times the effective rotational dispersion is enhanced in simple shear and suppressed in extensional flow. The asymptotic solutions agree with full numerical solutions of the derived macrotransport equations and results from Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the interplay between flow-induced rotations and Brownian diffusion can fundamentally change the long-time transport dynamics.</description>

      <title>Linear stability and spectral modal decomposition of three-dimensional turbulent wake flow of a generic high-speed train</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the spatio-temporal evolution of coherentstructures in the wake of a high-speed train. SPOD is used to extract energy spectra and empirical modes for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of the fluctuating flow field. The spectrum of the symmetric component shows overall higher energy and more pronounced low-rank behavior compared to the antisymmetric one. The most dominant symmetric mode features periodic vortex shedding in the near wake, and wave-like structures in the far wake. The mode bispectrum further reveals the dominant role of self-interaction of the symmetric component, leading to first harmonic and subharmonic triads of the fundamental frequency, with remarkable deformation of the mean field. Then the stability of the three-dimensional wake flow is analyzed based on two-dimensional local linear stability analysis combined with a non-parallelism approximation approach. Temporal stability analysis is first performed, showing a more unstable condition in the near wake. The absolute frequency of the near-wake eigenmode is determined based on spatio-temporal analysis, then tracked along the streamwise direction to find out the global mode growth rate and frequency, which indicate a marginally stable global mode oscillating at a frequency close to the most dominant SPOD mode. The global mode wavemaker is then located, and the structural sensitivity is calculated based on the direct and adjoint modes derived from a local analysis, with the maximum value localized within the recirculation region close to the train tail. Finally, the global mode is computed by tracking the most spatially unstable eigenmode in the far wake, and the alignment with the SPOD mode is computed as a function of streamwise location. By combining data-driven and theoretical approaches, the mechanisms of coherentstructures in complex wake flows are well identified and isolated.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctorily neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. This force arises from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles and, since it depends on the particles' past history, complicates the dynamics by transforming their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. This study addresses the following question: Under what conditions can the Basset-Boussinesq force be neglected in light particles in geophysical flows? We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force is negligible when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particle's Stokes time. Interestingly, for most oceanic particles this force may be negligible. Only for very strong stratification, or for particles with very large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and foreseeable quantum hardware introduce noise into computations, requiring algorithms that make judicious use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Under these restrictions, variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. A classical device performs nonlinear computations, and a quantum one uses a variational solver for the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. Multigrid preconditioning of the Poisson problem helps avoid local minima and reduces resource requirements for the quantum device. A quantum state readout technique called HTree is used for the first time on a physical problem. Htree is appropriate for real-valued problems and achieves linear complexity in the qubit count, making the Navier-Stokes solve further tractable on current quantum devices. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Drag reduction in surfactant-contaminated superhydrophobic channels at high P\'eclet numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by microfluidic applications, we investigate drag reduction in laminar pressure-driven flows in channels with streamwise-periodic superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) that are contaminated with soluble surfactant. We develop a model in the long-wave and weak-diffusion limit, where the streamwise SHS period is large compared to the channel height and the P\'eclet number is large. Employing asymptotic and numerical techniques, we determine the drag due to surfactant in terms of the relative strength of advection, diffusion, Marangoni effects and bulk-surface partitioning and exchange. In scenarios with strong bulk-surface exchange, the drag reduction exhibits a complex dependence on the thickness of the bulk-concentration boundary layer and surfactant strength. Strong Marangoni effects immobilise the interface through a linear surfactant distribution, whereas weak Marangoni effects yield a quasi-stagnant cap. The quasi-stagnant cap distribution has an intricate asymptotic structure with an upstream slip region followed by intermediate inner regions and a quasi-stagnant region that is mediated by weak bulk diffusion. The quasi-stagnant region differs from the immobile region of a classical stagnant cap, observed for instance in surfactant-laden air bubbles in water, by displaying weak slip. As bulk-surface exchange weakens, the bulk and interface decouple: the surfactant distribution is linear when the surfactant is strong, whilst it forms a classical stagnant cap when the surfactant is weak. The asymptotic solutions offer closed-form predictions of drag reduction across much of the parameter space, providing practical utility and enhancing understanding of surfactant dynamics in flows over SHSs.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Surfactant-Laden Bubble Migration Dynamics in Self-Rewetting Fluids using Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs) (e.g., aqueous solutions of long-chain alcohols) show anomalous nonlinear (quadratic) variations of surface tension with temperature involving a positive gradient, leading to different thermocapillary convection compared to normal fluids (NFs). Moreover, surface-active materials or surfactants can significantly alter interfacial dynamics by their adsorption on fluid interfaces. The coupled effects of temperature- and surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses on migration bubbles in SRFs remain unexplored. We use a robust lattice Boltzmann (LB) method based on central moments to simulate the two-fluid motions, capture interfaces, and compute the transport of energy and surfactant concentration fields, and systematically study the surfactant-laden bubble dynamics in SRFs. When compared to motion of bubbles in normal fluids, in which they continuously migrate without a stationary behavior, our results show that they exhibit dramatically different characteristics in SRFs. Not only is the bubble motion directed towards the minimum temperature location in SRFs, but, more importantly, the bubble attains an equilibrium position. In the absence of surfactants, such an equilibrium position arises at the minimum reference temperature occurring at the center of the domain. The addition of surfactants moves the equilibrium location further upstream, which is controlled by the magnitude of the Gibbs elasticity parameter that determines the magnitude of the surface tension variation with surfactants. The quadratic sensitivity coefficient of surface tension on temperature associated with the SRF modulates this behavior. The lower this quantity, the greater is the role of surfactants modifying the equilibrium position of the bubble in SRF. These findings provide new means to potentially manipulate the bubble dynamics, and especially to tune its equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Airfoil Tonal Noise Reduction by Roughness Elements. Part II -- Direct Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a combined experimental and numerical effort we investigate airfoil tonal noise generation and reduction. The means of noise control are streak generators in form of cylindrical roughness elements. These elements are placed periodically along the span of airfoil at the mid chord streamwise position. Experiments are performed for a wide range of Reynolds number and angle of attack in a companion work (Alva et al. 2024). In the present work we concentrate on numerical investigations for a further investigation of selected cases. We have performed wall-resolved large-eddy simulations for a NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack and Mach 0.3. Two Reynolds numbers (80,000 and 100,000) have been investigated, showing acoustic results consistent with experiments at the same Reynolds but lower Mach numbers. Roughness elements attenuate tones in the acoustic field and, for the higher Reynolds number, suppress them. Through Fourier decomposition and spectral POD analysis of streamwise velocity data, dominating structures have been identified. Further, the coupling between structures generated by surface roughness and instability modes (Kelvin-Helmholtz) of shear layer has been identified through stability analysis, suggesting stabilisation mechanisms by which the sound generation by the airfoil is reduced by the roughness elements.</description>

      <title>Airfoil tonal noise reduction by roughness elements Part I -- Experimental investigation</title>

Abstract: Laminar separation bubbles around airfoils lead to the growth of instability waves, which enhances to acoustic scattering at the trailing-edge, forming a feedback loop that produces to tonal noise. To reduce the trailing-edge tonal noise, an array of roughness elements was used over a NACA0012 airfoil, at low angles of attack and moderate Reynolds number. Aeroacoustics and flow visualization experiments were performed for four configurations: a baseline smooth airfoil, two configurations with roughness elements on either airfoil surface (pressure side or suction side), and a fourth configuration with roughness elements at both airfoil surfaces. The roughness elements are made up of a row of spanwise periodically spaced cylinders, which were placed close to the mid-chord position. It is expected the proposed array of roughness elements stabilizes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism that is present on the separated shear layer through the induction of streak structures. The separation bubble is assessed using oil flow visualizations, and the cases with roughness elements show the generation of streaks downstream of the array cylinders, disrupting the separation bubble. Acoustic measurements results show a decrease, and in some cases the total suppression, of the tonal noise at Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.6$\times$10$^5$ to 2.5$\times$10$^5$, and angles of attack ranging from 0 to 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Mean field control of droplet dynamics with high order finite element computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid droplet dynamics are widely used in biological and engineering applications, which contain complex interfacial instabilities and pattern formation such as droplet merging, splitting, and transport. This paper studies a class of mean field control formulations for these droplet dynamics, which can be used to control and manipulate droplets in applications. We first formulate the droplet dynamics as gradient flows of free energies in modified optimal transport metrics with nonlinear mobilities. We then design an optimal control problem for these gradient flows. As an example, a lubrication equation for a thin volatile liquid film laden with an active suspension is developed, with control achieved through its activity field. Lastly, we apply the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm with high-order finite element methods to simulate the proposed mean field control problems. Numerical examples, including droplet formation, bead-up/spreading, transport, and merging/splitting on a two-dimensional spatial domain, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mean field control mechanism.</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation in elasto-capillary fluid-structure interaction systems involving three immiscible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we consider the elasto-capillary fluid-structure interaction problem studied in Bhopalam, Bueno &amp; Gomez (2022), i.e., three immiscible fluids in contact with an elastic solid. In this article, we show that the solution of this fluid-structure interaction problem satisfies an energy dissipation law.</description>
