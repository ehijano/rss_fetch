      <title>Density of integral points in the Betti moduli of quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a smooth quasi-projective complex variety equipped with a simple normal crossings compactification. We show that integral points are potentially dense in the (relative) character varieties parametrizing $SL_2$-local systems on $Y$ with fixed algebraic integer traces along the boundary components. The proof proceeds by using work of Corlette-Simpson to reduce to the case of Riemann surfaces, where we produce an integral point with Zariski-dense orbit under the mapping class group.</description>

      <title>Linkage of sheaves of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the works in linkage theory of modules, we define the concept of linkage of sheaves of modules as a generalization of linkage of modules. Thus, we expressed it in geometry algebraic language. We show that the linkedness of sheaves is a locally property. As an important result, we have shown that the sheaf of modules made of Glueing schemes and Glueing linked sheaves of modules is a linked sheaf. Also, it has been shown that for every sheaf of modules on non-domain, it is possible to obtain a maximal linked subsheaf of modules.</description>

      <title>Modeling Group Actions on Stacks (Especially the Lubin-Tate Action)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we are given a profinite group $G$ acting on a formal moduli stack $\mathcal{M}$, and we want to understand the group action, and compute cohomology related to this group action. How can we do it? This prolegomenon surveys two methods of pinning down such an action: geometric modeling and the two tower method. We highlight their use on a specific action - the automorphisms of a formal group acting on its deformation space, called the Lubin-Tate action.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series of second order jets of determinantal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will investigate the jet schemes of determinantal varieties. It is quite often the case that the geometric information concerning the jet schemes of an algebraic variety can be described, but the more refined algebraic information is quite mysterious. For example, it is known that computing the Hilbert function associated to a natural grading on these jet schemes is a very hard problem. The present paper handles a few such computations. It succeeds in computing the Hilbert functions of the second order jet schemes in the case of maximal minors of a $2\times n$ matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simplify and improve the main fundamental theorems of positive characteristic generic vanishing theory. As a quick corollary of the theory, we prove that a normal variety $X$ of maximal Albanese dimension satisfies $H^0(X, \omega_X) \neq 0$ and that if $\mathrm{Alb}(X)$ is ordinary, then $S^0(X, \omega_X) \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of maps to projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degenerations of linear series on smooth projective varieties approaching multicomponent varieties $X$ give rise to certain quiver representations in the category of linear series over $X$, which yield rational maps from $X$ to the corresponding quiver Grassmannians of codimension 1 subspaces. We describe these quiver Grassmannians for the case of the simplest quiver, arising when $X$ has only two components. We prove that they are reduced, local complete intersections whose components are rational of the same dimension. Also, we show that they are limits of projective spaces when they do arise from degenerations, and thus are special fibers of certain Mustafin varieties. Finally, we address a Riemann--Roch question for these quiver representations.</description>

      <title>Stacks, Monodromy and Symmetric Cubic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate monodromy groups arising in enumerative geometry, with a particular focus on how these groups are influenced by prescribed symmetries. To study these phenomena effectively, we work in the framework of moduli stacks rather than moduli spaces. This perspective proves broadly useful for understanding and constructing monodromy. We illustrate these ideas through several examples, with special attention to the 27 lines on a cubic surface, assuming the surface admits a given symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that irreducible Calabi-Yau varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a fibration by abelian varieties or primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed analytic deformation class, are birationally bounded. We prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a Lagrangian fibration. We also show that fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds are bounded. Conditional on the generalized abundance or hyperk\"ahler SYZ conjecture, our results prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of hyperk\"ahler varieties, of a fixed dimension, with $b_2 \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory levels in physics and math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the basics of a dictionary between Chern-Simons levels in three-dimensional gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) and the (coincidentally-named) Ruan-Zhang levels for twisted quantum K-theory in mathematics. Each defines a twisting of quantum K-theory, and our proposed dictionary identifies these two twistings, in the cases of projective spaces, Grassmannians, and flag manifolds. We verify the dictionary by realizing the Coulomb branch equations as symbols of certain differential operators annihilating a twisted version of the I function associated to the abelianized GLSM theory, and also by comparing the geometric window for Chern-Simons levels to an analogous window for the Ruan-Zhang levels. In the process, we interpret the geometric window for the Chern-Simons levels in terms of equalities of I and J functions. This provides a fuller mathematical understanding of some special cases in the physics literature. We also make conjectures for twisted quantum K-theory of gerbes, following up earlier conjectures on ordinary quantum K-theory of gerbes.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative resolutions and pre-quotients of Calabi-Yau double covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following an earlier proposal arXiv:2307.02038 to apply the GLSM formalism to understand the so-called non-commutative resolution, this paper takes one important step further to extend this formalism to a much larger class of non-commutative resolutions. The proposal was initially motivated by the discovery of a new class of mirror pairs singular Calabi-Yau varieties arXiv:2003.07148, given by certain branched double covers over toric varieties of MPCP type. The overarching problem was to understand these mirror pairs from the viewpoint of homological mirror symmetry arXiv:alg-geom/9411018. In the present paper, we propose two main results along this line. First, one new insight is that the `gauge-fixing' condition on the branching locus of the double cover used in arXiv:2003.07148 can be relaxed in an interesting way. This turns out to produce GLSMs that describe a much larger class of non-commutative resolutions, leading to $A$-periods for a larger class of non-commutative resolutions, as well as the GKZ systems for their $A$-periods. Second, we show that the $A$-periods can also be realized as $A$-periods of a certain smooth CICY family in a toric variety of MPCP type, such that a suitable finite quotient of this family recovers the double cover CY we have started with. We call this CICY family the `pre-quotient' of the double cover CY. This realization strongly suggests that pre-quotient may provide an important approach for understanding homological mirror symmetry for singular double cover CY varieties and non-commutative resolutions.</description>

      <title>A Lefschetz decomposition over $\mathbb Z$, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a 'Lefschetz filtration' of $\Lambda^*(\mathbb Z^{2g})$ and prove its subquotients are isomorphic as $\text{Sp}(2g)$-modules to primitive subspaces $P^k(\mathbb Z^{2g})$. This gives a sort of integral version of the Lefschetz decomposition over $\mathbb C$.
  We present three applications: the precise failure of the Hard Lefschetz theorem for $\Lambda^*(\mathbb Z^{2g})$, a description of the $\text{Sp}(2g)$-module structure on the cohomology of integer Heisenberg groups, and a computation of the Heegaard Floer homology groups $HF^\infty(\Sigma_g \times S^1; \mathbb Z)$ as modules over the mapping class group. Our computation implies that $HF^\infty$ is not naturally isomorphic to Mark's 'cup homology'.</description>

      <title>Density of algebraic points on products of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of density of algebraic points on surfaces. We give an effective asymptotic range in which the density degree set has regular behavior dictated by the index. By contrast, in small degree, the question of density is subtle and depends on the arithmetic of the curves. We give several explicit examples displaying these different behaviors, including products of genus $2$ curves with and without dense quadratic points. These results for products of curves have applications to questions about algebraic points on closely related surfaces, such as rank growth on abelian surfaces and bielliptic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Gushel-Mukai varieties are smooth complex dimensionally transverse intersections of a cone over the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(2,5)$ with a linear space and a quadratic hypersurface. The aim of this survey is to discuss the geometry, moduli, Hodge structures, and categorical aspects of these varieties. It is based on joint work with Alexander Kuznetsov and earlier work of Logachev, Iliev, Manivel, O'Grady, and others.</description>

      <title>Functorial resolution by torus actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and fast embedded resolution of varieties and principalization of ideals using torus actions on ambient smooth varieties with simple normal crossings (SNC) divisors. The canonical functorial resolution in characteristic zero is achieved via the newly introduced cobordant blow-ups along smooth weighted centers. These centers are defined by a geometric invariant measuring the singularities on smooth schemes with SNC divisors. The output is a smooth variety with a torus action and an SNC exceptional divisor. Its geometric quotient is birational to the resolved variety, has only abelian quotient singularities, and can be desingularized by purely combinatorial methods. The method is rooted in ideas from the joint work with Abramovich and Temkin and is closely related to McQuillan's resolution via stack-theoretic weighted blow-ups. As an application, we establish resolution results for certain classes of singularities in positive and mixed characteristic. This paper is a shortened and revised version of an earlier preprint.</description>

      <title>O-minimal geometry of higher Albanese manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. We study its higher Albanese manifolds, introduced by Hain and Zucker, from the point of view of o-minimal geometry. We show that for each $s$ the higher Albanese manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ can be functorially endowed with a structure of an $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable complex manifold in such a way that the natural projections $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{s-1}(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable and the higher Albanese maps $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{an}, \operatorname{exp}}$-definable. Suppose that for some $s \ge 3$ the definable manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is definably biholomorphic to a quasi-projective variety. We show that in this case the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step, i.e. the maps $\operatorname{Alb}^r (X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{r-1}(X)$ are isomorphisms for $r\ge 3$. It follows that if $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is dominant for some $s \ge 3$, then the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step and the pro-unipotent completion of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most 2-step nilpotent. This confirms a special case of a conjecture by Campana on nilpotent fundamental groups of algebraic varieties. As another application, we prove the existence and quasi-projectivity of unipotent Shafarevich reductions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a period map defined over a quasi-projective variety, we construct a completion with rich geometric and Hodge-theoretic meaning. This result may be regarded as an analog of Mumford's toroidal compactification for locally symmetric Hodge varieties as well as a realizable alternative of Kato--Nakayama--Usui's construction. As an application, we give an alternative proof on the algebraicity of weakly special subvarieties.</description>

Abstract: Whitney's extension problem, i.e., how one can tell whether a function $f : X \to \mathbb R$, $X \subseteq \mathbb R^n$, is the restriction of a $C^m$-function on $\mathbb R^n$, was solved in full generality by Charles Fefferman in 2006. In this paper, we settle the $C^{1,\omega}$-case of a related conjecture: given that $f$ is semialgebraic and $\omega$ is a semialgebraic modulus of continuity, if $f$ is the restriction of a $C^{1,\omega}$-function then it is the restriction of a semialgebraic $C^{1,\omega}$-function. We work in the more general setting of sets that are definable in an o-minimial expansion of the real field. An ingenious argument of Brudnyi and Shvartsman relates the existence of $C^{1,\omega}$-extensions to the existence of Lipschitz selections of certain affine-set valued maps. We show that if a definable affine-set valued map has Lipschitz selections then it also has definable Lipschitz selections. In particular, we obtain a Lipschitz solution (more generally, $\omega$-H\"older solution, for any definable modulus of continuity $\omega$) of the definable Brenner-Epstein-Hochster-Koll\'ar problem. In most of our results we have control over the respective (semi)norms.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>

Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Gradings on nilpotent Lie algebras associated with the nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>
