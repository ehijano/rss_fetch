      <title>Dynamical Analysis Of Fractional Order Generalized Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a generalization to the classical logistic map. The generalized map preserves most properties of the classical map and has richer dynamics as it contains the fractional order and one more parameter. We propose the stability bounds for each equilibrium point. The detailed bifurcation analysis with respect to both parameters is presented using the bifurcation diagrams in one and two dimensions. The chaos in this system is controlled using delayed feedback. We provide some non-linear feedback controllers to synchronize the system. The multistability in the proposed system is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Estimating neural connection strengths from firing intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a procedure for using a standard activity-based neuron network model and firing data to compute the effective connection strengths between neurons in a network. We assume a Heaviside response function, that the external inputs are given and that the initial state of the neural activity is known. The associated forward operator for this problem, which maps given connection strengths to the time intervals of firing, is highly nonlinear. Nevertheless, it turns out that the inverse problem of determining the connection strengths can be solved in a rather transparent manner, only employing standard mathematical tools. In fact, it is sufficient to solve a system of decoupled ODEs, which yields a linear system of algebraic equations for determining the connection strengths. The nature of the inverse problem is investigated by studying some mathematical properties of the aforementioned linear system and by a series of numerical experiments. Finally, under an assumption preventing the effective contribution of the network to each neuron from staying at zero, we prove that the involved forward operator is continuous. Sufficient criteria on the external input ensuring that the needed assumption holds are also provided.</description>

      <title>Three characterizations of a self-similar aperiodic 2-dimensional subshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to illustrate a generalization of the Fibonacci word to the case of 2-dimensional configurations on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. More precisely, we consider a particular subshift of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$ on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}=\{0,\dots,15\}$ for which we give three characterizations: as the subshift $\mathcal{X}_\Phi$ generated by a 2-dimensional morphism $\Phi$ defined on $\mathcal{A}$; as the Wang shift $\Omega_\mathcal{Z}$ defined by a set $\mathcal{Z}$ of 16 Wang tiles; as the symbolic dynamical system $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z},R_\mathcal{Z}}$ representing the orbits under some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action $R_\mathcal{Z}$ defined by rotations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and coded by some topological partition $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z}$ of $\mathbb{T}^2$ into 16 polygonal atoms. We prove their equality $\Omega_\mathcal{Z} =\mathcal{X}_\Phi=\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z},R_\mathcal{Z}}$ by showing they are self-similar with respect to the substitution $\Phi$.
  This chapter provides a transversal reading of results divided into four different articles obtained through the study of the Jeandel-Rao Wang shift. It gathers in one place the methods introduced to desubstitute Wang shifts and to desubstitute codings of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions by focussing on a simple 2-dimensional self-similar subshift. SageMath code to find marker tiles and compute the Rauzy induction of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotations is provided allowing to reproduce the computations. The chapter contains many exercises whose solutions are provided at the end.</description>

      <title>On an abrasion motivated fractal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fractal model motivated by the abrasion of convex polyhedra, where the abrasion is realised by chipping small neighbourhoods of vertices. After providing a formal description of the successive chippings, we show that the net of edges converge to a compact limit set under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we study the upper box-counting dimension and the Hausdorff dimension of the limiting object of the net of edges after infinitely many chipping.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of the Sterile Insect Technique in the presence of inaccessible areas: A study using two-patch models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is one of the sustainable strategies for the control of disease vectors, which consists of releasing sterilized males that will mate with the wild females, resulting in a reduction and, eventually a local elimination, of the wild population. The implementation of the SIT in the field can become problematic when there are inaccessible areas where the release of sterile insects cannot be carried out directly, and the migration of wild insects from these areas to the treated zone may influence the efficacy of this technique. However, we can also take advantage of the movement of sterile individuals to control the wild population in these unreachable places. In this paper, we derive a two-patch model for Aedes mosquitoes where we consider the discrete diffusion between the treated area and the inaccessible zone. We investigate two different release strategies (constant and impulsive periodic releases), and by using the monotonicity of the model, we show that if the number of released sterile males exceeds some threshold, the technique succeeds in driving the whole population in both areas to extinction. This threshold depends on not only the biological parameters of the population but also the diffusion between the two patches.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic nonuniform hyperbolicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples of continuous $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles which are not uniformly hyperbolic despite having the same non-zero Lyapunov exponents with respect to all invariant measures. The base dynamics can be any non-trivial subshift of finite type. According to a theorem of DeWitt--Gogolev and Guysinsky, such cocycles cannot be H\"older-continuous. Our construction uses the nonuniformly hyperbolic cocycles discovered by Walters in 1984.</description>

Abstract: We show that given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$, and projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, cut-and-project sets obtained using Jordan measurable windows $W$ and $W'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of equal measure are bounded distance equivalent only if $W$ and $W'$ are equidecomposable by translations in $p_2(\Gamma)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the bounded distance equivalence classes in the hulls of simple quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent provably escapes saddle points in the training of shallow ReLU networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems theory has recently been applied in optimization to prove that gradient descent algorithms bypass so-called strict saddle points of the loss function. However, in many modern machine learning applications, the required regularity conditions are not satisfied. In this paper, we prove a variant of the relevant dynamical systems result, a center-stable manifold theorem, in which we relax some of the regularity requirements. We explore its relevance for various machine learning tasks, with a particular focus on shallow rectified linear unit (ReLU) and leaky ReLU networks with scalar input. Building on a detailed examination of critical points of the square integral loss function for shallow ReLU and leaky ReLU networks relative to an affine target function, we show that gradient descent circumvents most saddle points. Furthermore, we prove convergence to global minima under favourable initialization conditions, quantified by an explicit threshold on the limiting loss.</description>

      <title>Neural Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15190v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear operators with long distance spatiotemporal dependencies are fundamental in modeling complex systems across sciences, yet learning these nonlocal operators remains challenging in machine learning. Integral equations (IEs), which model such nonlocal systems, have wide ranging applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. We introduce Neural Integral Equations (NIE), a method for learning unknown integral operators from data using an IE solver. To improve scalability and model capacity, we also present Attentional Neural Integral Equations (ANIE), which replaces the integral with self-attention. Both models are grounded in the theory of second kind integral equations, where the indeterminate appears both inside and outside the integral operator. We provide theoretical analysis showing how self-attention can approximate integral operators under mild regularity assumptions, further deepening previously reported connections between transformers and integration, and deriving corresponding approximation results for integral operators. Through numerical benchmarks on synthetic and real world data, including Lotka-Volterra, Navier-Stokes, and Burgers' equations, as well as brain dynamics and integral equations, we showcase the models' capabilities and their ability to derive interpretable dynamics embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that ANIE outperforms existing methods, especially for longer time intervals and higher dimensional problems. Our work addresses a critical gap in machine learning for nonlocal operators and offers a powerful tool for studying unknown complex systems with long range dependencies.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated vehicle platooning, where the platoon followers communicate solely with the platoon leader. A dynamic model is proposed to account for driving safety under communication delays. General linear stability results are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the impact of model parameters in two scenarios: a ring road with initial disturbance and an infinite road with periodic disturbance. The simulation outcomes align with the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed "look-to-the-leader" platooning strategy significantly outperforms conventional car-following strategies, such as following one or two vehicles ahead, in terms of traffic flow stabilization. This paper introduces a new perspective on organizing platoons for autonomous vehicles, with implications for enhancing traffic stability.</description>
