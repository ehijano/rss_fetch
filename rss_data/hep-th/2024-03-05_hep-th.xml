      <title>Positivity of the Hypergeometric Coon Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize a novel method for the partial-wave unitarity recently suggested in [1] to analyse the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. In this approach we use a new type of harmonic numbers as a basis. Owing to the properties of the harmonic numbers this method bypasses lots of difficulties and can be used to derive a clear and unified form for the partial-wave coefficients. This new approach further streamlines the partial-wave unitarity analysis. As an instance, we re-derive the unitarity bounds from Regge trajectory analysis and find the new critical condition of the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. Our new method also benefits the discussion on the various limits of this amplitude. Specifically, we demonstrate the manifest positivity of super string below $d\leq10$ from our new perspective.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>On Democratic String Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reexamine democratic open string field theories, namely, theories in which string fields are not constrained to a single picture number and picture changing is obtained as a gauge transformation. We describe several possibilities for regular free theories and attempt to construct the lowest order interaction term and identify the lowest order gauge transformation for some of these theories. We also discuss projections over string field spaces that might be needed for a consistent off-shell implementation of picture changing.</description>

      <title>New supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $N=(1,1)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries. By considering a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant sector, we find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing a topological twist along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ and a Kahler four-cycle, the twist is implemented by $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge field while, for $\mathcal{M}_4$ given by a Clayley four-cycle, the twist is performed by turning on $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge fields. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacua. Among these solutions, there are solutions interpolating between both of the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua and near horizon geometries. The solutions can also be interpreted as holographic RG flows from five-dimensional SCFTs to superconformal quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On duality of four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Seiberg-like duality of $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory coupled with tensor chiral fields and fundamental chiral fields works if the meson spectrum built from the tensor fields takes particular form: a) It should be truncated; b) The $R$ charges of tensor fields $\{R_a\}$ and the truncated mesons $\{R_j\}$ take very special values. The meson spectrum so that the duality works is encoded elegantly in the factorization of the polynomial $y^n-1=\Phi_{+}\Phi_{-}$. Our consideration covers many known $\mathcal{N}=1$ dualities and generates a large class of new examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry in Dynamical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore generalized symmetry in the context of nonlinear dynamical gravity. Our basic strategy is to transcribe known results from Yang-Mills theory directly to gravity via the tetrad formalism, which recasts general relativity as a gauge theory of the local Lorentz group. By analogy, we deduce that gravity exhibits a one-form symmetry implemented by an operator $U_\alpha$ labeled by a center element $\alpha$ of the Lorentz group and associated with a certain area measured in Planck units. The corresponding charged line operator $W_\rho$ is the holonomy in a spin representation $\rho$, which is the gravitational analog of a Wilson loop. The topological linking of $U_\alpha$ and $W_\rho$ has an elegant physical interpretation from classical gravitation: the former materializes an exotic chiral cosmic string defect whose quantized conical deficit angle is measured by the latter. We verify this claim explicitly in an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. Notably, our conclusions imply that the standard model exhibits a new symmetry of nature at scales below the lightest neutrino mass. More generally, the absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity suggests that the gravitational one-form symmetry is either gauged or explicitly broken. The latter mandates the existence of fermions. Finally, we comment on generalizations to magnetic higher-form or higher-group gravitational symmetries.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic Conformal Field Theory in Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-relativistic conformal field theory describes many-body physics at unitarity. The correlation functions of the system are fixed by the requirement of conformal invariance. In this article, we discuss the correlation functions of scalar operators in non-relativistic conformal field theories in momentum space. We discuss the solution of conformal Ward identities and express 2,3, and 4-point functions as a function of energy and momentum. We also express the 3- and 4-point functions in the momentum space as the one-loop and three-loop Feynman diagram computations, respectively.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Integrability in Double Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at a critical point.</description>

      <title>Carroll Strings with an Extended Symmetry Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Polyakov action we consider two distinct Carroll limits in target space, keeping the string worldsheet relativistic. The resulting magnetic and chiral Carroll string models exhibit different symmetries and dynamics. Both models have an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra with Carroll symmetry included in a finite dimensional subalgebra. For the magnetic model, this is the so-called string Carroll algebra. The chiral model realises an extended version of the string Carroll algebra. The magnetic model does not have any transverse string excitations. The chiral model is less restrictive and includes arbitrary left-moving modes that carry transverse momentum but do not contribute to the energy in target space.</description>

      <title>Global shift symmetry on ADM hypersurface: Towards emergent "gravity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries and their spontaneous breakdown serve as the fundamental concept to constrain the many-body entanglement structure, which allows us to characterize quantum phases of matter and emergent collective excitations. For example, emergent photons may be understood by spontaneous 1-form symmetry breaking, which results from a long-ranged entanglement structure between UV microscopic degrees of freedom. In this study, we show that emergent ``gravity" may also arise in a similar fashion, where ``" has been used to emphasize that the symmetry-constrained gravitons show unconventional properties compared to usual gravitons. As the electric 1-form symmetry in Maxwell theory is realized as a global shift symmetry of the spatial component of the U(1) gauge field, generated by the electric field, we demonstrate that a constant shift of the ADM metric on the spatial hypersurface can be viewed as a global symmetry, generated by the ADM canonical momentum. Deriving a vector-type conserved charge from the variation of action, we construct a shift symmetry operator. Considering a Wick rotation, we demonstrate that a gravitational Wilson loop is charged under the action of this shift symmetry operator, which thus confirms the existence of a generalized global symmetry on the ADM hypersurface. Based on the Ward identity, we show that the spontaneous breaking of this global shift symmetry may give rise to a non-propagating massless symmetric gauge field at the boundary of the hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical saddles of three-dimensional gravity via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find out the complex geometries corresponding to the semi-classical saddles of threedimensional quantum gravity by making use of the known results of dual conformal field theory (CFT), which is effectively given by Liouville field theory. We examine both the cases with positive and negative cosmological constants. We determine the set of semi-classical saddles to choose from the homotopy argument in the Chern-Simons formulation combined with CFT results and provide strong supports from the mini-superspace approach to the quantum gravity. For the case of positive cosmological constant, partial results were already obtained in our previous works, and they are consistent with the current ones. For the case of negative cosmological constant, we identify the geometry corresponding a semi-classical saddle with three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space dressed with imaginary radius three-dimensional spheres. The geometry is generically unphysical, but we argue that the fact itself does not lead to any problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilaton and axion are ubiquitous in extended supergravities and closed superstrings. We propose new models of modular inflation in four-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to the chiral dilaton-axion-goldstino supermultiplet, which fit some necessary conditions of superstring cosmology. The model parameters are tuned to obey precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. We employ the modular-invariant superpotentials and asymptotically modular-invariant K\"ahler potentials, and achieve axion stabilization with high-scale supersymmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Non equivalence of Carroll limits in relativistic string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new Carroll strings in flat space by considering the Carroll limit of equivalent relativistic string theories at classical level. In the limit these Carroll strings are no longer equivalent and have different degrees of freedom. This fact is due to a general phenomenon that the configuration space and canonical Lagrangians are no longer equivalent after a singular redefinition of the variables and of the parameters of the starting Lagrangians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a method for calculating holographic duals of BCFTs with more than two boundaries. We apply it to calculating the dynamics of entanglement entropy in a 1+1d CFT that is instantaneously split into multiple segments and calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for the case of two splits, showing that our approach reproduces earlier results for the double split case. Our manuscript lays the groundwork for future calculations of the entanglement entropy for more than two splits and systems at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamical $r$-matrices for the Chern-Simons formulation of generalised 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical dynamical $r$-matrices arise naturally in the combinatorial description of the phase space of Chern-Simons theories, either through the inclusion of dynamical sources or through a gauge-fixing procedure involving two punctures. Here we consider classical dynamical $r$-matrices for the family of Lie algebras which arise in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3d gravity, for any value of the cosmological constant. We derive differential equations for classical dynamical $r$-matrices in this case, and show that they can be viewed as generalised complexifications, in a sense which we define, of the equations governing dynamical $r$-matrices for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We obtain explicit families of solutions and relate them, via Weierstrass factorisation, to solutions found by Feher, Gabor, Marshall, Palla and Pusztai in the context of chiral WZWN models.</description>

      <title>Fractional Spins, Unfolding, and Holography: I. Parent field equations for dual higher-spin gravity reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work and in a companion paper we initiate an approach to holography based on the AKSZ formalism. As a first step, we refine Vasiliev's holography proposal in arXiv:1203.5554 by obtaining 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal higher-spin gravity (CCHSG) -- i.e., coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields -- as two distinct and classically consistent reductions of a single parent theory. The latter consists, on-shell, of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. The 4D HSG and 3D CCHSG reductions are characterized by dual structure groups and two-form cohomology elements, and their embedding in a common parent model provides a rationale for deriving holographic relations from multi-dimensional AKSZ partition functions on cylinders with dual boundary conditions, to appear separately. In this work we i) construct the underlying non-commutative geometry as a metaplectic operator algebra represented in a Hermitian module of a pair of conformal particles; ii) identify a discrete modular group, arising from twisted boundary conditions of the first-quantized system, and connecting different boundary conditions of the second-quantized system; and iii) identify the holonomies, structure groups and two-form cohomology elements that characterize the HSG and CCHSG reductions, and equate the dual second Chern classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper completes the analysis initiated in a companion work -- referred to as Paper I -- by showing how 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields (coloured conformal HSG, or CCHSG) emerge as consistent reductions of a common parent model. The latter is a Frobenius-Chern-Simons model with superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra, and was defined and studied in Paper I. Here, we i) realize HSG as a subcase of a more general 4D reduction, describing HSG coupled to coloured, fractional-spin matter, which we refer to as 4D fractional-spin gravity; ii) study the CCHSG model, in particular exhibiting the crucial role played by novel colour gauge fields in coupling conformal matter to conformal HSG, thereby completing the perturbatively defined models of conformal HSG due to Vasiliev and Nilsson; iii) extract conformal currents and composite coloured sources in an expansion of the CCHSG model around 3D Minkowskian leaves; and iv) compare our results with Vasiliev's holography proposal of arXiv:1203.5554. The common origin of HSG and CCHSG, besides relating the two models directly, is also the starting point for establishing the holographic correspondence between the two models via overlap conditions, to be presented separately.</description>

Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <title>Reclaiming the Lost Conformality in a non-Hermitian Quantum 5-state Potts Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal symmetry, emerging at critical points, can be lost when renormalization group fixed points collide. Recently, it was proposed that after collisions, real fixed points transition into the complex plane, becoming complex fixed points described by complex conformal field theories (CFTs). Although this idea is compelling, directly demonstrating such complex conformal fixed points in microscopic models remains highly demanding. Furthermore, these concrete models are instrumental in unraveling the mysteries of complex CFTs and illuminating a variety of intriguing physical problems, including weakly first-order transitions in statistical mechanics and the conformal window of gauge theories. In this work, we have successfully addressed this complex challenge for the (1+1)-dimensional quantum $5$-state Potts model, whose phase transition has long been known to be weakly first-order. By adding an additional non-Hermitian interaction, we successfully identify two conjugate critical points located in the complex parameter space, where the lost conformality is restored in a complex manner. Specifically, we unambiguously demonstrate the radial quantization of the complex CFTs and compute the operator spectrum, as well as new operator product expansion coefficients that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsic gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Study of charged gravastar model in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent days gravastar has been a very lucrative alternative to black holes, as it does not suffer from the singularity problem as well and it is based on sound physical grounds. Modified Symmetric teleparallel equivalent of gravity also has seen quite a few successes in recent years both in cosmology as well as in astrophysical objects like black holes and wormholes. In this paper, we have considered the charged gravastar in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ formulation and have solved it fully analytically and found various physical characteristics like energy density, entropy and EoS for the gravastar. We have used the Israel junction condition to make some phenomenological predictions regarding the potential of the thin shell around the gravastar. We have also studied the deflection of the angle caused by the gravastar. Finally, we conclude by noting how future radio telescopes could detect the gravastar shadow and how can one distinguish it from the black hole event horizon.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

Abstract: In this thesis, we scrutinize the literature to trace the evolution of the concepts surrounding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and the attempts to prove or disprove it. We discuss its development over the years, its conceptual transformations, and the various thought experiments constructed to validate or invalidate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We also discuss possible connections with blackhole thermodynamics, and end with an evaluation of the current status about the subject, and finally, speculations about the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, I studied the thermodynamical properties of the Einstein-Maxwell system with a box boundary in 4-dimensions [1](arXiv:2402.16113). In this paper, I investigate those in 3-dimensions. Similar to the 4-dimensional case, the system is thermodynamically well-behaved when $\Lambda&lt;0$ (due to the contribution of the ``bag of gold'' saddles). However, when $\Lambda=0$, a crucial difference to the 4-dimensional case appears, i.e. the 3-dimensional system turns out to be thermodynamically unstable, while the 4-dimensional one is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the arbitrary dimensional FRW universe: Joule-Thomson expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

Abstract: We investigate whether inflation in the early universe can be induced by an extra component of a five-dimensional ${\rm U(1)}$ gauge field in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime or not. We show that an effective potential obtained by quantum corrections can act as an inflaton potential by finding parameter regions consistent with Planck 2018 results. In our model, fields involved in inflation obey a different type of boundary condition from that of the visible particles, and a surviving Wilson line phase can play a specific role for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

Abstract: We examine perturbations of a massive scalar field around spherically symmetric, brane-localized black holes. Although the ringdown and asymptotic tails of various brane-world black holes have been extensively studied, there has been no analysis of the massive late-time tails for the simplest Schwarzschild-like, brane-localized black hole to date. We demonstrate that after the ringdown phase, two stages of oscillatory tails emerge - intermediate and asymptotic. The asymptotic decay law is distinct from those associated with Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom solutions.</description>

      <title>De Sitter horizon entropy from a simplicial Lorentzian path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dimension of the Hilbert space of a quantum gravitational system can be written formally as a path integral partition function over Lorentzian metrics. We implement this in a 2+1 dimensional simplicial minisuperspace model in which the system is a spatial topological disc, and recover by contour deformation through a Euclidean saddle the entropy of the de Sitter static patch, up to discretization artifacts. The model illustrates the importance of integration over both positive and negative lapse to enforce the gravitational constraints, and of restriction to complex metrics for which the fluctuation integrals would converge. Although a strictly Lorentzian path integral is oscillatory, an exponentially large partition function results from unavoidable imaginary contributions to the action. These arise from analytic continuation of the simplicial (Regge) action for configurations with codimension-2 simplices where the metric fails to be Lorentzian. In particular, the dominant contribution comes from configurations with contractible closed timelike curves that encircle the boundary of the disc, in close correspondence with recent continuum results.</description>

      <title>Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper points out that, in a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, the four coordinates of any point may be viewed as arising from five homogeneous coordinates according to the well-established recipes of projective geometry. Moreover, if the homogeneous coordinates change by a linear transformation, ruled by the coefficients of a matrix of the group GL(5,R), this induces a fractional linear transformation of spherically symmetric spacetime coordinates which can be exploited to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. For the single points, the underlying structure is a projective map which destroys the 2-sphere, whereas the two products of a half-line with the 2-sphere arise from a projective map which preserves the 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai and de Sitter spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai and de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of magnetized quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the framework of magneto-hydrodynamics is the focus of our study. We are investigating the temporal and spatial evolution of QGP using a second order viscous hydrodynamic framework. The fluid is considered to be magnetized and subjected to the influence of a magnetic field that is generated during the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions.We assume boost invariance along the beam line, which is represented by the $z$ coordinate, and fluid expansion in the $x$ direction. Additionally, we assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the reaction plane, which corresponds to the $y$ direction. The fluid is considered to have infinite electrical conductivity. To analyze this system, we solve the coupled Maxwell and conservation equations. By doing so, we are able to determine the time and space dependence of the energy density, velocity, and magnetic field in the transverse plane of the viscous magnetized hot plasma. Furthermore, we obtain the spectrum of hadrons and compare it with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold Quark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential $\mu_\text{B}$. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential. Using this approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold and dense quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using the M\"obius-redefined time. It can either interchange two different vacuum waves transforming a global one into a sandwich vacuum wave, or transform the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, interchanges the symmetries and the geodesics. The second type, inspired by molecular physics, is illustrated by an anisotropic generalization of the familiar inverse-square profile with its familiar conformal O(2,1) symmetry. The particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuations and numerical evaluation of the Appell $F_1$, $F_3$, Lauricella $F_D^{(3)}$ and Lauricella-Saran $F_S^{(3)}$ and their Application to Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our investigation of the study of two variable hypergeometric series, namely Appell $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$ series, and obtain a comprehensive list of its analytic continuations enough to cover the whole real $(x,y)$ plane, except on their singular loci. We also derive analytic continuations of their 3-variable generalization, the Lauricella $F_{D}^{(3)}$ series and the Lauricella-Saran $F_{S}^{(3)}$ series, leveraging the analytic continuations of $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$, which ensures that the whole real $(x,y,z)$ space is covered, except on the singular loci of these functions. While these studies are motivated by the frequent occurrence of these multivariable hypergeometric functions in Feynman integral evaluation, they can also be used whenever they appear in other branches of mathematical physics. To facilitate their practical use, we provide four packages: $\texttt{AppellF1.wl}$, $\texttt{AppellF3.wl}$, $\texttt{LauricellaFD.wl}$, and $\texttt{LauricellaSaranFS.wl}$ in $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$. These packages are applicable for generic as well as non-generic values of parameters, keeping in mind their utilities in the evaluation of the Feynman integrals. We explicitly present various physical applications of these packages in the context of Feynman integral evaluation and compare the results using other means as well. Various $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$ notebooks demonstrating different numerical results are also provided along with this paper.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in two-dimensional metals at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the undisputed signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We propose a construction to compute the holographic entanglement negativity for bipartite mixed state configurations of two disjoint subsystems in higher dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_d$s) dual to bulk AdS$_{d+1}$ geometries. Our proposal follows from the corresponding AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ scenario and involves an algebraic sum of the areas of bulk RT surfaces for certain combinations of subsystems. Utilizing our construction we compute the holographic entanglement negativity at the leading order through a perturbative expansion, for such bipartite mixed states of two disjoint subsystems with long rectangular strip geometries in CFT$_d$s dual to bulk pure AdS$_{d+1}$ geometries and AdS$_{d+1}$-Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in scattering amplitudes have exposed previously-hidden color-kinematics and double-copy structures in theories ranging from gauge and gravity theories to effective field theories such as chiral perturbation theory and the Born-Infeld model. These novel structures both simplify higher-order calculations and pose tantalizing questions related to a unified framework underlying relativistic quantum theories. This introductory mini-review article invites further exploration of these topics. After a brief introduction to color-kinematics duality and the double copy as they emerges at tree and loop-level in gauge and gravity theories, we present two distinct examples: 1) an introduction to the web of double-copy-constructible theories, and 2) a discussion on the application of the double copy to calculation relevant to gravitational-wave physics.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the self-interactions of a massive spin-2 "graviton" consistent with up to $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry. Using a recently developed massive on-shell superspace formalism, we construct the most general set of cubic massive graviton amplitudes in a form with all supersymmetry and Lorentz invariance manifest. We find that for $\mathcal{N}\geq 3$ supersymmetry, the family of consistent interactions coincide with those of the ghost-free dRGT model. For $\mathcal{N}=4$ (maximal) supersymmetry there is a single consistent cubic interaction which coincides with the unique structure required for the absence of asymptotic superluminality. Additionally, we discuss the structure of interactions in the high-energy limit, connections to supersymmetric Galileons and the possibility of a supersymmetric massive double copy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the corrected thermodynamics and naked singularity structure of the topological static spherically symmetric solution in $\mathcal{F}(R,\mathcal{G})$ - gravity coupled with Born-Infeld - like nonlinear electrodynamics. Solutions admitting black holes with constant topological Euler density is analyzed in view of various thermodynamical variables. The inclusion of logarithmic correction to the entropy is extended to the other thermodynamical variables and the contribution of corrected variables are displayed on various plots. The stability of black hole under the effect of thermal variables is also studied. As a second scope of this study, solutions admitting timelike naked singularity are probed with bosonic and fermionic quantum wave packets to see if the singularity is quantum mechanically regular or not. In this context, the evolution of these probes remains well-defined if the corresponding spatial Hamiltonian operator is essentially self-adjoint. Our calculations reveal that when the singularity is probed with specific wave modes involving spin - $0$ and spin - $1/2$ quantum wave packets, the corresponding wave operators turn out to be essentially self-adjoint, which in turn implies unique well-defined time evolution.</description>

      <title>Q-ball-like solitons on the M2-brane with worldvolume fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a family of analytic solutions to the nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the dynamics of the bosonic part of the mass operator of a M2-brane compactified on $M_9\times T^2$ in the LCG with worldvolume fluxes. Those fluxes can be induced by a constant and quantized supergravity 3-form. This sector of the theory, at supersymmetric level, has the interesting property of having a discrete spectrum. We have focused on the characterization of Q-ball-like (QBL) solitons on the M2-brane with worldvolume fluxes. Two scenarios are analysed: one in which the system is isotropic and the other anisotropic. In the isotropic case, we obtain analytic families of string-like solutions to the membrane equations of motion in the presence of a non-vanishing symplectic gauge field that satisfy all constraints. We explicitly show a localised family of QBL solutions. It is demonstrated that although the solutions generally exhibit dispersion, they also allow for dispersion-free solutions. In the non-isotropic case, we obtain full-fledged membrane QBL solutions by numerical methods. We characterize some other properties of the solutions found. The dynamics of the QBL solutions are also encountered. We analyze the Lorentz boosts and Galilean transformations. Since we work in the Light Cone Gauge, the Lorentz transformed solutions are not automatically solutions, rather some extra conditions must be imposed. Only a subset of the solutions remain. We discuss some examples. The QBL solitons of the M2-brane that have been discovered contain an interaction term between the Noether charge of the Q-ball and the topological monopole charge associated with the worldvolume flux. The monopole charge increases the stability of the analytic solutions against fission...</description>

Abstract: In this paper we parallel the construction of Tong of a gauge theory for shallow water, by writing a gauge theory for the Euler fluid in 2+1 dimensions. We then extend it to an Euler fluid coupled to electromagnetic background. We argue that the gauge theory formulation provides a topological argument for the quantization of 2+1 dimensional Euler Hopfion solution. In the process, we find a (non-gauge) action for the Euler fluid that can be extended to any dimension, including the physical 3+1 dimensions. We discuss several aspects of the ABC flow.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part I: Invertible Symmetries and Higher Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $q$-charges describe the possible actions of a generalized symmetry on $q$-dimensional operators. In Part I of this series of papers, we describe $q$-charges for invertible symmetries; while the discussion of $q$-charges for non-invertible symmetries is the topic of Part II. We argue that $q$-charges of a standard global symmetry, also known as a 0-form symmetry, correspond to the so-called $(q+1)$-representations of the 0-form symmetry group, which are natural higher-categorical generalizations of the standard notion of representations of a group. This generalizes already our understanding of possible charges under a 0-form symmetry! Just like local operators form representations of the 0-form symmetry group, higher-dimensional extended operators form higher-representations. This statement has a straightforward generalization to other invertible symmetries: $q$-charges of higher-form and higher-group symmetries are $(q+1)$-representations of the corresponding higher-groups. There is a natural extension to higher-charges of non-genuine operators (i.e. operators that are attached to higher-dimensional operators), which will be shown to be intertwiners of higher-representations. This brings into play the higher-categorical structure of higher-representations. We also discuss higher-charges of twisted sector operators (i.e. operators that appear at the boundary of topological operators of one dimension higher), including operators that appear at the boundary of condensation defects.</description>

      <title>Classical Dynamics of Vortex Solitons from Perturbative Scattering Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel point-particle effective description of ANO vortex solitons in the critical Abelian Higgs Model (AHM) in $d=2+1$ based on the small winding expansion. Identifying the effective vortices with the elementary quanta of a complex scalar field, relativistic vortex-vortex scattering amplitudes are calculated as a diagrammatic, perturbative expansion in the winding number $N$. Making use of powerful techniques recently developed for analyzing the post-Minkowskian two-body problem in general relativity, we efficiently extract the contribution to the loop integrals from the classical potential region, with the resulting velocity expansion subsequently resummed to all orders. The main result of this paper is an analytic expression for the classical, vortex-vortex potential at $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2\right)$, or one-loop, with exact velocity dependence. By truncating the resulting effective Hamiltonian at $\mathcal{O}\left(p^2\right)$ we derive an analytic, perturbative expression for the metric on the 2-vortex moduli space. Finally, the emergence of the critical AHM from the classical limit of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric AHM, and the resulting constraints on the point-particle EFT is described in detail using an on-shell superspace construction for BPS states in $d=2+1$.</description>

Abstract: This letter explores a transition in the type of von Neumann algebra for asymptotically AdS spacetimes from the implementations of the different gravitational constraints. We denote it as the \emph{centaur-algebra} of observables. In the first part of the letter, we employ a class of flow geometries interpolating between AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ spaces, the centaur geometries. We study the type II$_\infty$ crossed product algebra describing the semiclassical gravitational theory, and we explore the algebra of bounded sub-regions in the bulk theory following $T\overline{T}$ deformations of the geometry and study the gravitational constraints with respect to the quasi-local Brown-York energy of the system at a finite cutoff. In the second part, we study arbitrary asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where we implement the boundary protocol of an infalling observer modeled as a probe black hole proposed by arXiv:2211.16512 to study modifications in the algebra. In both situations, we show how incorporating the constraints requires a type II$_1$ description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the calculation of the three-point function in momentum space of currents for a $SO(3)$ global symmetry, in a three-dimensional toy model within phenomenological holographic cosmology. Since the two-point function gives, via electric-magnetic duality, the resolution of the cosmological monopole problem, the three-point function is related to the monopole non-Gaussianities. We check that the final result is UV and IR finite and satisfies the transverse Ward identities and consider the $k_1\ll k_2,k_3$ case, relevant for cosmology. We also show that the two-loop result for the 3-point function is completely independent of the explicit form of the potential, meaning that, like the solution to the monopole problem, also the non-Gaussianities are universal within the phenomenological holographic cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A previous paper~\cite{Bern:2022kto} identified a puzzle stemming from the amplitudes-based approach to spinning bodies in general relativity: additional Wilson coefficients appear compared to current worldline approaches to conservative dynamics of generic astrophysical objects, including neutron stars. In this paper we clarify the nature of analogous Wilson coefficients in the simpler theory of electrodynamics. We analyze the original field-theory construction, identifying definite-spin states some of which have negative norms, and relating the additional Wilson coefficients in the classical theory to transitions between different quantum spin states. We produce a new version of the theory which also has additional Wilson coefficients, but no negative-norm states. We match, through $\mathcal O(\alpha^2)$ and $\mathcal O(S^2)$, the Compton amplitudes of these field theories with those of a modified worldline theory with extra degrees of freedom introduced by releasing the spin supplementary condition. We build an effective two-body Hamiltonian that matches the impulse and spin kick of the modified field theory and of the worldline theory, displaying additional Wilson coefficients compared to standard worldline approaches. The results are then compactly expressed in terms of an eikonal formula. Our key conclusion is that, contrary to standard approaches, while the magnitude of the spin tensor is still conserved, the magnitude of the spin vector can change under conserved Hamiltonian dynamics and this change is governed by the additional Wilson coefficients. For specific values of Wilson coefficients the results are equivalent to those from a definite spin obeying the spin supplementary condition, but for generic values they are physically inequivalent. These results warrant detailed studies of the corresponding issues in general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss general properties of perturbative RG flows in AdS with a focus on the treatment of boundary conditions and infrared divergences. In contrast with flat-space boundary QFT, general covariance in AdS implies the absence of independent boundary flows. We illustrate how boundary correlation functions remain conformally covariant even if the bulk QFT has a scale. We apply our general discussion to the RG flow between consecutive unitary diagonal minimal models which is triggered by the $\phi_{(1,3)}$ operator. For these theories we conjecture a flow diagram whose form is significantly simpler than that in flat-space boundary QFT. In several stand-alone appendices we discuss two-dimensional BCFTs in general and the minimal model BCFTs in particular. These include both an extensive review as well as the computation of several new BCFT correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an approach to incorporating the physical effects of the absorption of energy by the event horizon of black holes in the scattering amplitudes based post-Minkowskian, point-particle effective description. Absorptive dynamics are incorporated in a model-independent way by coupling the usual point-particle description to an invisible sector of gapless internal degrees-of-freedom. The leading order dynamics of this sector are encoded in the low-energy expansion of a spectral density function obtained by matching an absorption cross section in the ultraviolet description. This information is then recycled using the scattering amplitudes based Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell in-in formalism to calculate the leading absorptive contribution to the impulse and change in rest mass of a Schwarzschild black hole scattering with a second compact body sourcing a massless scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational field. The results obtained are in complete agreement with previous worldline Schwinger-Keldysh calculations and provide an alternative on-shell scattering amplitudes approach to incorporating horizon absorption effects in the gravitational two-body problem.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the general mechanism of partial deconfinement applies to large-$N$ QCD and the partially-deconfined phase inevitably appears between completely-confined and completely-deconfined phases. Furthermore, we propose how the partial deconfinement can be observed in the real-world QCD with the SU(3) gauge group. For this purpose, we employ lattice configurations obtained by the WHOT-QCD collaboration and examine our proposal numerically. In the discussion, the Polyakov loop plays a crucial role in characterizing the phases, without relying on center symmetry, and hence, we clarify the meaning of the Polyakov loop in QCD at large $N$ and finite $N$.
  Both at large $N$ and finite $N$, the complete confinement is characterized by the Haar-random distribution of the Polyakov line phases. Haar-randomness, which is stronger than unbroken center symmetry, indicates that Polyakov loops in any nontrivial representations have vanishing expectation values and deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures is quantified with the loops. We discuss that the transitions separating the partially-deconfined phase are characterized by the behaviors of Polyakov loops in various representations. The lattice QCD data provide us with the signals exhibiting two different characteristic temperatures: deconfinement of the fundamental representation and deconfinement of higher representations. As a nontrivial test for our proposal, we also investigate the relation between partial deconfinement and instanton condensation and confirm the consistency with the lattice data.
  To make the presentation more easily accessible, we provide a detailed review of the previously known aspects of partial deconfinement.</description>

      <title>Investigation of black hole complementarity in AdS$_2$ black holes</title>

Abstract: Black hole complementarity plays a pivotal role in resolving the information loss paradox by treating Hawking radiation as carriers of information, apart from the complicated mechanisms involved in decoding information from this radiation. The thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius, as well as the criteria set forth by Hayden and Preskill, provide deep insights into the intricate relationship of black hole complementarity between fiducial and infalling observers. We execute the Alice-Bob thought experiment in the context of two-dimensional anti-de Sitter black holes. It turns out that information cloning can be avoided in the case of a large black hole. According to the Hayden-Preskill criteria, the scale parameter associated with the explicit breaking of the one-dimensional group of reparametrizations must significantly exceed the squared mass of the black hole to effectively prevent information cloning.</description>

      <title>Large N expansion of superconformal index of k=1 ABJM theory and semiclassical M5 brane partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown in arXiv:2309.10786 that the leading non-perturbative contribution to the large $N$ expansion of superconformal index of (2,0) 6d theory (which describes low-energy dynamics of $N$ coincident M5 branes) is reproduced by the semiclassical partition function of quantum M2 brane wrapped on $S^{1}\times S^{2}$ in a twisted version of AdS$_{7}\times S^{4}$ background. Here we demonstrate an analogous relation for the leading non-perturbative contribution to the large $N$ expansion of the superconformal index of the ${n}=8$ supersymmetric level-one $U(N) \times U(N)$ ABJM theory (which describes low-energy dynamics of $N$ coincident M2 branes). The roles of M2 and M5 branes get effectively interchanged. Namely, the large $N$ correction to the ABJM index is found to be given by the semiclassical partition function of quantum M5 brane wrapped on $S^1 \times S^5$ in a twisted version of AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}$ background. This effectively confirms the suggestion for the "M5 brane index" made in arXiv:2007.05213 on the basis of indirect superconformal algebra considerations.</description>

      <title>Using Weyl operators to study Mermin's inequalities in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mermin's inequalities are investigated in a Quantum Field Theory framework by using von Neumann algebras built with Weyl operators. We devise a general construction based on the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory and use it to compute the vacuum expectation value of the Mermin operator, analyzing the parameter space and explicitly exhibiting a violation of Mermin's inequalities. Therefore, relying on the power of modular operators, we are able to demonstrate that Mermin's inequalities are violated when examined within the vacuum state of a scalar field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise new boundary conditions for the near-horizon geometries of extremal BTZ and Kerr black holes, as well as for the ultra-cold limit of the Kerr-de Sitter black hole. These boundary conditions are obtained as the higher-dimensional uplift of recently proposed boundary conditions in two-dimensional gravity. Their asymptotic symmetries consist in the semi-direct product of a Virasoro and a current algebra, of which we determine the central extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of Type IIB backgrounds that are dual to five dimensional conformal field theories compactified and deformed by VEVs of certain operators. This generates an RG flow into a smooth background dual to non-SUSY gapped field theories in four dimensions. We study various holographic observables: a monotonic quantity associated with the number of degrees of freedom, Wilson loops that interpolate between conformal and confining behaviour with the possibility of screening, Entanglement Entropy, etc. We also give a prescription to compute the Holographic Complexity in this type of backgrounds and calculate the spectrum of spin-two glueballs of the field theories.</description>

      <title>Infinite Temperature is Not So Infinite: The Many Temperatures of de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several distinct concepts of temperature appear in the holographic description of de Sitter space. Conflating these has led to confusion and inconsistent claims. The double-scaled limit of SYK is a concrete model in which we can examine and explain these different concepts of temperature. This note began as an addendum to our paper ``Comments on a Paper by Narovlansky and Verlinde" but in the process of writing it we learned new things -- interesting in their own right -- that we wish to report here.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Wavefunction of the Universe in Inflation with (Resonant) Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistics of scalar perturbations in models of inflation with small and rapid oscillations in the inflaton potential (resonant non-Gaussianity). We do so by deriving the wavefunction $\Psi[\zeta(\boldsymbol{x})]$ non-perturbatively in $\zeta$, but at first order in the amplitude of the oscillations. The expression of the wavefunction of the universe (WFU) is explicit and does not require solving partial differential equations. One finds qualitative deviations from perturbation theory for $ |\zeta| \gtrsim \alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha \gg 1$ is the number of oscillations per Hubble time. Notably, the WFU exhibits distinct behaviours for negative and positive values of $\zeta$ (troughs and peaks respectively). While corrections for $\zeta &lt;0$ remain relatively small, of the order of the oscillation amplitude, positive $\zeta$ yields substantial effects, growing exponentially as $e^{\pi\alpha/2}$ in the limit of large $\zeta$. This indicates that even minute oscillations give large effects on the tail of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Searching for strongly coupled AdS matter with multi-trace deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic CFTs admit a dual emergent description in terms of semiclassical general relativity minimally coupled to matter fields. While the gravitational interactions are required to be suppressed by the Planck scale, the matter sector is allowed to interact strongly at the AdS scale. From the perspective of the dual CFT, this requires breaking large-$N$ factorization in certain sectors of the theory. Exactly marginal multi-trace deformations are capable of achieving this while still preserving a consistent large-$N$ limit. We probe the effect of these deformations on the bulk theory by computing the relevant four-point functions in conformal perturbation theory. We find a simple answer in terms of a finite sum of conformal blocks, indicating that the correlators display no bulk-point singularities. This implies that the matter of the bulk theory is made strongly coupled by boundary terms rather than local bulk interactions. Our results suggest that holographic CFTs that describe strongly coupled AdS matter must be isolated points on the CFT landscape or sit infinitely far away on the conformal manifold from conventional holographic CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We establish simple formulae for computing Finkelstein-Rubinstein signs for Skyrme fields generated in two ways: from instanton ADHM data, and from rational maps. This may be used to compute homotopy classes of general loops in the configuration spaces of skyrmions, and as a result provide a useful tool for a quantum treatment beyond rigid-body quantisation of skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chiral Form Field Theories and $T\overline T$-like Flows in Six and Higher Dimensions</title>

Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of six-dimensional non-linear chiral two-form gauge theories as deformations of free chiral two-form gauge theories driven by stress-tensor $T\overline T$-like flows. To lay the background for this study, we elaborate on the relationship between different Lagrangian formulations of duality-invariant p-form theories and corresponding $T\overline T$-like flows in various dimensions. To this end we propose a new formulation which (i) is a generalization of the four-dimensional construction by Ivanov, Nurmagambetov and Zupnik (INZ) and (ii) turns into the PST formulation upon integrating out an auxiliary self-dual field. We elucidate space-time covariant properties of the PST formulation by clarifying and making use of its relation to the INZ-type formulation and to a so-called ``clone" construction.</description>

      <title>Holographic Inflation, Primordial Black Holes and Early Structure Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence has accumulated that there are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of most galaxies, and that these were formed in the very early universe by some as yet unknown process. In particular, there is evidence [15] that at least some galaxies formed as early as $10^8$ to $10^9$ years after the Big Bang host SMBHs. We suggest that the holographic model of inflation, whose dark matter candidates are primordial black holes carrying a discrete gauge charge, which originated as a small subset of the inflationary horizon volumes in the very early universe, can provide the seeds for this early structure formation. Aspects of the model pointed out long ago suggested an early era of structure formation, with structures dominated by dark matter. The additional assumption that the dark matter consists of discretely charged black holes implies black hole dominance of early structures, which seems to be implied by JWST data.</description>

      <title>The universal thermodynamic properties of Extremely Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extremely compact object (ECO) is defined as a quantum object without horizon, whose radius is just a small distance $s$ outside its Schwarzschild radius. We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>

Abstract: Boundary effects play an interesting role in finite-size physical systems. In this work, we study the boundary-induced properties of 1+1-dimensional critical systems driven by inhomogeneous M\"obius-like quenches. We focus on the entanglement entropy in BCFTs with a large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low-dimensional operators. We find that the choice of boundary conditions leads to different scenarios of dynamical phase transitions. We also derive these results in a holographic description in terms of intersecting branes in AdS$_3$, and find a precise match.</description>

      <title>Cosmological forecasts for future galaxy surveys with the linear point standard ruler: Toward consistent BAO analyses far from a fiducial cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear point (LP) standard ruler was identified as the basis of a purely geometric method for exploiting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The LP exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that, even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted, first by means of linear predictions and then N-body simulations.</description>

Abstract: Phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking are expected for group field theories as a basic feature of the geometogenesis scenario. The following paper aims to investigate the equilibrium phase for group field theory by using the ergodic hypothesis on which the Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions must break down. The breaking of the ergodicity can be considered dynamically, by introducing a fictitious time inducing a stochastic process described through a Langevin equation, from which the randomness of the tensor field will be a consequence. This type of equation is considered particularly for complex just-renormalizable Abelian model of rank d = 5, and we study some of their properties by using a renormalization group considering a coarse- graining both in time and space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Critical Unstable Two-Level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the dynamics of unstable two-level quantum systems by adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other. Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable meson--antimeson and other systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>One-loop Lipatov vertex in QCD with higher $\epsilon$-accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective Reggeon-Reggeon-gluon vertex, known as Lipatov vertex, is the key ingredient that allows to develop the BFKL approach in QCD. Within the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation, it is sufficient to know its one-loop corrections, in dimensional regularization ($D=4+2\epsilon$), up to the constant term in the $\epsilon$-expansion. In the next-to-next-to-leading approximation, however, the one-loop Lipatov vertex is needed up to the order $\epsilon^2$. In this paper we present the expression for this vertex in dimensional regularization up to the required accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the average equation of state for the oscillating inflaton field of the simplest $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We show that the average equation of state can be solved analytically. We discover that when $\alpha$ is small, the average equation of state of the oscillating inflaton field approaches that of a cosmological constant. This is the phenomenon of oscillating inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the programme on mirror symmetry for non-K\"ahler manifolds, we construct representations of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra associated to solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. The construction is via embeddings of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra in the chiral de Rham complex of a string Courant algebroid. Our results require that the connection $\nabla$, one of the unknowns of the system, is Hermitian-Yang-Mills. Our main theorem proves that any solution of the Hull-Strominger system satisfying this condition has an associated $N=2$ embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in non-canonical scalar field inflation driven by quartic potential in the presence of bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) from quartic potential in the presence of a tiny bump in non-canonical inflationary model has been inquired. It is demonstrated that, a viable inflationary era can be driven through the quartic potential in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian density. Furthermore, setting a suitable function of inflaton field as a correction term (like a bump) to the quartic potential, causes the inflaton to slow down for a while. In such a short time span, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations power spectrum on small scales grows up sufficiently versus CMB scales. In addition to the bump feature, the enhancing effect of the $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum has been shown. Fine tuning of three parameter Cases of the model results in generating of three Cases of PBHs. In addition, we investigate the secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during generation of PBHs and show that their contemporary density parameter spectra $(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ can be tracked down by GWs detectors.</description>

      <title>Torsion, Gravity Induced Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Cosmological Bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we elaborate and extend our proposal arXiv:2307.16098 of the cosmological bouncing model in which a chiral condensate violates the null energy condition and induces a bounce. The condensate formation is caused by the gravitational effects that arise in the effective action when the curvature of space-time is non-zero. As the chiral condensation is a vacuum effect, the symmetries of the FRW space-time are not violated. We explicitly calculate the spinor effective action in the presence of a background gravitational field up to second order in curvature and with derivative corrections and also derive the initial conditions of the condensate. In addition, a new interaction term between the condensate and the scalar field is introduced that might be relevant for producing the adiabatic perturbations during the contraction phase. The curvature/energy density stays far from Planckian values throughout this evolution.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Fermionic and Bosonic Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of \emph{complexity} has become pivotal in multiple disciplines, including quantum information, where it serves as an alternative metric for gauging the chaotic evolution of a quantum state. This paper focuses on \emph{Krylov complexity}, a specialized form of quantum complexity that offers an unambiguous and intrinsically meaningful assessment of the spread of a quantum state over all possible orthogonal bases. Our study is situated in the context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information. Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states. We also explore the implications of Krylov complexity for theories proposing complexity as a candidate for holographic duality by computing Krylov complexity for the thermofield double States (TFD) and Dirac field.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Field Perturbations of Black Holes Surrounded by Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We find, by using the sixth order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, that the longest-lived modes are the ones with higher angular number, for a scalar field mass smaller than a critical value, known as anomalous decay rate of the quasinormal modes, while that beyond this critical value the behaviour is inverted. Moreover, we show that it is possible to recover the real part of the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs), the imaginary part of the QNFs, and the critical scalar field mass, of the Schwarzschild background for different values of the PFDM intensity parameter $k$, respectively. For values of $k$ smaller than these values, the mentioned quantities are greater than the Schwarzschild background. However, beyond of these values of $k$, these quantities are smaller than the Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <title>Particle detector models from path integrals of localized quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that domain walls formed in a classical Ginzburg-Landau model can exhibit topologically stable but thermodynamically metastable states. This proposal relies on Allen-Cahn's assertion that the velocity of domain wall is proportional to the mean curvature at each point. From this assertion we speculate that domain wall behaves like a rubber band that can winds the background geometry in a nontrivial way and can exist permanently. We numerically verify our proposal in two and three spatial dimensions by using various boundary conditions. It is found that there are possibilities to form topologically stable domain walls in the final equilibrium states. However, these states have higher free energies, thus are thermodynamically metastable. These metastable states that are protected by topology could potentially serve as storage media in the computer and information technology industry.</description>

      <title>Multiple soft-photon emission at next-to-leading power to all orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper derives a next-to-leading power (NLP) soft theorem for multi-photon emission to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling constant, generalising the leading-power theorem of Yennie, Frautschi, and Suura. Working in the QED version of heavy-quark effective theory, multi-emission amplitudes are shown to reduce to single- and double-radiation contributions only. Single soft-photon emission, in turn, is described by the recent all-order extension of the Low-Burnett-Kroll theorem, where the tree-level formula is supplemented with a one-loop exact soft function. The same approach is used in this article to prove that the genuine double-emission contribution is tree-level exact. As a validation and a first non-trivial application of the multi-photon theorem, the real-real-virtual electron-line corrections to muon-electron scattering are calculated at NLP in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes of scalar and electromagnetic fields in the background of Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet (EsGB) black holes. Using the scalar and electromagnetic field equations in the vicinity of the EsGB black hole, we study nature of the effective potentials. The dependence of real and imaginary parts of the fundamental quasinormal modes on parameter $p$ (which is related to the Gauss--Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$) for different values of multipole numbers $l$ are studied. We analyzed the effects of massive scalar fields on the EsGB black hole, which tells us the existence of quasi--resonances. In the eikonal regime, we find the analytical expression for the quasinormal frequency and show that the correspondence between the eikonal quasinormal modes and null geodesics is valid in the EsGB theory for the test fields. Finally, we study grey-body factors of the electromagnetic fields for different multipole numbers $l$, which deviates from Schwarzschild's black hole.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents and Phase Structure of Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of hyperscaling violating black holes using Lyapunov exponents. For describing hyperscaling violating system, we chose a particular gravity model constructed from generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton action which includes the Lifshitz cases in appropriate limit. We study the relationship between Lyapunov exponents and black hole phase transitions considering both the timelike and null geodesics. We observe that, the black hole phase transiton properties are reflected in Lyapunov exponent where its multiple branches correspond to the distinct phases of the black hole. The discontinuos change of the Lyapunov exponent during the phase transition serve as an order parameter with critical exponent $1/2$ near the critical point. Our numerical study reveals that the correlation between the Lyapunov exponent and black hole thermodynamic properties can be generalised beyond the AdS spacetime. We find that it is independent of the hyperscaling violation parameter as well as the Lifshitz exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Penrose process in the magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Penrose process (MPP) could be highly efficient (efficiency can even exceed $100\%$) for extracting the energy from a Kerr black hole, if it is immersed in a mG order magnetic field. Considering the exact solution of the magnetized Kerr spacetime, here we derive the exact expression of efficiency ($\eta_{\rm MPP}$) for MPP, which is valid for both the Kerr black hole (BH) as well as Kerr superspinar (SS), and also from the weak magnetic field to an ultra-strong magnetic field $(B)$ which can even distort the original Kerr geometry. We show that although the value of $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ increases upto a certain value of ultra-strong magnetic field ($B_p$), it decreases to zero for $B &gt; B_p$, in case of the Kerr BHs. On the other hand, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ shows the opposite behavior in case of the Kerr SSs. One intriguing feature that emerges is, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ acquires the maximum value for the Kerr parameter $a_* \approx 0.786$ (unlike $a_*=1$ for the ordinary PP), decreases for $0.786 &lt; a_* \leq 1$. This indicates that the BH starts to expel the effect of magnetic field for $a_* &gt; 0.786$, and is fully expelled from the extremal Kerr BH due to the gravitational Meissner effect. As a special case of MPP, we also study the ordinary Penrose process (PP) for magnetized Kerr spacetime. We show that MPP for Kerr BHs, Kerr SSs and ordinary PP for Kerr SSs can be superefficient for the astrophysical applications to powering engines in the high-energy sources like active galactic nuclei and quasars, in the weak magnetic fields. Our strong magnetic field result of MPP could be important to the primordial BHs in the early Universe immersed in the primordial magnetic fields, and to the transmuted BHs which are formed by collapsing and/or by merging of the magnetized progenitors. It is almost impossible to extract the energy from a BH (SS) through MPP (PP) in the ultra-strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>WDVV-based recursion for open Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a computability result for open Gromov-Witten invariants based on open WDVV equations. This is analogous to the result of Kontsevich-Manin for closed Gromov-Witten invariants. For greater generality, we base the argument on a formal object, the Frobenius superpotential, that generalizes several different definitions of open Gromov-Witten invariants. As an application, we show that open Gromov-Witten invariants for some products of projective spaces vanish.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>
