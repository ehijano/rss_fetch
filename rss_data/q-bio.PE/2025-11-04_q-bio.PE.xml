      <title>The Future Orchid Diversity of Great Britain and Ireland using an SDM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to forecast the future diversity and distribution of orchids in Great Britain and Ireland under scenarios of climate and land-use change. The study analyzes occurrence data for native orchid taxa in the BSBI database at a fine spatial resolution (1 km^2, monads) and incorporates multiple environmental variables including climate, land use, topography, and soil. These SDMs project significant losses in orchid species richness by 2050 and 2070, especially under severe climate and land-use scenarios, with declines expected across most species and regions, including Ireland where historical data previously indicated gains. The models reveal vulnerable species likely to face extinction by 2070, emphasizing the impact of both climate warming and habitat modifications. This approach differs from previous trend-based analyses by integrating future projections, high-resolution spatial data, and dynamic land-use scenarios, thereby providing higher-resolution estimates of orchid range contractions and diversity losses. While current observed orchid trends show some regional increases, particularly in Ireland, the SDM forecasts indicate substantial future risks. The study also discusses uncertainties due to niche truncation from geographic data limits and highlights the need for broader-scale modeling for more robust predictions. Overall, the paper anticipates conservation challenges for orchid biodiversity in response to ongoing environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Incentives for self-isolation based on incidence rather than prevalence could help to flatten the curve: a modelling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00138</link>

Abstract: In recent years, numerous advances have been made in understanding how epidemic dynamics is affected by changes in individual behaviours. We propose an SIS-based compartmental model to tackle the simultaneous and coupled evolution of an outbreak and of the adoption by individuals of the isolation measure. The compliance with self-isolation is described with the help of the imitation dynamics framework. Individuals are incentivised to isolate based on the prevalence and the incidence rate of the outbreak, and are tempted to defy isolation recommendations depending on the duration of isolation and on the cost of putting social interactions on hold. We are able to derive analytical results on the equilibria of the model under the homogeneous mean-field approximation. Simulating the compartmental model on empirical networks, we also do a preliminary check of the impact of a network structure on our analytical predictions. We find that the dynamics collapses to surprisingly simple regimes where either the imitation dynamics no longer plays a role or the equilibrium prevalence depends on only two parameters of the model, namely the cost and the relative time spent in isolation. Whether individuals prioritise disease prevalence or incidence as an indicator of the state of the outbreak appears to play no role on the equilibria of the dynamics. However, it turns out that favouring incidence may help to flatten the curve in the transient phase of the dynamics. We also find a fair agreement between our analytical predictions and simulations run on an empirical multiplex network.</description>

      <title>How spatial patterns can lead to less resilient ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several theoretical models predict that spatial patterning increases ecosystem resilience. However, these predictions rely on simplifying assumptions, such as assuming isotropic and infinitely large ecosystems, and empirical evidence directly linking spatial patterning to enhanced resilience remains scarce. We introduce a unifying framework, encompassing existing models for vegetation pattern formation in water-stressed ecosystems, that relaxes these assumptions. This framework incorporates finite vegetated areas surrounded by desert and anisotropic environmental conditions that lead to non-reciprocal plant interactions. Under these more realistic conditions, we identify a novel desertification mechanism, known as nonlinear convective instability in physics but largely overlooked in ecology. These instabilities form when non-reciprocal interactions destabilize the vegetation-desert interface and can trigger desertification fronts even under stress levels where isotropic models predict stability. Importantly, ecosystems exhibiting periodic vegetation patterns are more susceptible to nonlinear convective instabilities than those with homogeneous vegetation, suggesting that spatial patterning may reduce, rather than enhance, resilience. These findings challenge the prevailing view that self-organized patterning enhances ecosystem resilience and provide a new framework for investigating how spatial dynamics shape the stability and resilience of ecological systems under changing environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Low Total Fertility in Simple Economic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low total fertility rates throughout the world have lead to concerns about economic growth, military security, international political power, environment impacts, and quality of life. Overall total fertility rates of today's societies are complex emergent functions of culture, biology, and economic policies that are notoriously difficult to forecast. In order to study the dynamic, stochastic nature of total fertility rates, population and wealth trajectories as functions of infertility and birth cost are generated from a minimal, endogenous, agent-based model of a simple foraging economy. A harvesting model from mathematical ecology is added to reflect death by "natural causes". With these added limits of finite lifespans, decreasing total fertility rates are shown to lead to population levels consistently below the actual carry capacity of the landscape. These below carry-capacity population levels generate higher total and per capita wealth. The stochastic population trajectories generated demonstrate instabilities that significantly increase the likelihood of extinction within reasonable time frames. Society may possibly be encouraged by this increasing wealth (and perhaps reduced environmental degradation) to continue decreasing total fertility rates, further increasing the extinction risk. Conversely, the additional wealth might increase total fertility rates through relatively lower birth costs. Tax-funded subsidies are added to the model to determine if directly reducing birth costs can significantly increase total fertility rates to escape these stochastic instabilities. This research demonstrates that understanding attempts to mitigate the consequences of declining total fertility rates must include modeling of the dynamic and stochastic nature of these population trajectories.</description>
