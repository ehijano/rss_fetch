      <title>Notes on C*-algebras, representations, and Morita equivalence (with a view toward C*-algebras of reductive groups)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes give an expanded account of my lectures at the CIRM-IHP research school on 'Methods in representation theory and operator algebras', January 6-10, 2025. Their main goal is to explain a proof of a theorem of A. Wassermann, that identifies the reduced C*-algebra of a real reductive group, up to Morita equivalence, with a direct sum of much simpler C*-algebras. Along the way we introduce the basic theory of representations and Morita equivalence of C*-algebras that is needed to understand the theorem and its proof. The target audience is Masters- and PhD-level students, and other mathematicians who are not specialists in operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Banach manifolds of spectrally small quantum-group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that finite-spectrum representations of compact quantum groups either in unital $C^*$-algebras $A$ or on Banach spaces $E$ exhibit the same Banach-space-modeled differential-geometric structure as their classical analogues: (a) they are Banach analytic manifolds; (b) locally homogeneous under conjugation by the pertinent Banach Lie group $U(A)$ or $GL(E)$; (c) with orbit maps fibering principally; (d) and hence with said orbit maps admitting local analytic splitting.
  We also identify the finite-spectrum unitary representations as precisely those that are norm-continuous in the appropriate sense when the compact quantum group has at least one classical point, again generalizing the classical parallel present in various forms in work of Kallman, Shtern and the author.</description>

      <title>A Banach algebra encoding quantum group duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new Banach algebra structure on the trace-zero subspace $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))_0$ of trace class operators for any locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$; it is defined through a mixed Lie-type product of the two dual products on $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))$ arising from the canonical extensions of the co-products of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. The surprising fact that this new product is indeed associative stems precisely from the duality of the latter two products. This, in particular, gives new faithful associative products on trace-zero matrices in $M_d(\mathbb{C})$. After establishing some basic properties, we show that the single algebra $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))_0$ captures simultaneous properties of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$, is faithful for a large class of quantum groups, and encodes both $M^r_{cb}(L^1(\mathbb{G}))$ and $M^r_{cb}(L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}}))$ as left, respectively right, completely bounded module maps on $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))$. We finish by exhibiting an analogous product on the trace-zero nuclear operators $\mathcal{N}(L^p(G))_0$ for a locally compact group $G$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$. Building on [7], our work suggests an approach for developing an $L^p$-version of locally compact quantum group theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrics from length functions on \'etale groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct a compact quantum metric space from a proper continuous length function on an \'etale groupoid with compact unit space, where the unit space additionally has the structure of a compact metric space. Using compactly supported Fourier multipliers on the reduced groupoid $C^*$-algebra we provide a sufficient condition for verifying when we obtain a compact quantum metric space in this manner. The condition is sometimes also necessary, and is new even in the case of length functions on discrete groups. Lastly, we employ the condition to show that any AF groupoid with compact unit space can be equipped with a length function from which we obtain a compact quantum metric space, thereby providing a groupoid approach to understanding the quantum metric geometry of unital AF algebras.</description>

      <title>A going-down principle for {\'e}tale groupoids and the Baum-Connes conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a going-down principle for {\'e}tale groupoids and its applications, extending the earlier results for locally compact groups by Chabert, Echterhoff and Oyono-Oyono, and for ample groupoids by B{\"o}nicke and by B{\"o}nicke-Dell'Aiera. The proof in the general {\'e}tale groupoid setting is based on a more detailed study of groupoid simplicial complexes. We also study a bicategorical functoriality involving the induction functors from {\'e}tale groupoid correspondences, which was introduced by Miller. This yields a bicategorical interpretation of the induction-restriction adjunction. As an application of the going-down principle, we provide a proof of the split injectivity of Baum-Connes assembly map for {\'e}tale groupoids that are strongly amenable at infinity, recovering a result obtained by B{\"o}nicke and Proietti via a categorical approach. The going-down principle is also applied on the proof of continuity of topological K-theory of {\'e}tale groupoids and the study of scope of validity of K{\"u}nneth formulas.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists a C*-diagonal with Cantor spectrum in the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_k$ for $2 \le k &lt; \infty$. Our method generalises to an uncountable family of UCT Kirchberg algebras with distinct K-theory. Moreover, we construct principal \'etale groupoid models for these Cuntz algebras and UCT Kirchberg algebras.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha =n&lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

      <title>A note on strong similarity and the Connes embedding problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a completely bounded (c.b. in short) homomorphism $u$ from a $C^*$-algebra $C$ with the lifting property (in short LP) into a QWEP von Neumann algebra $N$ that is not strongly similar to a $*$-homomorphism, i.e. the similarities that ``orthogonalize" $u$ (which exist since $u$ is c.b.) cannot belong to the von Neumann algebra $N$. Moreover, the map $u$ does not admit any c.b. lifting up into the WEP $C^*$-algebra of which $N$ is a quotient. We can take $C=C^*(F_\infty)$ the full $C^*$-algebra of the free group $F_\infty$ with infinitely many generators and $N= B(H)\bar \otimes M$ where $M$ is the von Neumann algebra generated by the reduced $C^*$-algebra of $F_\infty$. Incidentally we observe an analogue for strong similarity of Haagerup's (and Paulsen's) similarity formula for the cb-norm : if $C$ is any unital $C^*$-algebra and $N$ any von Neumann algebra then for any bounded unital homomorphism $u: C \to N$ we have $$\|u\|_{mb}= \inf\{ \|S\|\|S^{-1}\| \}$$ where the inf (which is attained) runs over all invertible $S\in N$ such that $S u(.) S^{-1}$ is a $*$-homomorphism. We end the note by a quick proof of the main point using the mb-norm and the space $R_n\cap C_n$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact metric space, and let $A$ be a pure $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra. We show that $C(X,A)$ is pure whenever $A$ is simple; or every quotient of $A$ is stably finite (e.g., $A$ has stable rank one).
  Using permanence properties of pureness, we prove that the tensor product of any such $A$ with any ASH-algebra is pure.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <title>Teleportation=Translation: Continuous recovery of black hole information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \textit{Teleportation=Translation} conjecture posits that the recovery of information from a black hole is dual to a geometric translation in the emergent spacetime. In this paper, we establish this equivalence for general local quantum field theories by constructing a continuous unitary interpolation that bridges discrete algebraic teleportation protocols and continuous modular flow. We resolve the failure of dynamic idempotency, fundamentally inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite Type~II$_\infty$ envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path. Crucially, we prove that its unique infinitesimal generator $\tilde{G}$ is exactly twice the geometric modular momentum ($\tilde{G}=2P$). We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that unitary information recovery fundamentally manifests as a continuous geometric translation. This provides a rigorous operator-algebraic mechanism for resolving the black hole information paradox, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction.</description>
