      <title>Forecasting causal dynamics with universal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterated multistep forecasting scheme based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) is proposed for the time series generated by causal chains with infinite memory. This forecasting strategy contains, as a particular case, the iterative prediction strategies for dynamical systems that are customary in reservoir computing. Readily computable error bounds are obtained as a function of the forecasting horizon, functional and dynamical features of the specific RNN used, and the approximation error committed by it. The framework in the paper circumvents difficult-to-verify embedding hypotheses that appear in previous references in the literature and applies to new situations like the finite-dimensional observations of functional differential equations or the deterministic parts of stochastic processes to which standard embedding techniques do not necessarily apply.</description>

      <title>On shrinking targets for linear expanding and hyperbolic toral endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an invertible $d\times d$ matrix with integer elements. Then $A$ determines a self-map $T$ of the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d=\mathbb{R}^d/\mathbb{Z}^d$. Given a real number $\tau&gt;0$, and a sequence $\{z_n\}$ of points in $\mathbb{T}^d$, let $W_\tau$ be the set of points $x\in\mathbb{T}^d$ such that $T^n(x)\in B(z_n,e^{-n\tau})$ for infinitely many $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The Hausdorff dimension of $W_\tau$ has previously been studied by Hill--Velani and Li--Liao--Velani--Zorin. We provide complete results on the Hausdorff dimension of $W_\tau$ for any expanding matrix. For hyperbolic matrices, we compute the dimension of $W_\tau$ only when $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix. We give counterexamples to a natural candidate for a dimension formula for general dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Ulam's method for computing stationary densities of invariant measures for piecewise convex maps with countably infinite number of branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\tau: I=[0, 1]\to [0, 1]$ be a piecewise convex map with countably infinite number of branches. In \cite{GIR}, the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) $\mu$ for $\tau$ and the exactness of the system $(\tau, \mu)$ has been proven. In this paper, we develop an Ulam method for approximation of $f^*$, the density of ACIM $\mu$. We construct a sequence $\{\tau_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of maps $\tau_n: I\to I$ s. t. $\tau_n$ has a finite number of branches and the sequence $\tau_n$ converges to $\tau$ almost uniformly. Using supremum norms and Lasota-Yorke type inequalities, we prove the existence of ACIMs $\mu_n$ for $\tau_n$ with the densities $f_n$. For a fixed $n$, we apply Ulam's method with $k$ subintervals to $\tau_n$ and compute approximations $f_{n,k}$ of $f_n$. We prove that $f_{n,k}\to f^*$ as $n\to \infty, k\to \infty,$ both a.e. and in $L^1$. We provide examples of piecewise convex maps $\tau$ with countably infinite number of branches, their approximations $\tau_n$ with finite number of branches and for increasing values of parameter $k$ show the errors $\|f^*-f_{n,k}\|_1$.</description>

      <title>Universal exponential pointwise convergence for weighted multiple ergodic averages over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing an accelerated weighting method, we establish arbitrary polynomial and exponential pointwise convergence for multiple ergodic averages under general conditions in both discrete and continuous settings, involving quasi-periodic and almost periodic cases, which breaks the well known slow convergence rate observed in classical ergodic theory. We also present joint Diophantine rotations as explicit applications. Especially, in the sense that excluding nearly rational rotations with zero measure, we demonstrate that the pointwise exponential convergence is universal via analytic observables, even when multiplicatively averaging over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $, utilizing a novel truncated approach. Moreover, by constructing counterexamples concerning with multiple ergodicity, we highlight the irremovability of the joint nonresonance and establish the optimality of our weighting method in preserving rapid convergence. We also provide numerical simulations with analysis to further illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Inner Functions and Laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study orbit counting problems for inner functions using geodesic and horocyclic flows on Riemann surface laminations. For a one component inner function of finite Lyapunov exponent with $F(0) = 0$, other than $z \to z^d$, we show that the number of pre-images of a point $z \in \mathbb{D} \setminus \{ 0\}$ that lie in a ball of hyperbolic radius $R$ centered at the origin satisfies $$ \mathcal{N}(z, R) \, \sim \, \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{|z|} \cdot \frac{1}{\int_{\partial \mathbb{D}} \log |F'| dm}, \quad \text{as }R \to \infty. $$ For a general inner function of finite Lyapunov exponent, we show that the above formula holds up to a Ces\`aro average. Our main insight is that iteration along almost every inverse orbit is asymptotically linear. We also prove analogues of these results for parabolic inner functions of infinite height.</description>

      <title>General harmonic measures for distance-expanding dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially motivated by the study of I. Binder, N. Makarov, and S. Smirnov [BMS03] on dimension spectra of polynomial Cantor sets, we initiate the investigation on some general harmonic measures, inspired by Sullivan's dictionary, for distance-expanding dynamical systems. Let $f\colon X\to X$ be an open distance-expanding map on a compact metric space $(X,\rho)$. A Gromov hyperbolic tile graph $\Gamma$ associated to the dynamical system $(X,f)$ is constructed following the ideas from M. Bonk, D. Meyer [BM17] and P. Ha\"issinsky, K. M. Pilgrim [HP09]. We consider a class of one-sided random walks associated with $(X,f)$ on $\Gamma$. They induce a Martin boundary of the tile graph, which may be different from the hyperbolic boundary. We show that the Martin boundary of such a random walk admits a surjection to $X$. We provide a class of examples to show that the surjection may not be a homeomorphism. Such random walks also induce measures on $X$ called harmonic measures. When $\rho$ is a visual metric, we establish an equality between the fractal dimension of the harmonic measure and the asymptotic quantities of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Dimension of homogeneous iterated function systems with algebraic translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \mu $ be the self-similar measure associated with a homogeneous iterated function system $ \Phi = \{ \lambda x + t_j \}_{j=1}^m $ on ${\Bbb R}$ and a probability vector $ (p_{j})_{j=1}^m$, where $0\neq \lambda\in (-1,1)$ and $t_j\in {\Bbb R}$. Recently by modifying the arguments of Varj\'u (2019), Rapaport and Varj\'u (2024) showed that if $t_1,\ldots, t_m$ are rational numbers and $0&lt;\lambda&lt;1$, then $$ \dim \mu =\min\Big \{ 1, \; \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m p_{j}\log p_{j}}{ \log |\lambda| }\Big\}$$ unless $ \Phi $ has exact overlaps. In this paper, we further show that the above equality holds in the case when $t_1,\ldots, t_m$ are algebraic numbers and $0&lt;|\lambda|&lt;1$. This is done by adapting and extending the ideas employed in the recent papers of Breuillard, Rapaport and Varj\'u.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Dynamics Using Kalman Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Simulation Model of a Cement Clinker Rotary Kiln</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a systematic description and results of a dynamical simulation model of a rotary kiln for clinker, based on first engineering principles. The model is built upon thermophysical, chemical, and transportation models for both the formation of clinker phases and fuel combustion in the kiln. The model is presented as a 1D model with counter-flow between gas and clinker phases and is demonstrated by a simulation using industrially relevant input. An advantage of the proposed model is that it provides the evolution of the individual compounds for both the fuel and clinker. As such, the model comprises a stepping stone for evaluating the development of process control systems for existing cement plants.</description>

      <title>A First-Engineering Principles Model for Dynamical Simulation of a Calciner in Cement Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an index-1 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model for dynamic simulation of a calciner in the pyro-section of a cement plant. The model is based on first engineering principles and integrates reactor geometry, thermo-physical properties, transport phenomena, stoichiometry and kinetics, mass and energy balances, and algebraic volume and internal energy equations in a systematic manner. The model can be used for dynamic simulation of the calciner. We also provide simulation results that are qualitatively correct. The calciner model is part of an overall model for dynamical simulation of the pyro-section in a cement plant. This model can be used in design of control and optimization systems to improve the energy efficiency and \ce{CO2} emission from cement plants.</description>

      <title>On the coincidence of the Hausdorff and box dimensions for some affine-invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ K $ be a compact subset of the $d$-torus invariant under an expanding diagonal endomorphism with $ s $ distinct eigenvalues. Suppose the symbolic coding of $K$ satisfies weak specification. When $ s \leq 2 $, we prove that the following three statements are equivalent: (A) the Hausdorff and box dimensions of $ K $ coincide; (B) with respect to some gauge function, the Hausdorff measure of $ K $ is positive and finite; (C) the Hausdorff dimension of the measure of maximal entropy on $ K $ attains the Hausdorff dimension of $ K $. When $ s \geq 3 $, we find some examples in which (A) does not hold but (C) holds, which is a new phenomenon not appearing in the planar cases. Through a different probabilistic approach, we establish the equivalence of (A) and (B) for Bedford-McMullen sponges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider non-singular Morse-Smale flows on closed orientable 3-manifolds, under the assumption that among the periodic orbits of the flow there is only one saddle orbit and it is twisted. It is found that any manifold admitting such flows is either a lens space, or a connected sum of a lens space with a projective space, or Seifert manifolds with base sphere and three special layers. A complete topological classification of the described flows is obtained and the number of their equivalence classes on each admissible manifold is calculated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The note is devoted to multiple mixing, spectrum, rank and self-joinings of measure-preserving transformations. We recall famous open problems, discuss related questions and some known results. A hypothetical example of an automorphism of the class $MSJ(2)\setminus MSJ(3)$ has Lebesgue spectrum, infinite rank and does not have multiple mixing. If its spectrum is simple, then we get a solution to the problems of Banach, Rokhlin and del Junco-Rudolph. The existence of such an example, of course, seems unlikely, but any facts confirming the impossibility of this amazing situation have not yet been discovered. They not found even under the condition that its local rank is positive, which ensures the finite spectral multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Identification Near a Supercritical Hopf Bifurcation Using Phase-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven model identification strategy is developed for dynamical systems near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation with nonautonomous inputs. This strategy draws on phase-amplitude reduction techniques, leveraging an analytical representation for the phase and amplitude response curves of the Hopf normal form to infer system parameters. Fitting can be performed by recording the system output during the relaxation to the stable limit cycle after applying as few as two carefully timed pulse inputs. This strategy is illustrated in two examples with relevance to circadian oscillations. In each example, the proposed model identification strategy allows for the formulation, solution, and implementation of a closed loop nonlinear optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Principles of Invariant Measures of Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large deviation principle of invariant measures of stochastic reaction-diffusion lattice systems driven by multiplicative noise. We first show that any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of the stochastic system must be an invariant measure of the deterministic limiting system as noise intensity approaches zero. We then prove the uniform Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations of solution paths over all initial data and the uniform Dembo-Zeitouni large deviations of solution paths over a compact set of initial data. We finally establish the large deviations of invariant measures by combining the idea of tail-ends estimates and the argument of weighted spaces.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and utilize this bound to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD goes as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>Bridging discrete and continuous state spaces: Exploring the Ehrenfest process in time-continuous diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling via stochastic processes has led to remarkable empirical results as well as to recent advances in their theoretical understanding. In principle, both space and time of the processes can be discrete or continuous. In this work, we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular, we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry over methods from one to the respective other setting. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching. We demonstrate our methods in multiple convincing numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J. Silverman proved that a dynamical system on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descends to the field of moduli if it is polynomial or it has even degree, but for non-polynomial ones of odd degree the picture is less clear. We give a complete characterization of which dynamical systems over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descend to the field of moduli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a positive answer to a question of J. Doyle and J. Silverman about fields of definition of dynamical systems on $\mathbb{P}^{n}$. We prove that, for fixed $n$, there exists a constant $C_{n}$ such that every dynamical system $\mathbb{P}^{n}\to\mathbb{P}^{n}$ is defined over an extension of degree $\le C_{n}$ of the field of moduli. More generally, the same bound works for any kind of "algebraic structure" defined over $\mathbb{P}^{n}$, such as embedded curves, hypersurfaces, algebraic cycles. As a consequence we prove that, if $x\in X(k)$ is a rational point of an $n$-dimensional variety with quotient singularities, there exists a field extension $k'/k$ of degree $\le C_{n-1}$ such that $x$ lifts to a $k'$-rational point of any resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and phase-space structures in KCN molecular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of the phase-space structures of KCN molecular system as a function of the vibrational energy using Lagrangian descriptors. For low energies, the motion is mostly regular around the absolute minimum of the potential energy surface. As the energy increases, the phase space combines regions with regular and chaotic motion, a difference that is well captured by the Lagrangian descriptors. We show that the dynamics is mostly governed by the invariant manifolds of the stretch periodic orbits located at the top of one of the energetic barriers of the system. Furthermore, we show a perfect agreement between the bifurcation theory and the differences observed in the phase-space structures as the vibrational energy is modified. The accuracy of our calculations is also assessed by explicit comparison with the invariant manifolds computed using linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>A strong Borel--Cantelli lemma for recurrence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a mixing dynamical systems $([0,1], T, \mu)$, for instance a piecewise expanding interval map with a Gibbs measure $\mu$. Given a non-summable sequence $(m_k)$ of non-negative numbers, one may define $r_k (x)$ such that $\mu (B(x, r_k(x)) = m_k$. It is proved that for almost all $x$, the number of $k \leq n$ such that $T^k (x) \in B_k (x)$ is approximately equal to $m_1 + \ldots + m_n$. This is a sort of strong Borel--Cantelli lemma for recurrence.
  A consequence is that \[
  \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{\log \tau_{B(x,r)} (x)}{- \log \mu (B (x,r))}
  = 1 \] for almost every $x$, where $\tau$ is the return time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give two results for deducing dynamical properties of piecewise M\"obius interval maps from their related planar extensions. First, eventual expansivity and the existence of an ergodic invariant probability measure equivalent to Lebesgue measure both follow from mild finiteness conditions on the planar extension along with a new property ``bounded non-full range" used to relax traditional Markov conditions. Second, the ``quilting" operation to appropriately nearby planar systems, introduced by Kraaikamp and co-authors, can be used to prove several key dynamical properties of a piecewise M\"obius interval map. As a proof of concept, we apply these results to recover known results on the well-studied Nakada $\alpha$-continued fractions; we obtain similar results for interval maps derived from an infinite family of non-commensurable Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <title>Melnikov's persistence for completely degenerate Hamiltonian systems with high co-dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Melnikov's persistence about lower-dimensional invariant tori for completely degenerate Hamiltonian systems with the following Hamiltonian \begin{equation*} H(x,y,u,v)=h(y)+g(u,v)+\varepsilon P(x,y,u,v),~~~(x,y,u,v)\in \mathbb{T}^n\times{G}\times \mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^d, \end{equation*} where $n\geq2$ and $d\geq1$ are positive integers, $g=o(|u|^2+|v|^2)$ admits complete degeneracy and certain transversality, and $\varepsilon P$ is the small perturbation. This is a try in studying lower-dimensional invariant tori in the normal degeneracy of high co-dimension, i.e., $d\geq1$. Under {R\"{u}ssmann-like} non-degenerate condition and transversality condition, we apply the homotopy invariance of topological degree to remove the first order terms about $u$ and $v$ and employ the quasi-linear KAM iterative procedure to derive the persistence of lower-dimensional invariant tori.</description>

Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Klein-Gordon lattice with periodic boundary conditions, for $d \leq 3$. We consider initial data supported on one low-frequency Fourier mode. We show that, in the continuous approximation, the resonant normal form of the system is given by a small-dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. By exploiting a result about the growth of Sobolev norms for solutions of small-dispersion NLS, we are able to describe an energy cascade phenomenon for the Klein-Gordon lattice, where part of the energy is transferred to modes associated to higher frequencies. Such phenomenon holds within the time-scale for which we can ensure the validity of the continuous approximation.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. This note is inspired by a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that for a locally compact second countable group $G$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach for stability analysis of delay systems: Applications to network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the network stability or synchronization dynamics of multi-agent systems with time delays is of significant importance in numerous real-world applications. Such investigations often rely on solving the transcendental characteristic equations (TCEs) obtained from linearization of the considered systems around specific solutions. While stability results based on the TCEs with real-valued coefficients induced by symmetric networks in time-delayed models have been extensively explored in the literature, there remains a notable gap in stability analysis for the TCEs with complexvalued coefficients arising from asymmetric networked dynamics with time delays. To address this challenge comprehensively, we propose a rigorously geometric approach. By identifying and studying the stability crossing curves in the complex plane, we are able to determine the stability region of these systems. This approach is not only suitable for analyzing the stability of models with discrete time delays but also for models with various types of delays, including distributed time delays. Additionally, it can also handle random networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in designing delayed control strategies for car-following systems, mechanical systems, and deep brain stimulation modeling, where involved are complex-valued TCEs or/and different types of delays. All these therefore highlight the broad applicability of our approach across diverse domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the co-spectral radius of inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving equivalence relations, as the sampling exponent of a generating random walk on the ambient relation. The co-spectral radius is analogous to the spectral radius for random walks on $G/H$ for inclusion $H\leq G$ of groups. For the proof, we develop a more general version of the 2-3 method we used in another work on the growth of unimodular random rooted trees. We use this method to show that the walk growth exists for an arbitrary unimodular random rooted graph of bounded degree. We also investigate how the co-spectral radius behaves for hyperfinite relations, and discuss new critical exponents for percolation that can be defined using the co-spectral radius.</description>

Moreover, this orbit equivalence relation is uniquely determined by the invariant random subgroup of the approximate homomorphism. We record applications of this result to recover various known stability and conjugacy characterizations for almost homomorphisms of amenable groups.</description>

Abstract: The modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the upper-half plane $\mathbb{HP}$ with quotient the modular orbifold, uniformized by the function $\mathfrak{j} \colon \mathbb{HP}\to \mathbb{C}$. We first show that second derived subgroup $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})''$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ Galois cover of the modular orbifold by a hexpunctured plane, uniformized by the hexponential map $\operatorname{hexp} \colon \mathbb{HP} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus (\omega_0\mathbb{Z}[j])$, which is a primitive of $C\eta^4$ where $\omega_0\in i\mathbb{R}$ and $C\in \mathbb{R}$ are explicit constants and $\eta$ is Dedekind eta function. We describe the values of the cusp-compactification $\partial \operatorname{hexp}\colon \mathbb{QP}^1\to \omega_0 \mathbb{Z}[j]$. After defining the radial-compactification $\operatorname{Shexp} \colon \mathscr{R} \to \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z})$, we construct a simple section $\operatorname{InSh} \colon \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathscr{S} \bmod{\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})'}$ where $\mathscr{S} \subset \mathbb{RP}^1$ is a set of numbers whose continued fraction expansions arise from Sturmian sequences, which contains the set $\mathscr{M}$ of Markov quadratic irrationals as those numbers arising from periodic Sturmian sequences. We will show that the values of $\operatorname{InSh}$ are either Markov quadratic irrationals or transcendental. Finally we provide a continued fraction expansion for $\operatorname{hexp}$, and discuss its monodromy.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma)&lt;\mathcal{A} &lt; C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A}=C(Y)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu)\rtimes\Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$ Under simple and natural conditions, the left and right rotation vectors coincide and a precise analog of the well-known H. Poincar\'e's result is derived for $k&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of classic bootstrap percolation in which two competing processes concurrently evolve on the same graph $G(n,p)$. Nodes can be in one of three states, conveniently represented by different colors: red, black and white. Initially, a given number $a_R$ of active red nodes (red seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the $n$ nodes. Similarly, a given number $a_B$ of active black nodes (black seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the other $n-a_R$ nodes. All remaining nodes are initially white (inactive). White nodes wake up at times dictated by independent Poisson clocks of rate 1. When a white node wakes up, it checks the state of its neighbors: if the number of red (black) neighbors exceeds the number of black (red) neighbors by a fixed amount $r \geq 2$, the node becomes an active red (black) node, and remains so forever. The parameters of the model are, besides $r$ (fixed) and $n$ (tending to $\infty$), the numbers $a_R$ ($a_B$) of initial red (black) seeds, and the edge existence probability $p=p(n)$. We study the size $A^*_R$ ($A^*_B$) of the final set of active red (black) nodes, identifying different regimes which are analyzed under suitable time-scales, allowing us to obtain detailed (asymptotic) temporal dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>
