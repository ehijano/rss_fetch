      <title>Likelihood-Based Jump Detection and Cosmic Ray Rejection for Detectors Read Out Up-the-Ramp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper implements likelihood-based jump detection for detectors read out up-the-ramp, using the entire set of reads to compute likelihoods. The approach compares the $\chi^2$ value of a fit with and without a jump for every possible jump location. I show that this approach can be substantially more sensitive than one that only uses the difference between sequential groups of reads, especially for long ramps and for jumps that occur in the middle of a group of reads. It can also be implemented for a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$20 seconds, including iterative cosmic ray detection and removal, on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at \url{https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp}. I also provide tests and demonstrations of the full ramp fitting and cosmic ray rejection approach on data from JWST.</description>

      <title>Laboratory demonstration of a Photonic Lantern Nuller in monochromatic and broadband light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic lantern nulling (PLN) is a method for enabling the detection and characterization of close-in exoplanets by exploiting the symmetries of the ports of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to cancel out starlight. A six-port MSPL provides four ports where on-axis starlight is suppressed, while off-axis planet light is coupled with efficiencies that vary as a function of the planet's spatial position. We characterize the properties of a six-port MSPL in the laboratory and perform the first testbed demonstration of the PLN in monochromatic light (1569 nm) and in broadband light (1450 nm to 1625 nm), each using two orthogonal polarizations. We compare the measured spatial throughput maps with those predicted by simulations using the lantern's modes. We find that the morphologies of the measured throughput maps are reproduced by the simulations, though the real lantern is lossy and has lower throughputs overall. The measured ratios of on-axis stellar leakage to peak off-axis throughput are around 10^(-2), likely limited by testbed wavefront errors. These null-depths are already sufficient for observing young gas giants at the diffraction limit using ground-based observatories. Future work includes using wavefront control to further improve the nulls, as well as testing and validating the PLN on-sky.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric limitations for high-frequency ground-based VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution images in astronomy. The sharpest resolution is nominally achieved at the highest frequencies, but as the observing frequency increases so too does the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, degrading the sensitivity of the array and hampering detection. In this paper, we explore the limits of high-frequency VLBI observations using ngehtsim, a new tool for generating realistic synthetic data. ngehtsim uses detailed historical atmospheric models to simulate observing conditions, and it employs heuristic visibility detection criteria that emulate single- and multi-frequency VLBI calibration strategies. We demonstrate the fidelity of ngehtsim's predictions using a comparison with existing 230 GHz data taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and we simulate the expected performance of EHT observations at 345 GHz. Though the EHT achieves a nearly 100% detection rate at 230 GHz, our simulations indicate that it should expect substantially poorer performance at 345 GHz; in particular, observations of M87 at 345 GHz are predicted to achieve detection rates of $\lesssim$20% that may preclude imaging. Increasing the array sensitivity through wider bandwidths and/or longer integration times -- as enabled through, e.g., the simultaneous multi-frequency upgrades envisioned for the next-generation EHT -- can improve the 345 GHz prospects and yield detection levels that are comparable to those at 230 GHz. M87 and Sgr A* observations carried out in the atmospheric window around 460 GHz could expect to regularly achieve multiple detections on long baselines, but analogous observations at 690 and 875 GHz consistently obtain almost no detections at all.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>PyCPL: The ESO Common Pipeline Library in Python v1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyCPL provides full access to ESO's Common Pipeline Library ( CPL) for astronomical data reduction within a Python environment. Not only does it offer a Python interface to the robust CPL library, but it also lets users and developers fully utilise the rest of the scientific Python ecosystem. We have written a C++ layer to CPL and with pybind11 (a third-party library) created a Pythonic API to CPL. Since CPL has been around for so long, it has been thoroughly tested and understood. In 2003 it was developed in C due to its efficiency and speed of execution. With the community however moving away from C/C++ programming and embracing Python for data processing tasks, there is a need to provide access to the CPL utilities within a Python environment. With the latest version being released users can now install PyCPL to run existing CPL recipes (written in C) and access the results from Python. It also provides the ability to create new recipes in Python using the functionality provided by CPL.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Identification of Contaminated Images in Light Curves Data Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude is one of the crucial parameters for space objects and plays a vital role in collision prediction and debris removal. Analyzing light curves to determine attitude is the most commonly used method. In photometric observations, outliers may exist in the obtained light curves due to various reasons. Therefore, preprocessing is required to remove these outliers to obtain high quality light curves. Through statistical analysis, the reasons leading to outliers can be categorized into two main types: first, the brightness of the object significantly increases due to the passage of a star nearby, referred to as "stellar contamination," and second, the brightness markedly decreases due to cloudy cover, referred to as "cloudy contamination." Traditional approach of manually inspecting images for contamination is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, We propose the utilization of machine learning methods as a substitute. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed to identify cases of stellar contamination and cloudy contamination, achieving F1 scores of 1.00 and 0.98 on test set, respectively. We also explored other machine learning methods such as Residual Network-18 (ResNet-18) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM), then conducted comparative analyses of the results.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: a Framework for Detecting Strong Lenses in the Multi-color Imaging Survey by the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for investigating dark matter and dark energy properties. With the advent of large-scale sky surveys, we can discover strong lensing systems on an unprecedented scale, which requires efficient tools to extract them from billions of astronomical objects. The existing mainstream lens-finding tools are based on machine learning algorithms and applied to cut-out-centered galaxies. However, according to the design and survey strategy of optical surveys by CSST, preparing cutouts with multiple bands requires considerable efforts. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a framework based on a hierarchical visual Transformer with a sliding window technique to search for strong lensing systems within entire images. Moreover, given that multi-color images of strong lensing systems can provide insights into their physical characteristics, our framework is specifically crafted to identify strong lensing systems in images with any number of channels. As evaluated using CSST mock data based on an Semi-Analytic Model named CosmoDC2, our framework achieves precision and recall rates of 0.98 and 0.90, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in real observations, we have applied it to a subset of images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and media images from Euclid Early Release Observations. 61 new strong lensing system candidates are discovered by our method. However, we also identified false positives arising primarily from the simplified galaxy morphology assumptions within the simulation. This underscores the practical limitations of our approach while simultaneously highlighting potential avenues for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the atmospheric absorption profile with isotropic background events observed by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes rely on the Earth's atmosphere as part of the detector. The presence of clouds affects observations and can introduce biases if not corrected for. Correction methods typically require an atmospheric profile, that can be measured with external atmospheric monitoring devices. We present a novel method for measuring the atmospheric profile using the data from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes directly. The method exploits the comparison of average longitudinal distributions of the registered Cherenkov light between clear atmosphere and cloud presence cases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a subarray of four Large-Sized Telescopes of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory and a simple cloud model we evaluate the accuracy of the method in determining the basic cloud parameters. We find that the method can reconstruct the transmission of typical clouds with an absolute accuracy of a few per cent. For low-zenith observations, the height of the cloud centre can be reconstructed with a typical accuracy of a few hundred metres, while the geometrical thickness can be accurately reconstructed only if it is &gt;= 3 km. We also evaluate the robustness of the method against the typical systematic uncertainties affecting atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Online Observation Quality System Implementation for the ASTRI Mini-Array Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ASTRI Mini-Array project, led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, aims to construct and operate nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes for high-energy gamma-ray source study and stellar intensity interferometry. Located at the Teide Astronomical Observatory in Tenerife, the project's software is essential for remote operation, emphasizing the need for prompt feedback on observations. This contribution introduces the Online Observation Quality System (OOQS) as part of the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) software. OOQS performs real-time data quality checks on data from Cherenkov cameras and Intensity Interferometry instruments. It provides feedback to SCADA and operators, highlighting abnormal conditions and ensuring quick corrective actions for optimal observations. Results are archived for operator visualization and further analysis. The OOQS data quality pipeline prototype utilizes a distributed application with three main components to handle the maximum array data rate of 1.15 Gb/s. The first is a Kafka consumer that manages the data stream from the Array Data Acquisition System through Apache Kafka, handling the data serialization and deserialization involved in the transmission. The data stream is divided into batches of data written in files. The second component monitors new files and conducts analyses using the Slurm workload scheduler, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities and scalability. Finally, the process results are collected by the last component and stored in the Quality Archive.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Back-Linked Fabry-Perot Interferometer for the Space Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The back-linked Fabry-Perot interferometer (BLFPI) is an interferometer topology proposed for space gravitational wave antennas with the use of inter-satellite Fabry-Perot interferometers. The BLFPI offers simultaneous and independent control over all interferometer length degrees of freedom by controlling the laser frequencies. Therefore, BLFPI does not require an active control system for the physical lengths of the inter-satellite Fabry-Perot interferometers. To achieve a high sensitivity, the implementation must rely on an offline signal process for subtracting laser frequency noises. However, the subtraction has not been experimentally verified to date. This paper reports a demonstration of the frequency noise subtraction in the frequency band of 100 Hz-50 kHz, including the cavity pole frequency, using Fabry-Perot cavities with a length of 46 cm. The highest reduction ratio of approximately 200 was achieved. This marks the first experimental verification of the critical function in the BLFPI.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in the solar system with tetrahedral spacecraft formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetrahedral configurations of spacecraft on unperturbed heliocentric orbits allow for highly precise observations of small spatial changes in the gravitational field, especially those affecting the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The resulting high sensitivity may be used to search for new physics that could manifest itself via deviations from general relativistic behavior yielding a non-vanishing trace[GGT]. We study the feasibility of recovering the trace[GGT] with the sensitivity of O(1e-24 s^(-2)) -- the level where some of the recently proposed cosmological models may have observable effects in the solar system. We consider how local measurements provided by precision laser ranging and atom-wave interferometry can be used for that purpose. We report on a preliminary study of such an experiment and precision that may be reached in measuring the trace[GGT], with the assumption of drag-compensated spacecraft by atom interferometer measurements. For that, we study the dynamical behavior of a tetrahedral formation established by four spacecraft on heliocentric nearby elliptical orbits. We formulate the observational equations to measure the trace[GGT] relying only on the observables available within the formation: laser ranging and the Sagnac interferometry. We demonstrate that Sagnac observable is a mission enabling and allows to measure the angular frequency of the tetrahedral rotation with respect to an inertial reference frame with an accuracy much higher than that available from any other modern navigational techniques. We show that the quality of the science measurements is affected by the changes in tetrahedron's orientation and shape as spacecraft follow their orbits. We present the preliminary mission and instrument requirements needed to measure the trace[GGT] to the required accuracy and demonstrate the feasibility of satisfying the science objectives.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Polarized Solar Corona during the Annular Eclipse of October 14, 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 2023 October 14, using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph "CATEcor" builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a "shaded-truss" externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R$_\odot$ during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for AGILE Anticoincidence System's Background Prediction from Orbital and Attitude Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) space mission launched in 2007 to study X-ray and gamma-ray phenomena in the energy range from $\sim$20 keV to $\sim$10 GeV. The AGILE AntiCoincidence System (ACS) detects hard-X photons in the 50 - 200 keV energy range and continuously stores each panel's count rates in the telemetry. We developed a new Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the background of the AGILE ACS top panel using the satellite's orbital and attitude parameters. This model aims to learn how the orbital and spinning modulations of the satellite impact the background level of the ACS top panel. The DL model executes a regression problem, and is trained with a supervised learning technique on a dataset larger than twenty million orbital parameters' configurations. Using a test dataset, we evaluated the trained model by comparison of the predicted count rates with the real ones. The results show that the model can reconstruct the background count rates of the ACS top panel with an accuracy of 96.7\%, considering the orbital modulation and spinning of the satellite. Starting from these promising results, we are developing an anomaly detection method to detect Gamma-ray Bursts when the differences between predicted and real count rates exceed a predefined threshold.</description>

      <title>Out-of-focus holography at the Effelsberg telescope</title>

Abstract: Out-of-focus (OOF) holography can be used to determine aperture deformations of radio telescopes that lead to errors in the phase of the complex aperture distribution. In contrast to traditional methods, OOF holography can be performed without a reference antenna, which has a number of practical advantages. The aim of this work is to develop a standard procedure for OOF holography at the Effelsberg telescope. This includes performing OOF holography observations and the development of a dedicated software, the pyoof package, to compute aberrations of the telescope's optical system. Based on the OOF holography method developed at the Green Bank telescope, we adapted the approach to the Effelsberg 100-m telescope in order to determine the aberrations of the aperture phase distribution (phase-error maps). The developed OOF holography software is presented as well as the results from observations at Effelsberg. Early results reveal gravitationally-caused residual deformation not contained in the previously existing aperture and pointing model, and hence we propose to make changes to the model to counteract aberrations in the telescope's surface. The OOF holography method (observations and pyoof package) works as expected at the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and is able to validate the good performance of the existing finite element model. Test measurements show that slight improvements of the aperture efficiency and gain elevation dependence are possible but limited in the current configuration.</description>

      <title>Rapid Spectral Parameter Prediction for Black Hole X-Ray Binaries using Physicalised Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) offer insights into extreme gravitational environments and the testing of general relativity. The X-ray spectrum collected by NICER offers valuable information on the properties and behaviour of BHBs through spectral fitting. However, traditional spectral fitting methods are slow and scale poorly with model complexity. This paper presents a new semi-supervised autoencoder neural network for parameter prediction and spectral reconstruction of BHBs, showing an improvement of up to a factor of 2,700 in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy. The approach maps the spectral features from the numerous outbursts catalogued by NICER and generalises them to new systems for efficient and accurate spectral fitting. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the spectral fitting of BHBs and holds promise for use in other areas of astronomy and physics for categorising large datasets.</description>

      <title>A Configurable Ultra-Low Noise Current Source for Transition-Edge Sensor Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensors (TESs) are sensitive devices for detecting photons from millimeter radiation to gamma rays. Their photon counting efficiency and collecting area benefit from large-array multiplexing scheme, and therefore the development of multiplexing readout system has been an important topic in this field. Among the many multiplex techniques, time-division multiplexing (TDM) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) has been used most widely for TES readout. In this work, we design a Configurable Ultra-Low Noise Current Source (CLCS) for TES characterization and as a part of a whole TDM-TES bias control system. The CLCS is based on the feedback structure of ultra-low noise instrumentation amplifiers and low-noise, high-resolution (20 bits) digital-to-analog converter (DAC). CLCS has an ultra-high resolution of 10 nA in the 0 to 5 mA current output range, and can perform current-voltage (IV) sweep and bias-step tests to measure key TES parameters on board. The feedback structure of the CLCS also avoids the issue of impedance mismatch.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirement for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observation -- III. Bias and variance in uGMRT ELAIS-N1 field power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power spectrum of \HI 21-cm radiation is one of the promising probes to study large scale structure of the universe and understand galaxy formation and evolution. The presence of foregrounds, that are orders of magnitude larger in the same frequency range of the redshifted 21-cm signal has been one of the largest observational challenges. The foreground contamination also hinders the calibration procedures and introduces residual calibration errors in the interferometric data. It has been shown that the calibration errors can introduce bias in the 21-cm power spectrum estimates and introduce additional systematics. In this work, we assess the efficacy of 21-cm power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT Band-3 observations of the ELAIS-N1 field. We first evaluate the statistics of the residual gain errors and perform additional flagging based on these statistics. We then use an analytical method to estimate the bias and variance in the power spectrum. We found that (a) the additional flagging based on calibration accuracy help reduce the bias and systematics in the power spectrum, (b) the majority of the systematics at the lower angular scales, $\ell &lt; 6000$, are due to the residual gain errors, (c) for the uGMRT baseline configuration and system parameters, the variance is always higher than the bias in the power spectrum estimates. Based on our analysis we observe that for an angular multipole of $\ell \sim3000$, $2000$ hours of `on source time' is required with the uGMRT to detect redshifted 21-cm signal at $3-\sigma$ significance from a redshift of $2.55$. In this work we only consider the power spectrum measurement in the plane of the sky, an assessment of residual gain statistics and its effect on multifrequency angular power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT and the SKA like telescopes will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>VaTEST III: Validation of 8 Potential Super-Earths from TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NASA's all-sky survey mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), is specifically engineered to detect exoplanets that transit bright stars. Thus far, TESS has successfully identified approximately 400 transiting exoplanets, in addition to roughly 6000 candidate exoplanets pending confirmation. In this study, we present the results of our ongoing project, the Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST). Our dedicated effort is focused on the confirmation and characterization of new exoplanets through the application of statistical validation tools. Through a combination of ground-based telescope data, high-resolution imaging, and the utilization of the statistical validation tool known as \texttt{TRICERATOPS}, we have successfully discovered eight potential super-Earths. These planets bear the designations: TOI-238b (1.61$^{+0.09} _{-0.10}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-771b (1.42$^{+0.11} _{-0.09}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-871b (1.66$^{+0.11} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1467b (1.83$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1739b (1.69$^{+0.10} _{-0.08}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-2068b (1.82$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-4559b (1.42$^{+0.13} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), and TOI-5799b (1.62$^{+0.19} _{-0.13}$ R$_\oplus$). Among all these planets, six of them fall within the region known as 'keystone planets,' which makes them particularly interesting for study. Based on the location of TOI-771b and TOI-4559b below the radius valley we characterized them as likely super-Earths, though radial velocity mass measurements for these planets will provide more details about their characterization. It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the evolutionary stages between Earth and Neptune.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neonlike Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity-equivalent +/- ~5 km/s in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a ten-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Case Study in the Misidentification of Starlink Satellites as UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>
