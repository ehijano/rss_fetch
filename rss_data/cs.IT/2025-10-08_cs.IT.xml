      <title>Encoded Jamming Secure Communication for RIS-Assisted and ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a cooperative jamming (CJ)-aided secure wireless communication system. Conventionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN) to enhance security; however, the GN scheme also degrades the legitimate receiver's performance. Encoded jamming (EJ) mitigates this interference but does not always outperform GN under varying channel conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with EJ to maximize the secrecy rate. In the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, we adopt a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based alternating optimization method, while in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm based on the weighted sum mean-square-error minimization (WMMSE) scheme. Furthermore, we are the first to incorporate EJ into an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, characterizing the Pareto boundary between secrecy rate and sensing mutual information (MI) by solving the resulting joint optimization problem using a modified WMMSE-based algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform benchmark methods in secrecy rate across diverse channel conditions and clearly reveal the trade-off between security and sensing.</description>

      <title>On Binary Codes That Are Maximal Totally Isotropic Subspaces with Respect to an Alternating Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-dual binary linear codes have been extensively studied and classified for length n &lt;= 40. However, little attention has been paid to linear codes that coincide with their orthogonal complement when the underlying inner product is not the dot product. In this paper, we introduce an alternating form defined on F_2^n and study codes that are maximal totally isotropic with repsect to this form. We classify such codes for n &lt;= 24 and present a MacWilliams-type identity which relates the weight enumerator of a linear code and that of its orthogonal complement with respect to our alternating inner product. As an application, we derive constraints on the weight enumerators of maximal totally isotropic codes.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Estimation via Score-to-Fisher Bridge for Nonlinear Gaussian Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method to evaluate mutual information (MI) in nonlinear Gaussian noise channels by using denoising score matching learning for estimating the score function of channel output. Via de Bruijn identity and the I--MMSE relation, Fisher information estimated from the learned score yields accurate estimates of MI through an integral representation of MI for a variety of priors and channel nonlinearities (e.g., elementwise nonlinearity). In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the Score-to-Fisher bridge methodology, along with practical guidelines for its implementation. We also conduct extensive validation experiments, comparing our approach with closed-form solutions and a kernel density estimation baseline. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is both practical and efficient for mutual information estimation in nonlinear Gaussian noise channels.</description>

      <title>Channel Simulation and Distributed Compression with Ensemble Rejection Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study channel simulation and distributed matching, two fundamental problems with several applications to machine learning, using a recently introduced generalization of the standard rejection sampling (RS) algorithm known as Ensemble Rejection Sampling (ERS). For channel simulation, we propose a new coding scheme based on ERS that achieves a near-optimal coding rate. In this process, we demonstrate that standard RS can also achieve a near-optimal coding rate and generalize the result of Braverman and Garg (2014) to the continuous alphabet setting. Next, as our main contribution, we present a distributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling counterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam (2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma (Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed matching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching probability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our approach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>SALAD: Self-Adaptive Link Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to the wireless link quality is critical for maximizing spectral efficiency while ensuring reliability. We propose SALAD (self-adaptive link adaptation), an algorithm that exclusively leverages ACK/NACK feedback to reliably track the evolution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), achieving high spectral efficiency while keeping the long-term block error rate (BLER) near a desired target. SALAD infers the SINR by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between received ACK/NACKs and predicted BLER values, with a learning rate that self-adapts online through knowledge distillation. Based on this inference, SALAD selects the MCS via hypothesis testing: if the SINR is likely underestimated, a higher MCS is selected to accelerate link adaptation under improving channel conditions. To prevent BLER drift from its long-term target, SALAD incorporates a feedback control loop that adjusts the instantaneous BLER target. Over-the-air experiments on a 5G testbed demonstrate that SALAD consistently outperforms the industry-standard outer-loop link adaptation (OLLA). With a single set of parameters, SALAD achieves up to 15% higher throughput and spectral efficiency than multiple OLLA variants across different traffic regimes, while meeting the BLER target.</description>

      <title>Risk level dependent Minimax Quantile lower bounds for Interactive Statistical Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimax risk and regret focus on expectation, missing rare failures critical in safety-critical bandits and reinforcement learning. Minimax quantiles capture these tails. Three strands of prior work motivate this study: minimax-quantile bounds restricted to non-interactive estimation; unified interactive analyses that focus on expected risk rather than risk level specific quantile bounds; and high-probability bandit bounds that still lack a quantile-specific toolkit for general interactive protocols. To close this gap, within the interactive statistical decision making framework, we develop high-probability Fano and Le Cam tools and derive risk level explicit minimax-quantile bounds, including a quantile-to-expectation conversion and a tight link between strict and lower minimax quantiles. Instantiating these results for the two-armed Gaussian bandit immediately recovers optimal-rate bounds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on communication, radar search, and tracking task scheduling in multi-cell integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks under quality of service (QoS) constraints. We propose a medium access control framework multiplexing the tasks while optimizing radar scan patterns through an interference-aware assignment formulation. Simulations show that our solution guarantees target QoS with improved resource efficiency over baseline schemes, highlighting the benefits of coordinated scheduling in multi-cell ISAC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}$ be a finite commutative chain ring of even characteristic with maximal ideal $\langle u \rangle$ of nilpotency index $e \geq 2,$ Teichm$\ddot{u}$ller set $\mathcal{T}_{m},$ and residue field $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}/\langle u \rangle$ of order $2^m.$ Suppose that $2 \in \langle u^{\kappa}\rangle \setminus \langle u^{\kappa+1}\rangle$ for some even positive integer $ \kappa \leq e.$ In this paper, we provide a recursive method to construct a self-orthogonal code $\mathcal{C}_e$ of type $\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_e\}$ and length $n$ over $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}$ from a chain $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}\subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(2)} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{D}^{(\lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil)}$ of self-orthogonal codes of length $n$ over $\mathcal{T}_{m},$ and vice versa, where $\dim \mathcal{D}^{(i)}=\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\cdots+\lambda_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq \lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil,$ the codes $\mathcal{D}^{(\lfloor \frac{e+1}{2} \rfloor-\kappa)},\mathcal{D}^{(\lfloor \frac{e+1}{2} \rfloor -\kappa+1)},\ldots,\mathcal{D}^{(\lfloor \frac{e}{2}\rfloor-\lfloor \frac{\kappa}{2} \rfloor)}$ satisfy certain additional conditions, and $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_e$ are non-negative integers satisfying $2\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+\cdots+2\lambda_{e-i+1}+\lambda_{e-i+2}+\lambda_{e-i+3}+\cdots+\lambda_i \leq n$ for $\lceil \frac{e+1}{2} \rceil \leq i\leq e.$ This construction guarantees that $Tor_i(\mathcal{C}_e)=\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$ for $1 \leq i \leq \lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil.$ By employing this recursive construction method, together with the results from group theory and finite geometry, we derive explicit enumeration formulae for all self-orthogonal and self-dual codes of an arbitrary length over $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}.$ We also demonstrate these results through examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{R}_{e,m}$ denote a finite commutative chain ring of even characteristic with maximal ideal $\langle u \rangle$ of nilpotency index $e \geq 3,$ Teichm$\ddot{u}$ller set $\mathcal{T}_{m},$ and residue field $\mathscr{R}_{e,m}/\langle u \rangle$ of order $2^m.$ Suppose that $2 \in \langle u^{\kappa}\rangle \setminus \langle u^{\kappa+1}\rangle$ for some odd integer $\kappa$ with $3 \leq \kappa \leq e.$ In this paper, we first develop a recursive method to construct a self-orthogonal code $\mathscr{D}_e$ of type $\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_e\}$ and length $n$ over $\mathscr{R}_{e,m}$ from a chain $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}\subseteq \mathcal{C}^{(2)} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{C}^{(\lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil)} $ of self-orthogonal codes of length $n$ over $\mathcal{T}_{m},$ and vice versa, subject to certain conditions, where $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_e$ are non-negative integers satisfying $2\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+\cdots+2\lambda_{e-i+1}+\lambda_{e-i+2}+\lambda_{e-i+3}+\cdots+\lambda_i \leq n$ for $\lceil \frac{e+1}{2} \rceil \leq i\leq e,$ and
  $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ and $\lceil \cdot \rceil$ denote the floor and ceiling functions, respectively. This construction ensures that $Tor_i(\mathscr{D}_e)=\mathcal{C}^{(i)}$ for $1 \leq i \leq \lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil.$
  With the help of this recursive construction method and by applying results from group theory and finite geometry, we obtain explicit enumeration formulae for all self-orthogonal and self-dual codes of an arbitrary length over $\mathscr{R}_{e,m}.$ We also illustrate these results with some examples.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Guarantees to Explicit Constructions: Local Properties of Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for derandomizing random linear codes with respect to a broad class of permutation-invariant properties, known as local properties, which encompass several standard notions such as distance, list-decoding, list-recovery, and perfect hashing. Our approach extends the classical Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) construction through a modified formalism of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, introduced by Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (2025). The main theorem demonstrates that if random linear codes satisfy the complement of an LCL property $\mathcal{P}$ with high probability, then one can construct explicit codes satisfying the complement of $\mathcal{P}$ as well, with an enlarged yet constant alphabet size. This gives the first explicit constructions for list recovery, as well as special cases (e.g., list recovery with erasures, zero-error list recovery, perfect hash matrices), with parameters matching those of random linear codes. More broadly, our constructions realize the full range of parameters associated with these properties at the same level of optimality as in the random setting, thereby offering a systematic pathway from probabilistic guarantees to explicit codes that attain them. Furthermore, our derandomization of random linear codes also admits efficient (list) decoding via recently developed expander-based decoders.</description>

      <title>Functional Connectivity Networks for Transportation Delay Analysis: from Theory to Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the endeavour of modelling and understanding the propagation of delays in transportation networks, an approach that has attracted increasing interest in the last decade is the creation of functional network representations. These graphs map elements of interest (e.g. airports or stations) as nodes, and derive pairwise propagation patterns from their dynamics through correlation and causality tests. In spite of multiple notable results, this approach still lacks a coherent framework, with decisions related to many fundamental steps being left to the judgement of the researcher. We here provide an introduction to the theory behind functional networks for transportation systems, detailing the main steps and the associated pitfalls. We further introduce a Python package, delaynet, designed to support the researcher in the reconstruction and analysis of such networks. We finally present an analysis of the propagation of delays in the Swiss train system; and discuss future research steps.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Information-Theoretic Perspective on the Symbol Grounding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Algorithm for KL Divergence Estimation with Quantitative Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables, traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number of samples.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Continual Learning with Gradient Descent for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning, the ability of a model to adapt to an ongoing sequence of tasks without forgetting the earlier ones, is a central goal of artificial intelligence. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, we analyze the limitations of continual learning in a tractable yet representative setting. In particular, we study one-hidden-layer quadratic neural networks trained by gradient descent on an XOR cluster dataset with Gaussian noise, where different tasks correspond to different clusters with orthogonal means. Our results obtain bounds on the rate of forgetting during train and test-time in terms of the number of iterations, the sample size, the number of tasks, and the hidden-layer size. Our results reveal interesting phenomena on the role of different problem parameters in the rate of forgetting. Numerical experiments across diverse setups confirm our results, demonstrating their validity beyond the analyzed settings.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Policy Pre-Training with Empowerment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL.</description>

      <title>TelecomTS: A Multi-Modal Observability Dataset for Time Series and Language Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated, highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt, noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale information for practical observability applications.</description>

      <title>Power-divergence copulas: A new class of Archimedean copulas, with an insurance application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that, under a particular convention, the convex functions that characterise the phi divergences also generate Archimedean copulas in at least two dimensions. As a special case, we develop the family of Archimedean copulas associated with the important family of power divergences, which we call the power-divergence copulas. The properties of the family are extensively studied, including the subfamilies that are absolutely continuous or have a singular component, the ordering of the family, limiting cases (i.e., the Frechet-Hoeffding lower bound and Frechet-Hoeffding upper bound), the Kendall's tau and tail-dependence coefficients, and cases that extend to three or more dimensions. In an illustrative application, the power-divergence copulas are used to model a Danish fire insurance dataset. It is shown that the power-divergence copulas provide an adequate fit to the bivariate distribution of two kinds of fire-related losses claimed by businesses, while several benchmarks (a suite of well known Archimedean, extreme-value, and elliptical copulas) do not.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for study. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Causal Coordination for Distributed Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized network control, communication plays a critical role by transforming local observations into shared knowledge, enabling agents to coordinate their actions. This paper investigates how communication facilitates cooperation behavior and therefore improves the overall performance in the vector-valued Witsenhausen counterexample, a canonical toy example in distributed decision-making. We consider setups where the encoder, i.e., the first decision-maker (DM) acts causally and the decoder, i.e., the second DM, operates noncausally, 1) without and 2) with access to channel feedback. Using a coordination coding framework, we characterize the achievable power-estimation cost regions in single-letter expressions for both scenarios. The first result is that, when restricted to Gaussian random variables, the cost is identical across all setups featuring at least one causal DM - regardless of the presence of feedback information. Next, building on the characterization of the power-estimation cost region, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines discrete quantization with a continuous Gaussian codebook - the Zero Estimation Cost (ZEC) scheme - which achieves an arbitrarily small estimation cost. This scheme uses coding tools that allow perfect reconstruction of the target symbols, leading to an asymptotic estimation cost equal to zero, while significantly reducing the asymptotic power consumption. Furthermore, when channel feedback is available at the first DM, we propose an analogous scheme that simultaneously achieves zero power and zero estimation cost in the low-noise regime.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for the Alignments of Partially Correlated Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence between two correlated random graphs. We propose the partially correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model, wherein a pair of induced subgraphs with a certain number are correlated. We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering the latent correlated subgraphs and the hidden vertex correspondence. We prove that there exists an optimal rate for partial recovery for the number of correlated nodes, above which one can correctly match a fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, and we also derive an optimal rate for exact recovery. In the proof of possibility results, we propose correlated functional digraphs, which partition the edges of the intersection graph into two types of components, and bound the error probability by lower-order cumulant generating functions. The proof of impossibility results build upon the generalized Fano's inequality and the recovery thresholds settled in correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced BICM Receivers for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Short Packet Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents enhanced receiver metrics for joint estimation-detection in short blocklength transmissions, addressing scenarios with unknown channel state information and low or sparse training resource density. We show that it is possible to enhance the performance and sensitivity through block-wise joint estimation-detection compared to standard receivers. The performance analysis makes use of a full 5G transmitter and receiver chains for both Polar and LDPC coded transmissions paired with QPSK modulation scheme. We consider transmissions where reference signals are interleaved with coded data and both are transmitted over a small number of OFDM symbols so that near-perfect channel estimation cannot be achieved. Unlike conventional symbol-by-symbol detection in BICM systems, where the observation for a given coded bit is confined to the symbol in which it is conveyed,the proposed method performs block-wise joint detection over a sliding window of adjacent symbols to fundamentally leverages their statistical dependencies. Accordingly, the LLR for a particular coded bit incorporates information from all symbols within the detection window, rather than being constrained to its host symbol alone. Performance evaluation spans SIMO and SU-MIMO configurations, emphasizing the efficacy of the estimation-detection strategy in realistic base station receiver scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that when the detection windows used in the metric units are on the order of four modulated symbols, the proposed receivers remarkably outperform the conventional ones and can be used to achieve detection performance that is close to that of coherent receivers with perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi divergence-based uniformity guarantees for $k$-universal hash functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal hash functions map the output of a source to random strings over a finite alphabet, aiming to approximate the uniform distribution on the set of strings. A classic result on these functions, called the Leftover Hash Lemma, gives an estimate of the distance from uniformity based on the assumptions about the min-entropy of the source. We prove several results concerning extensions of this lemma to a class of functions that are $k^\ast$-universal, i.e., $l$-universal for all $2\le l\le k$. As a common distinctive feature, our results provide estimates of closeness to uniformity in terms of the $\alpha$-R{\'e}nyi divergence for all $\alpha\in (1,\infty]$. For $1\le \alpha\le k$ we show that it is possible to convert all the randomness of the source measured in $\alpha$-\Renyi entropy into approximately uniform bits with nearly the same amount of randomness. For large enough $k$ we show that it is possible to distill random bits that are nearly uniform, as measured by min-entropy. We also extend these results to hashing with side information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm to design rate- and length-flexible polar codes. While the algorithm is very general, a particularly appealing use case is the design of codes for automorphism ensemble decoding (AED), a promising decoding algorithm for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) applications. To this end, theoretic results on nesting of symmetric polar codes are derived, which give hope in finding a fully nested, rate-compatible sequence suitable for AED. Using the proposed algorithms, such a flexible polar code design for automorphism ensemble successive cancellation (SC) decoding is constructed, outperforming existing code designs for AED and also the 5G polar code under cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-aided successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.</description>

Abstract: We study the private online change detection problem for dynamic communities, using a censored block model (CBM). We consider edge differential privacy (DP) in both local and central settings, and propose joint change detection and community estimation procedures for both scenarios. We seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between the privacy budget, detection delay, and exact community recovery of community labels. Further, we provide theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of our proposed method by showing necessary and sufficient conditions for change detection and exact recovery under edge DP. Simulation and real data examples are provided to validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Supervised Contrastive learning: A Projection Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However, supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods. Extensive experiments on image and audio datasets demonstrate that ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary perspectives--information-theoretic and projection viewpoints--and offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the foundational contrastive objective.</description>

Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

Abstract: In this short article, I would like to briefly summarize my research in the first 5 years in my university academia life in USA. I think that my research results obtained in these 5 years are the best in my career, at least which I like the most by myself. I wish that my experience in my junior academia career could be of some help to young researchers.</description>
