      <title>A consistent diffuse-interface finite element approach to rapid melt--vapor dynamics in metal additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing via laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) faces performance-critical challenges due to complex melt pool and vapor dynamics, often oversimplified by computational models that neglect crucial aspects, such as vapor jet formation. To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid--vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier--Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid--vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model's ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) remains a fundamental challenge with significant implications for the development of new materials and the advancement of various scientific disciplines. Recent developments have shown that generative models, particularly diffusion models, hold great promise for CSP. However, traditional graph-based representations, where atomic bonds are modeled as pairwise graph edges, fail to fully capture the intricate high-order interactions essential for accurately representing crystal structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes hypergraphs to represent crystal structures, providing a more expressive abstraction for modeling multi-way atomic interactions. By adopting hypergraphs, we can effectively capture complex high-order relationships and symmetries, such as permutation and periodic translation invariance, which are crucial for characterizing crystal structures. In this work, we propose the \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{Diff}usion Model (\textbf{EH-Diff}), a generative model designed to take advantage of the symmetry-preserving properties of hypergraphs. EH-Diff exploits these features to offer an efficient and accurate method for predicting crystal structures with a strong theoretical justification to preserve invariance properties. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that EH-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art CSP methods with only one sample.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problem for Multi-armed Bandits via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of explicit and semi-explicit immersed boundary finite element methods for wave propagation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersed boundary methods have attracted substantial interest in the last decades due to their potential for computations involving complex geometries. Often these cannot be efficiently discretized using boundary-fitted finite elements. Immersed boundary methods provide a simple and fully automatic discretization based on Cartesian grids and tailored quadrature schemes that account for the geometric model. It can thus be described independently of the grid, e.g., by image data obtained from computed tomography scans. The drawback of such a discretization lies in the potentially small overlap between certain elements in the grid and the geometry. These badly cut elements with small physical support pose a particular challenge for nonlinear and/or dynamic simulations. In this work, we focus on problems in structural dynamics and acoustics and concentrate on solving them with explicit time-marching schemes. In this context, badly cut elements can lead to unfeasibly small critical time step sizes. We investigate the performance of implicit-explicit time marching schemes and two stabilization methods developed in previous works as potential remedies. While these have been studied before with regard to their effectiveness in increasing the critical time step size, their numerical efficiency has only been considered in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom. In this paper, we evaluate the computation time required for a given accuracy, which depends not only on the number of degrees of freedom but also on the selected spatial discretization, the sparsity patterns of the system matrices, and the employed time-marching scheme.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Financial Fraud Detection with Cloud-Optimized Real-Time Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the financial industry becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital systems, fraud detection systems must evolve to meet growing threats. Cloud-enabled Transformer models present a transformative opportunity to address these challenges. By leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and advanced AI capabilities of cloud platforms, companies can deploy fraud detection solutions that adapt to real-time data patterns and proactively respond to evolving threats. Using the Graph self-attention Transformer neural network module, we can directly excavate gang fraud features from the transaction network without constructing complicated feature engineering. Finally, the fraud prediction network is combined to optimize the topological pattern and the temporal transaction pattern to realize the high-precision detection of fraudulent transactions. The results of antifraud experiments on credit card transaction data show that the proposed model outperforms the 7 baseline models on all evaluation indicators: In the transaction fraud detection task, the average accuracy (AP) increased by 20% and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased by 2.7% on average compared with the benchmark graph attention neural network (GAT), which verified the effectiveness of the proposed model in the detection of credit card fraud transactions.</description>

      <title>Human-Precision Medicine Interaction: Public Perceptions of Polygenic Risk Score for Genetic Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision Medicine (PM) transforms the traditional "one-drug-fits-all" paradigm by customising treatments based on individual characteristics, and is an emerging topic for HCI research on digital health. A key element of PM, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), uses genetic data to predict an individual's disease risk. Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identified ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed design implications for a responsible PRS framework. To address the complexities of PRS and enhance broader PM practices, we introduce the term Human-Precision Medicine Interaction (HPMI), which integrates, adapts, and extends HCI approaches to better meet these challenges.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Alternatives of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores alternative formulations of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) as a foundation for neural network design. The original KST formulation, while mathematically elegant, presents practical challenges due to its limited insight into the structure of inner and outer functions and the large number of unknown variables it introduces. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) leverage KST for function approximation, but they have faced scrutiny due to mixed results compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and practical limitations imposed by the original KST formulation. To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes many of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches. These results present ActNet as a promising new direction for KST-based deep learning applications, particularly in scientific computing and PDE simulation tasks.</description>
