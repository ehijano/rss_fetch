      <title>Localization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of $n\times n$ random band matrices with bandwidth $W$. When $W^2\ll n$, we prove that with high probability the eigenvectors of such matrices are localized and decay exponentially at the sharp scale $W^2$. Combined with the delocalization results of Erd\H{o}s and Riabov [arXiv:2506.06441], and Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718], this establishes the conjectured localization-delocalization transition for a large class of random band matrices.</description>

      <title>Distribution Dependent Birth-Death Processes: $\mathbb{W}_p$-Estimate, Ergodicity and Propagation of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of time inhomogenous distribution dependent birth-death processes, we derive the well-posedness, $\mathbb{W}_p$-estimate, exponential ergodicity, and uniform in time propagation of chaos. These extend the corresponding results derived for distribution dependent SDEs and mean field particle systems. As preparation, a criterion on the well-posedness of inhomogenous jump process is presented in the end of the paper, which should be interesting by itself.</description>

      <title>Tanaka formula for SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Tanaka-type formula for the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter $H &gt; \frac{1}{2}$. While Tanaka formulas for the fractional Brownian motion itself have been established, a corresponding result for non-linear SDEs driven by fBm has so far been unavailable. Our formula reveals a structure not previously observed: it features both a Skorokhod integral and a Malliavin trace correction, where the analogue of the local time appears through a double integral involving the Dirac distribution and the Malliavin derivative of the solution. A second double integral captures the variation of the diffusion coefficient along the flow. A key step in our analysis is a novel method to establish $L^2$-convergence of the trace term, which avoids the use of white noise calculus and instead exploits Gaussian-type density estimates for the law of the solution. The result applies to a broad class of equations under suitable regularity assumptions and extends naturally to convex functionals. As special cases, we recover known identities for the fractional Brownian motion and the fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>A short proof of free energy limit of two spin spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model at any temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a short proof of the limit of free energy of spherical 2 spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model without external field. This proof works for all temperatures and is based on the Laplace method of integration and considering a discrete approximation of the whole space. This proof is general enough and can be adapted to any interaction matrix where the eigenvalue distribution has some nice properties. The proof in the high-temperature case is the same as the proof given in [BK19]. However, the low-temperature case is new.</description>

      <title>The convex structure of the Parisi formula for multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free energy of mean-field multi-species spin glasses with convex covariance function. For such models with $D$ species, the Parisi formula is known to be valid, and expresses the limit free energy as a supremum over monotone probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$. We show here that one can transform this representation into a supremum over all probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$ of a concave functional. We then deduce that the Parisi formula admits a unique maximizer. Using convex-duality arguments, we also obtain a new representation of the free energy as an infimum over martingales in a Wiener space.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-normalized concentration of vector-valued stochastic processes. We focus on bounds for sub-$\psi$ processes, a tail condition that encompasses a wide variety of well-known distributions (including sub-exponential, sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, and sub-Poisson distributions). Our results recover and generalize the influential bound of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011) and fill a gap in the literature between determinant-based bounds and those based on condition numbers. As applications we prove a Bernstein inequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (which is more general than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free, self-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the variational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.</description>

      <title>A note on the singularity conjecture for infinite covolume discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on semisimple Lie groups where the support of the step distribution generates (as a group) a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. When the semisimple Lie group has property (T), we show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. This result does not require any condition on the moment or symmetry of the step distribution. When the semisimple Lie group has rank one and the step distribution has a finite first moment, we again show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. For general semisimple Lie groups, we also obtain a sufficient condition for the singularity of the stationary measure and a general Patterson-Sullivan measure.</description>

      <title>Averages of hypergraphs and higher arity stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that $k$-ary functions giving the measure of the intersection of multi-parametric families of sets in probability spaces, e.g. $(x,y,z) \in X \times Y \times Z \mapsto \mu(P_{x,y} \cap Q_{x,z} \cap R_{y,z})$, satisfy a particularly strong form of hypergraph regularity. More generally, this applies to the (integral) averages of continuous combinations of functions of smaller arity. This result is connected to higher arity stability in model theory, that we discuss in the second part of the paper. We demonstrate that all hypergraphs embedding both into the half-simplex and into $GS(\mathbb{F}_3)$, the two known sources of failure of ternary stability, do satisfy an analogous regularity lemma -- hence strong ternary stability cannot be characterized simply by excluded hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>

      <title>A Time Series Model for Three Asset Classes used in Financial Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for annual returns of three asset classes: the USA Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) stock index, the international stock index, and the USA Bank of America investment-grade corporate bond index. Using this, we made an online financial app simulating wealth process. This includes options for regular withdrawals and contributions. Four factors are: S&amp;P volatility and earnings, corporate BAA rate, and long-short Treasury bond spread. Our valuation measure is an improvement of Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio. We use classic linear regression models, and make residuals white noise by dividing by annual volatility. We use multivariate kernel density estimation for residuals. We state and prove long-term stability results.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Driven Instant Review: Confident Detection and Reconstruction of LLM Plagiarism on PC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetric random walks on discrete, Zariski-dense subgroups $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ with Property (T). We prove that if $\Gamma$ has infinite covolume, then the associated hitting measure on the Furstenberg boundary of $G$ is singular. This is in contrast to Furstenberg's discretization of Brownian motion to lattices, and it is the first result of this type when $G$ has higher rank.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) in the context of quantum Markov semigroups that generalizes the one of quasi-stationary distribution in the case of classical Markov chains. We provide an operational interpretation of QSSs using the theory of direct and indirect quantum measurements. Moreover, we prove that there is a connection between QSSs and spectral properties of the quantum Markov semigroup. Finally, we discuss some examples which, despite their simplicity, already show interesting features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sticky diffusion models a Markovian particle experiencing reflection and temporary adhesion phenomena at the boundary. Numerous numerical schemes exist for approximating stopped or reflected stochastic differential equations (SDEs), but this is not the case for sticky SDEs. In this paper, we construct and analyze half-order and first-order numerical schemes for the weak approximation of stochastic differential equations with sticky boundary conditions. We present the algorithms in general setting such that they can be used to solve general linear parabolic partial differential equations with second-order sticky boundary condition via the probabilistic representations of their solutions. Since the sticky diffusion spends non-zero amount of time on boundary, it poses extra challenge in designing the schemes and obtaining their order of convergence. We support the theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>The maximal displacement of radially symmetric branching random walk in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider discrete-time branching random walks with a radially symmetric distribution. Independently of each other individuals generate offspring whose relative locations are given by a copy of a radially symmetric point process $\mathcal{L}$. The number of particles at time $t$ form a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We investigate the maximal distance to the origin of such branching random walks. Conditioned on survival, we show that, under some assumptions on $\mathcal{L}$, it grows in the same way as for branching Brownian motion or a broad class of one-dimensional branching random walks: the first term is linear in time and the second logarithmic. The constants in front of these terms are explicit and depend only on the mean measure of $\mathcal{L}$ and dimension. Our main tool in the proof is a ballot theorem with moving barrier which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a duration-dependent life insurance model, we consider continuous-time semi-Markov jump processes, initially assumed to have a finite state-space. We develop approximations using jump processes that are time-homogeneous Markov, conditioned on a high-intensity Poissonian grid (grid-conditional). Our results are based on a recent adaptation of the uniformization principle, which yields a strongly pathwise convergent sequence of jump processes. In contrast to traditional methods that use classical approximations to integro-differential equation solutions to compute value functions, our approximations result in easily implementable expressions, making them valuable in situations where evaluating pathwise distributional functionals for the original semi-Markov process is challenging. Our homogeneous approximation, initially grid-conditional, evolves into an unconditional version that remains effective under reasonable regularity assumptions. We then relax the finite state-space assumption and show how our results can be extended to a general measurable state-space. We illustrate the practicality of our approach with a disability insurance model, using realistic underlying semi-Markov process parameters.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the infinite cluster and the cluster density in the Poisson driven random connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random connection model (RCM) on a general space driven by a Poisson process whose intensity measure is scaled by a parameter $t\ge 0$. We say that the infinite clusters are deletion stable if the removal of a Poisson point cannot split a cluster in two or more infinite clusters. We prove that this stability together with a natural irreducibility assumption implies uniqueness of the infinite cluster. Conversely, if the infinite cluster is unique then this stability property holds. Several criteria for irreducibility will be established. We also study the analytic properties of expectations of functions of clusters as a function of $t$. In particular we show that the position dependent cluster density is differentiable. A significant part of this paper is devoted to the important case of a stationary marked RCM (in Euclidean space), containing the Boolean model with general compact grains and the so-called weighted RCM as special cases. In this case we establish differentiability and a convexity property of the cluster density $\kappa(t)$. These properties are crucial for our proof of deletion stability of the infinite clusters but are also of interest in their own right. It then follows that an irreducible stationary marked RCM can have at most one infinite cluster. This extends and unifies several results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hoeffding and Bernstein inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish Hoeffding and Bernstein type concentration inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables. A special case is the i.i.d. setting, where random variables are sampled independently from some distribution (and are therefore exchangeable). In contrast to the existing literature on this problem, our results provide a natural unified view of both the i.i.d. and the exchangeable setting.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic estimates for accelerated high order Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, namely, aHOLA and aHOLLA, to sample from high-dimensional target distributions with possibly super-linearly growing potentials. We establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for aHOLA in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances with rates of convergence equal to $1+q/2$ and $1/2+q/4$, respectively, under a local H\"{o}lder condition with exponent $q\in(0,1]$ and a convexity at infinity condition on the potential of the target distribution. Similar results are obtained for aHOLLA under certain global continuity conditions and a dissipativity condition. Crucially, we achieve state-of-the-art rates of convergence of the proposed algorithms in the non-convex setting which are higher than those of the existing algorithms. Examples from high-dimensional sampling and logistic regression are presented, and numerical results support our main findings.</description>

      <title>Proximal optimal transport divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12097</link>

Abstract: We introduce the proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulations and adversarial learning. The proximal operator associated with the proximal optimal transport divergence can be interpreted as a transport map that pushes a reference distribution toward the optimal generative distribution, which approximates the target distribution that is only accessible through data samples. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of classical optimal transport, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward continuity equation. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributionally robust optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity Conditions for Critical Point Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on a sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$, defined on a compact manifold with boundary $S$, converging in the $C^k$ metric to a limit $f$. A common assumption implicitly made in the empirical sciences is that when such functions represent random processes derived from data, the topological features of $f_n$ will eventually resemble those of $f$. In this work, we investigate the validity of this claim under various regularity assumptions, with the goal of finding conditions sufficient for the number of local maxima, minima and saddle of such functions to converge. In the $C^1$ setting, we do so by employing lesser-known variants of the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf and mountain pass theorems, and in the $C^2$ setting we pursue an approach inspired by the homotopy-based proof of the Morse Lemma. To aid practical use, we end by reformulating our central theorems in the language of the empirical processes.</description>
