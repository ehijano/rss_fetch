      <title>A new proof of Chen's theorem for Markoff graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Chen proved a congruence for the degree of a certain map on the space of covers of elliptic curves. He concluded as a corollary that the size of any connected component of the Markoff mod $p$ graph is divisible by $p$. In combination with the work of Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak, Chen's result proves a conjecture of Baragar for all but finitely many primes: the Markoff mod $p$ graph is connected. In this note, we provide an alternative proof for the Markoff corollary of Chen's theorem.</description>

      <title>Completely decomposable modular Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use recently developed algorithms and a new database of modular curves constructed for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database to enumerate completely decomposable modular Jacobians of level N &lt; 240. In particular, we find examples in 13 previously unknown genera of Jacobian varieties isogenous to a product of elliptic curves over Q. The new genera are: 38, 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 113, 135, 137, 157, 159, 169, and 409.</description>

      <title>On a rigidity property for quadratic Gauss sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a large prime and let $c &gt; 1/4$. We prove that if $f$ is a $\pm 1$-valued completely multiplicative function, such that the exponential sums $$ S_f(a) := \sum_{1 \leq n &lt; N} f(n) e(na/N), \quad a \pmod{N} $$ satisfy the ``Gauss sum-like'' approximate dilation symmetry property $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{a \pmod{N}} |S_f(ap) - f(p)S_f(a)|^2 = o(N), $$ uniformly over all primes $p \leq N^c$ then $f$ coincides with a real character modulo $N$ at all but $o(N)$ integers $1 \leq n &lt; N$. As a consequence, taking $f$ to be the Liouville function we connect this exponential sums property to the location of real zeros of $L(s,\chi)$ close to $s = 1$, for $\chi$ the Legendre symbol modulo $N$.
  Assuming the $L$-functions of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo $N$ have a sufficiently wide zero-free region (of Littlewood type), we also show a more general result in which any $c &gt; 0$ may be taken.</description>

      <title>Linnik problem for Maass--Hecke cuspforms and effective multiplicity one theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two related problems concerning the dimension of joint eigenspaces of the Laplace--Beltrami operator and a finite set of Hecke operators on $\mathbb{X}=\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathbb{H}$. First, we consider Linnik problem for Maass--Hecke cuspforms. We prove that the dimension of such a joint eigenspace, for Maass--Hecke cuspforms with eigenparameter in $[T, T+1]$, associated to Hecke operators $T_p$ with $p &lt; (\log T)^\alpha$ is $O_\epsilon (T^{{\frac{4}{\alpha}} + \epsilon})$. For this, we prove a new form of spectral large sieve inequality for symmetric-squares of Maass--Hecke cuspforms, by exploiting the fact that the forms under consideration are unramified at every non-archimedean place.
  Second, we consider the effective multiplicity one problem, determining the minimal number of Hecke eigenvalues needed to distinguish two Maass--Hecke cusp forms with the same Laplace eigenvalue. We prove that for any fixed $\eta&gt;0$, if two Maass--Hecke cuspforms, with eigenparameter $t$, share Hecke eigenvalues $\lambda_{\phi_1}(n) = \lambda_{\phi_2}(n)$ for all $n &lt; \eta t$, and $t$ is sufficiently large, then the forms are proportional. This improves the previously known best bound due to Huntley in 1991. Key ingredient for the improvement is the result by Brook and Lindenstrauss that classifies quantum limits of a joint eigenfunction of a Hecke operator and the Laplace--Beltrami operator on arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces.
  We also discuss generalizations of these results to Maass--Hecke cuspforms on $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ over arbitrary number field.</description>

      <title>The shifted convolution problem in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shifted convolution problem for the divisor function in function fields in the large degree limit, that is, the average value of $d(f) d(f+h)$ where $f$ runs over monic polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ of a given degree, and $h$ is a given monic polynomial. We prove an asymptotic formula in the range $\operatorname{deg}(h) &lt; (2-\epsilon)\operatorname{deg}(f)$. We also consider mixed correlations and self-correlations of $r_\chi = 1 \star \chi$, the convolution of $1$ with a Dirichlet character mod $\ell$, where $\ell$ is a monic irreducible polynomial, proving asymptotic formulae in various ranges. This includes the case of quadratic characters, which yields results about correlations of norm-counting functions of quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. A novel feature of our work is a Voronoi summation formula (equivalently, a functional equation for the Estermann function) in $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ which was not previously available.</description>

      <title>A Markov model for factorization of iterated cubic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Boston and Jones and Goksel, we propose a Markov model for the factorization of PCF cubic polynomials $f$. Using the information encoded in the critical orbits of cubic polynomials, we define a Markov model for PCF cubic polynomials with combined critical orbits of lengths one and two. A complete list of PCF cubic polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$ is available thanks to the work of Anderson et al. Some of these polynomials have been previously studied -- for example, those with colliding critical orbits analyzed by Benedetto et al.; the results from these studies align with our model. We construct groups $M_n$ and prove that they follow our Markov model. These groups $M_n$ are conjectured to contain $\mathrm{Gal}(f^n)$.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness of shapes of unit lattices in totally real cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of the distribution of shapes of unit lattices in number fields, pioneered by Margulis and Gromov, has lately attracted considerable interest, not least because of the lack of available results. Here we prove that the set of shapes of orders of totally real cubic fields is unbounded in the modular surface.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe several instances of the following phenomenon: In bad reduction situations the \( p \)-adic regulator has a continuous and a discrete component. The continuous component is computed using Vologodsky integrals. These depend on a choice of the branch of the \( p \)-adic logarithm, determined by \( \log (p) \). They can be differentiated with respect to this parameter and the result is related to the discrete component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb Q$ of rank $1$. In this paper, we develop an explicit numerical criterion, comparable to Gold's criterion, that determines whether the Iwasawa invariants of the elliptic curve at a good (ordinary or supersingular) prime attain their smallest possible value, i.e. whether $\mu_p^\pm(E) +\lambda^\pm_p(E)=1$ in the supersingular case or $\mu_p(E) + \lambda_p(E)=1$ in the ordinary case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study congruences for Eisenstein series on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ modulo $p^2$, where $p \geq 5$ is prime. It is classically known that all Eisenstein series of weight at least $4$ are determined modulo $p^2$ by those of weight at most $p^2-p+2$. We prove that up to powers of $E_{p-1}$, each such Eisenstein series is in fact determined modulo $p^2$ by a modular form of weight at most $2p-4$. We also determine $E_2$ modulo $p^2$ in terms of a modular form of weight $p+1$.</description>

      <title>On modular representations of C-recursive integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prunescu and Sauras-Altuzarra showed that all C-recursive sequences of natural numbers have an arithmetic div-mod representation that can be derived from their generating function. This representation consists of computing the quotient of two exponential polynomials and taking the remainder of the result modulo a third exponential polynomial, and works for all integers $n \geq 1$. Using a different approach, Prunescu proved the existence of two other representations, one of which is the mod-mod representation, consisting of two successive remainder computations. This result has two weaknesses: (i) the representation works only ultimately, and (ii) a correction term must be added to the first exponential polynomial. We show that a mod-mod representation without inner correction term holds for all integers $n \geq 1$. This follows directly from the div-mod representation by an arithmetic short-cut from outside.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the definition of spoof perfect numbers to multiperfect numbers and study their characteristics. As a result, we find several new odd spoof multiperfect numbers, akin to Descartes' number. An example is $8999757$, which would be an odd multiperfect number, if one of its prime factors, $61$, was a square. We briefly describe an algorithm for searching for such numbers and discuss a few of their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17218v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for certain Dedekind zeta functions, we show that the characteristic polynomial of a class of random tridiagonal matrices of large dimension is irreducible, with probability exponentially close to one; moreover, its Galois group over the rational numbers is either the symmetric or the alternating group. This is the counterpart of the results of Breuillard--Varj\'u (for polynomials with independent coefficients), and with those of Eberhard and Ferber--Jain--Sah--Sawhney (for full random matrices). We also analyse a related class of random tridiagonal matrices for which the Galois group is much smaller.</description>

Abstract: We develop an explicit version of the Kuznetsov trace formula for GSp(4), relating sums of Fourier coefficients to Kloosterman sums. We study the precise analytic behaviour of both the spectral and the arithmetic transforms arising in the Kuznetsov trace formula for GSp(4). We use these results to provide an effective version of the trace formula, and establish various results on the family of Maa{\ss} automorphic forms on GSp(4) in the spectral aspect: the Weyl law, a density result on the non-tempered spectrum, large sieve inequalities, bounds on the second moment of the spinor and standard $L$-functions, as well as a statement on the distribution of the low-lying zeros of these $L$-functions, determining the associated types of symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several mathematicians have investigated various partition functions with the goal of discovering Ramanujan-type congruences. One such function is $\overline{B}_{2^\alpha}(n)$, which represents the number of $2^\alpha-$regular overpartition pairs of $n$. In this context, we establish Ramanujan-type congruences modulo powers of $2$ for this function. For instance, we prove that \begin{equation*} \overline{B}_{2^{\alpha}}(2^{\alpha+\beta+1}(n+1)) \equiv 0\pmod{2^{3\beta+5}} \end{equation*} for all $n, \beta\geq 0,\, \alpha \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on $k$-gamma and $k$-digamma functions, we show four series expansions to the Furdui-type integral related to Riemann zeta function and hypergeometric function, and also present some new identities, series expansions and inequalities on the Hadamard $k$-gamma function and the Nielsen $k$-beta function. Finally, we also pose an open problem.</description>

      <title>K-theory and Lefschetz formula for locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semi-simple real Lie group of real rank one and $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup in $G$ such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. We introduce a new group $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$, which provides a natural framework for defining index classes of Dirac-type operators on the locally symmetirc space $\Gamma \backslash G /K$. We show that Dirac operators define elements in the $K$-theory of $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$ and use Hecke correspondences to study their Lefschetz numbers. Our main result is an explicit formula for the Lefschetz number of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>Accelerating true orbit pseudorandom number generation using Newton's method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary expansions of irrational algebraic numbers can serve as high-quality pseudorandom binary sequences. This study presents an efficient method for computing the exact binary expansions of real quadratic algebraic integers using Newton's method. To this end, we clarify conditions under which the first $N$ bits of the binary expansion of an irrational number match those of its upper rational approximation. Furthermore, we establish that the worst-case time complexity of generating a sequence of length $N$ with the proposed method is equivalent to the complexity of multiplying two $N$-bit integers, showing its efficiency compared to a previously proposed true orbit generator. We report the results of numerical experiments on computation time and memory usage, highlighting in particular that the proposed method successfully accelerates true orbit pseudorandom number generation. We also confirm that a generated pseudorandom sequence successfully passes all the statistical tests included in RabbitFile of TestU01.</description>

      <title>Regular singular Mahler equations and Newton polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though Mahler equations have been introduced nearly one century ago, the study of their solutions is still a fruitful topic for research. In particular, the Galois theory of Mahler equations has been the subject of many recent papers. Nevertheless, long is the way to a complete understanding of relations between solutions of Mahler equations. One step along this way is the study of singularities. Mahler equations with a regular singularity at 0 have rather "nice" solutions: they can be expressed with the help of Puiseux series and solutions of equations with constant coefficients. In [FP22] the authors described an algorithm to determine whether an equation is regular singular at 0 or not. Exploiting information from the Frobenius method and Newton polygons, we improve this algorithm by reducing significantly its complexity, by providing some simple criterion for an equation to be regular singular at 0 and by extending its scope to equations with Puiseux coefficients.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott (PTE) problem introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of the two-dimensional PTE problem from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). We moreover discover a certain design structure in the Borwein solution of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem. We also give a two-dimensional extension of the Borwein solution, and then discuss connections to the Alpers--Tijdeman solution for the two-dimensional PTE problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a provably quasi-polynomial algorithm to compute discrete logarithms in the multiplicative groups of finite fields of small characteristic, that is finite fields whose characteristic is logarithmic in the order. We partially follow the heuristically quasi-polynomial algorithm presented by Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux and Thome'. The main difference is to use a presentation of the finite field based on elliptic curves: the abundance of elliptic curves ensures the existence of such a presentation.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nahm sums are specific $q$-hypergeometric series associated with symmetric positive definite matrices. In this paper we study Nahm sums associated with symmetrizable matrices. We show that one direction of Nahm's conjecture, which was proven by Calegari, Garoufalidis, and Zagier for the symmetric case, also holds for the symmetrizable case. This asserts that the modularity of a Nahm sum implies that a certain element in a Bloch group associated with the Nahm sum is a torsion element. During the proof, we investigate the radial asymptotics of Nahm sums. Finally, we provide lists of candidates of modular Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices based on numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On primes in arithmetic progressions and bounded gaps between many primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the primes below $x$ are, on average, equidistributed in arithmetic progressions to smooth moduli of size up to $x^{1/2+1/40-\epsilon}$. The exponent of distribution $\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{40}$ improves on a result of Polymath, who had previously obtained the exponent $\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{7}{300}$. As a consequence, we improve results on intervals of bounded length which contain many primes, showing that $\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} (p_{n+m}-p_n) = O(\exp(3.8075 m))$. The main new ingredient of our proof is a modification of the q-van der Corput process. It allows us to exploit additional averaging for the exponential sums which appear in the Type I estimates of Polymath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lindel\"of conjectured that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ grows more slowly than any fixed positive power of $t$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$ when $\sigma\geq 1/2$. Hardy and Littlewood showed that this is equivalent to the existence of the $2k$th moments for all fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\sigma&gt;1/2$. In this paper we show that the completeness of the Hilbert space $B^2$ of Besicovitch almost-periodic functions implies that if the $2k$th moment exists for $\sigma&gt;\sigma_k&gt;1/2$ then it also exists on the line $\sigma=\sigma_k$.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform cyclotomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclotomy, the study of cyclotomic classes and cyclotomic numbers, is an area of number theory first studied by Gauss. It has natural applications in discrete mathematics and information theory. Despite this long history, there are significant limitations to what is known explicitly about cyclotomic numbers, which limits the use of cyclotomy in applications. The main explicit tool available is that of uniform cyclotomy, introduced by Baumert, Mills and Ward in 1982. In this paper, we present an extension of uniform cyclotomy which gives a direct method for evaluating all cyclotomic numbers over $GF(q^n)$ of order dividing $(q^n-1)/(q-1)$, for any prime power $q$ and $n \geq 2$, which does not use character theory nor direct calculation in the field. This allows the straightforward evaluation of many cyclotomic numbers for which other methods are unknown or impractical. Our methods exploit connections between cyclotomy, Singer difference sets and finite geometry.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety over $\mathbb Q$. We introduce a geometric non-degenerate criterion for $X$ using moduli spaces $M$ over $\mathbb Q$ of abelian varieties. If $X$ is non-degenerate, then we construct via $M$ an open dense moduli space $U\subseteq X$ whose forgetful map defines a Parsin construction for $U(\mathbb Q)$. For example if $M$ is a Hilbert modular variety then $U$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme and $X$ is non-degenerate iff a projective model $Y\subset \bar{M}$ of $X$ over $\mathbb Q$ contains no singular points of the minimal compactification $\bar{M}$. We motivate our constructions when $M$ is a rational variety over $\mathbb Q$ with $\dim(M)&gt;\dim(X)$. We study various geometric aspects of the non-degenerate criterion and we deduce arithmetic applications: If $X$ is non-degenerate, then $U(\mathbb Q)$ is finite by Faltings. Moreover, our constructions are made for the effective strategy which combines the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Parsin, Szpiro) with modularity and Masser-Wustholz isogeny estimates. When $M$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme, we use this strategy to explicitly bound the height and the number of $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$ if $X$ is non-degenerate. We illustrate our approach when $M$ is the Hilbert modular surface given by the classical icosahedron surface studied by Clebsch, Klein and Hirzebruch. For any curve $X$ over $\mathbb Q$, we construct and study explicit projective models $Y\subset\bar{M}$ called ico models. If $X$ is non-degenerate, then we give via $Y$ an effective Parsin construction and an explicit Weil height bound for $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$. As most ico models are non-degenerate and $X\setminus U$ is controlled, this establishes the effective Mordell conjecture for large classes of (explicit) curves over $\mathbb Q$. We also solve the ico analogue of the generalized Fermat problem by combining our height bounds with Diophantine approximations.</description>

Define the set of streams over R/Z such that the convolution product P(z)\times(x_n; n\in Z)=(\sum_{i=0}^k a_i x_{n-i}; n\in Z)=(0; n\in Z), which is called the stream 0 of P. We study similarities between stream 0 of P and the roots of P(z)=0.</description>

      <title>Construction of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper after proving (in Section 2) the Berkovich analytic space analog of the familiar fact that there exist many non-isomorphic Riemann surfaces of the fixed topological type, I introduce the precise notion of Arithmetic Holomorphic Structures. This leads, for a fixed geometrically connected, smooth quasi-projective variety $X/E$ over a $p$-adic field, to the construction of a category which can be called Arithmetic Teichmuller Space of $X/E$. After establishing the properties of this local i.e. $p$-adic Arithmetic Teichmuller Space, I proceed to the global (adelic) construction, for a geometrically connected, smooth quasi-projective variety $X/L$ over a number field $L$, of the Adelic Arithmetic Teichmuller Space of $X/L$. A fixed number field itself has an Arithmetic Teichmuller Space--this is detailed in Constructions II(1/2) paper in this series of papers. All of these constructions extend the analogy between Number fields and Riemann surfaces and are inspired by (and directly related to) Shinichi Mochizuki's ideas on Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory and his work on the abc-conjecture. But my approach is based on a completely different set of ideas.</description>

      <title>Canonical representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,n}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We study actions of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,n}$ via Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic techniques. We show that if $$\rho: \pi_1(\Sigma_{g,n})\to GL_r(\mathbb{C})$$ is a representation whose conjugacy class has finite orbit under the mapping class group, and $r&lt;\sqrt{g+1}$, then $\rho$ has finite image. This answers questions of Junho Peter Whang and Mark Kisin. We give applications of our methods to the Putman-Wieland conjecture, the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, and a question of Esnault-Kerz.
  The proofs rely on non-abelian Hodge theory, our earlier work on semistability of isomonodromic deformations, and recent work of Esnault-Groechenig and Klevdal-Patrikis on Simpson's integrality conjecture for cohomologically rigid local systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of Arithmetic Teichmuller spaces II: Proof of a local prototype of Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with consequences of the existence of Arithmetic Teichmuller spaces established in arXiv:2106.11452 and arXiv:2210.11635. Theorem~9.2.1 provides a proof of a local version of Mochizuki's Corollary~3.12. Local means for a fixed $p$-adic field. There are several new innovations in this paper. Some of the main results are as follows. Theorem~3.5.1 shows that one can view the Tate parameter of Tate elliptic curve as a function on the arithmetic Teichmuller space of [Joshi, 2021a], [Joshi, 2022b]. The next important point is the construction of Mochizuki's $\Theta_{gau}$-links and the set of such links, called Mochizuki's Ansatz in {\S}6. Theorem~6.9.1 establishes valuation scaling property satisfied by points of Mochizuki's Ansatz (i.e. by my version of $\Theta_{gau}$-links). These results lead to the construction of a theta-values set ({\S}8) which is similar to Mochizuki's Theta-values set (differences between the two are in {\S}8.7.1). Finally Theorem~9.2.1 is established. For completeness, I provide an intrinsic proof of the existence of Mochizuki's $\log$-links (Theorem 10.9.1), $\mathfrak{log}$-links (Theorem~10.15.1) and Mochizuki's log-Kummer Indeterminacy (Theorem~10.20.1) in my theory.</description>

      <title>An $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree and $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey chain of Andrews, Schilling and the author is extended to a four-parameter $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree. As main application of this tree, we prove the Kanade-Russell conjecture for a three-parameter family of Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities related to the principal characters of the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$. Combined with known $q$-series results, this further implies an $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$-analogue of the celebrated Andrews-Gordon $q$-series identities. We also use the $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree to prove a Rogers-Selberg-type identity for the characters of the principal subspaces of $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ indexed by arbitrary level-$k$ dominant integral weights $\lambda$. This generalises a result of Feigin, Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin for $\lambda=k\Lambda_0$.</description>

      <title>The supersingular endomorphism ring problem given one endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a supersingular elliptic curve E and a non-scalar endomorphism $\alpha$ of E, we prove that the endomorphism ring of E can be computed in classical time about disc(Z[$\alpha$])^1/4 , and in quantum subexponential time, assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis. Previous results either had higher complexities, or relied on heuristic assumptions. Along the way, we prove that the Primitivisation problem can be solved in polynomial time (a problem previously believed to be hard), and we prove that the action of smooth ideals on oriented elliptic curves can be computed in polynomial time (previous results of this form required the ideal to be powersmooth, i.e., not divisible by any large prime power). Following the attacks on SIDH, isogenies in high dimension are a central ingredient of our results.</description>

Abstract: We design an algorithm for computing the $L$-series associated to an Anderson $t$-motives, exhibiting quasilinear complexity with respect to the target precision. Based on experiments, we conjecture that the order of vanishing at $T=1$ of the $v$-adic $L$-series of a given Anderson $t$-motive with good reduction does not depend on the finite place $v$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It can be described in terms of the geodesic flow and an automorphic function on a homogeneous space. This process has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing and essential spectral gaps for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense $\Theta$-Anosov subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group for some nonempty subset of simple roots $\Theta$. In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space $\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows $\{a^{\mathsf{v}}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\mathsf{v}$ in the interior of the $\Theta$-limit cone $\mathcal{L}_\Theta$ of $\Gamma$, which are conjugate to reparametrizations of the Gromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional cone $\mathscr{E} \subset \operatorname{int}\mathcal{L}_\Theta$, which is a smooth image of the linear spans of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to $\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a compact set of such vectors. We also obtain an essential spectral gap for the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with a power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to prove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation flows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The exceptional cone $\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those vectors.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $\deg (P)&gt;\deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$ which is not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbf{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. In particular, the dynamics of BNQN (an iterative method) seems to have some striking similarities to Newton's method (a continuous method) and the classical Poincar\'e-Bendixon theorem for differentiable real dynamical systems on the complex plane. This is the more interesting given that discrete versions of Newton's method (e.g. Relaxed Newton's method) does not behave this way.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithms to Solve the $(n,k)$-Complete Hidden Subset Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) is a significant NP-complete problem in number theory and combinatorics, with applications in cryptography and AI privacy. For the $(n,k)$-complete HSSP, where a target multiset must be recovered from its all $k$-subset sums, existing algorithms face limitations due to high complexity or intractability. This paper proposes two deterministic algorithms: a brute-force approach, and a novel method leveraging symmetric polynomials and Vieta's formulas with $O\left(\sum_{u=1}^n p(u,\leq k)^3+\binom{n}{k}n\right)$ complexity, where $ p(u,\leq k)$ counts the number of partitions of a positive integer $u$ into at most $k$ parts. The latter constructs an $n$-th degree polynomial via Vieta's formulas, whose roots correspond to the hidden multiset elements. Additionally, the discussion about the homogeneous symmetric polynomial rings is of independent interest.</description>
