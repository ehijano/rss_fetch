      <title>Linear Bounds for the Lengths of Geodesics on Manifolds With Curvature Bounded Below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a simply connected Riemannian manifold in $\mathscr{M}_{k,v}^D(n)$, the space of closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ with sectional curvature bounded below by $k$, volume bounded below by $v$, and diameter bounded above by $D$. Let $c$ be the smallest positive real number such that any closed curve of length at most $2d$ can be contracted to a point over curves of length at most $cd$, where $d$ is the diameter of $M$. In this paper, we show that under these hypotheses there exists a computable rational function, $G(n,k,v,D)$, such that any continuous map of $S^l$ to $\Omega_{p,q}M$, the space of piecewise differentiable curves on $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$, is homotopic to a map whose image consists of curves of length at most $\exp(c\exp(G(n,k,v,D))$. In particular, for any points $p,q \in M$ and any integer $m&gt;0$ there exist at least $m$ geodesics connecting $p$ and $q$ of length at most $m\exp(c\exp(G(n,k,v,D))$.</description>

      <title>Entropy Stability for products of negatively curved symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g_0)$ be a closed oriented $n$-manifold that is locally isometric to a product $(X^{n_1}_1,g_1)\times\cdots (X_k^{n_k},g_k)$, where each $n_i\ge 3,$ and each factor $(X_i^{n_i},g_i)$ is a negatively curved symmetric space. We study the stability of minimal entropy rigidity for such manifolds. Specifically, we consider whether an entropy-minimizing sequence $(M,g_i)$ converges to the model space in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense after removing negligible subsets. Previously, Song [Son23] established this type of stability for negatively curved symmetric spaces, where both the $n$-volume of the removed subsets and the $(n-1)$-volume of their boundaries converge to zero. We construct a counterexample demonstrating that this stronger stability notion does not generally hold in the product case; in particular, the condition that the $(n-1)$-volume of the boundary of removed subsets converges to zero cannot be imposed. Nonetheless, we prove that an entropy-minimizing sequence $(M,g_i)$ converges to the model space after removing subsets whose $n$-volume converges to zero in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. This result provides a weaker form of stability compared to the negatively symmetric case. A key ingredient in establishing this stability is our proof of the intrinsic uniqueness of the spherical Plateau solution for products of negatively curved symmetric spaces, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Deformation quantization and Geometric quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the quantization of K\"ahler manifolds, focusing on the relationship between deformation quantization and geometric quantization. We provide a classification of degree 1 formal quantizable functions in the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization, establishing that these formal functions are of the form $f = f_0 - \frac{\hbar}{4\pi}(\Delta f_0 + c)$ for a certain smooth (non-formal) function $f_0$. If $f_0$ is real-valued then $f_0$ corresponds to a Hamiltonian Killing vector field. In the presence of Hamiltonian $G$-symmetry, we address the compatibility between the infinitesimal symmetry for deformation quantization via quantum moment map and infinitesimal symmetry on geometric quantization acting on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections via Berezin-Toeplitz quantization.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lorentz surfaces and s-embeddings I: isothermic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S-embeddings were introduced by Chelkak as a tool to study the conformal invariance of the thermodynamic limit of the Ising model. Moreover, Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh introduced a lift of s-embeddings to Lorentz space, and showed that in the limit the lift converges to a maximal surface. They posed the question whether there are s-embeddings that lift to maximal surfaces already at the discrete level, before taking the limit. This paper is the first in a two paper series, in which we answer that question in the positive. In this paper we introduce a correspondence between s-embeddings (incircular nets) and congruences of touching Lorentz spheres. This geometric interpretation of s-embeddings enables us to apply the tools of discrete differential geometry. We identify a subclass of s-embeddings -- isothermic s-embeddings -- that lift to (discrete) S-isothermic surfaces, which were introduced by Bobenko and Pinkall. S-isothermic surfaces are the key component that will allow us to obtain discrete maximal surfaces in the follow-up paper. Moreover, we show here that the Ising weights of an isothermic s-embedding are in a subvariety.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau metrics through Grassmannian learning and Donaldson's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the problem of numerical K\"ahler metrics, we survey machine learning techniques in this area, discussing both advantages and drawbacks. We then revisit the algebraic ansatz pioneered by Donaldson. Inspired by his work, we present a novel approach to obtaining Ricci-flat approximations to K\"ahler metrics, applying machine learning within a `principled' framework. In particular, we use gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold to identify an efficient subspace of sections for calculation of the metric. We combine this approach with both Donaldson's algorithm and learning on the $h$-matrix itself (the latter method being equivalent to gradient descent on the fibre bundle of Hermitian metrics on the tautological bundle over the Grassmannian). We implement our methods on the Dwork family of threefolds, commenting on the behaviour at different points in moduli space. In particular, we observe the emergence of nontrivial local minima as the moduli parameter is increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two negatively curved metric spaces are iso-length-spectral if they have the same multisets of lengths of closed geodesics. A well-known paper by Sunada provides a systematic way of constructing iso-length-spectral surfaces that are not isometric. In this paper, we construct examples of iso-length-spectral surface amalgams that are not isometric, generalizing Buser's combinatorial construction of Sunada's surfaces. We find both homeormophic and non-homeomorphic pairs. Finally, we construct a noncommensurable pair with the same weak length spectrum, the length set without multiplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integrability to second order of infinitesimal Einstein deformations on compact Riemannian and in particular on K\"ahler manifolds. We find a new way of expressing the necessary and sufficient condition for integrability to second order, which also gives a very clear and compact way of writing the Koiso obstruction. As an application we consider the K\"ahler case, where the condition can be further simplified and in complex dimension $3$ turns out to be purely algebraic. One of our main results is the complete and explicit description of infinitesimal Einstein deformation integrable to second order on the complex $2$-plane Grassmannian, which also has a quaternion K\"ahler structure. As a striking consequence we find that the symmetric Einstein metric on the Grassmannian $ \mathrm{Gr}_2(\bbC^{n+2})$ for $n$ odd is rigid.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics on homogeneous spaces $H\times H/\Delta K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any compact homogeneous space $H/K$ with $H$ simple, we consider the new space $M=H\times H/\Delta K$, where $\Delta K$ denotes diagonal embedding, and study the existence, classification and stability of $H\times H$-invariant Einstein metrics on $M$, as a first step into the largely unexplored case of homogeneous spaces of compact non-simple Lie groups. We find unstable Einstein metrics on $M$ for most spaces $H/K$ such that their standard metric is Einstein (e.g., isotropy irreducible) and the Killing form of $\mathfrak{k}$ is a multiple of the Killing form of $\mathfrak{h}$ (e.g., $K$ simple), a class which contains $17$ families and $50$ individual examples. A complete classification is obtained in the case when $H/K$ is an irreducible symmetric space with $K$ simple. We also study the behavior of the scalar curvature function on the space of all normal metrics on $M=H\times H/\Delta K$ (none of which is Einstein), obtaining that the standard metric is a global minimum.</description>

Abstract: For any integers $m\geqslant n\geqslant 3$, we construct a Ricci limit space $X_{m,n}$ such that for a fixed point, some tangent cones are $\mathbb{R}^m$ and some are $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is an improvement of Menguy's example. Moreover, we show that for any finite collection of closed Riemannian manifolds $(M_i^{n_i},g_i)$ with $\mathrm{Ric}_{g_i}\geqslant(n_i-1)\geqslant 1$, there exists a collapsed Ricci limit space $(X,d,x)$ such that each Riemannian cone $C(M_i,g_i)$ is a tangent cone of $X$ at $x$.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of spheres with subsets removed and $L^\infty$ metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the scalar curvature rigidity for $L^\infty$ metrics on $\mathbb S^n\backslash\Sigma$, where $\mathbb S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional sphere with $n\geq 3$ and $\Sigma$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb S^n$ of codimension at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$ that satisfies the wrapping property. The notion of wrapping property was introduced by the second author for studying related scalar curvature rigidity problems on spheres. For example, any closed subset of $\mathbb S^n$ contained in a hemisphere and any finite subset of $\mathbb S^n$ satisfy the wrapping property. The same techniques also apply to prove an analogous scalar rigidity result for $L^\infty$ metrics on tori that are smooth away from certain subsets of codimension at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$. As a corollary, we obtain a positive mass theorem for complete asymptotically flat spin manifolds with arbitrary ends for $L^\infty$ metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `hypoelliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi contact metric manifolds (introduced by Y. Tashiro and then studied by several authors) are a natural extension of the contact metric manifolds. Weak almost contact metric manifolds, i.e., the linear complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, were defined by the author and R. Wolak. In this paper, we study a weak analogue of quasi contact metric manifolds. Our main results generalize some well known theorems and provide new criterions for K-contact and Sasakian manifolds in terms of conditions on the curvature tensor and other geometric objects associated with the weak quasi-contact metric structure.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the trilinear functional of differential one-forms, spectral triple and spectral torsion for the Hodge-Dirac operator, we introduce a multilinear functional of differential one-forms for a finitely summable regular spectral triple with a noncommutative residue, which generalize the spectral torsion defined by Dabrowski-Sitarz-Zalecki. The main results of this paper recover two forms, torsion of the linear connection and four forms by the noncommutative residue and perturbed de-Rham Hodge operators, and provides an explicit computation of generalized spectral torsion associated with the perturbed de-Rham Hodge Dirac triple.</description>

Abstract: Given a weighted toroidal graph, each realization to a Euclidean torus is associated with the Dirichlet energy. By minimizing the energy over all possible Euclidean structures and over all realizations within a fixed homotopy class, one obtains a harmonic map into an optimal Euclidean torus. We show that only with this optimal Euclidean structure, the harmonic map and the edge weights are induced from a weighted Delaunay decomposition.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Foliation-generating observers under Lorentz transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples, and discuss the implications of these results for the $3+1$ formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>
