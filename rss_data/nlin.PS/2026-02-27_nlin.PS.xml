      <title>Kelvin wave and soliton propagation in classical viscous vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex filaments are highly rotating localized structures of fluids that admits several types of excitation. Here, we study them by using numerical simulations of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We first address the propagation of Kelvin waves, helicoidal excitations propagating along the filament, and measure their dispersion relation which turns out to be in good agreement with the original Lord Kelvin predictions. Then, inspired by the connection between vortex line dynamics and an integrable system, we show numerically the existence of solitons propagating along vortex filaments and study the collision of two of such structures. Finally, we show numerically the experimental feasibility of studying vortex solitons in the lab, by proposing an experiment for their generation.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for dynamic patterns in coupled oscillator networks: When larger networks are simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical systems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Their behaviour is often characterized by the emergence of various partially synchronized dynamic patterns, which in the case of large networks can be analysed using a variant of the mean-field approach. This method allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be observed for different system parameters. But it is less known that for different partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical equilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged observable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of these oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we show how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for finite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of the corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for large networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial observations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera states in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling. The extension of the method to other systems with all-to-all and random network topologies is also described.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that the velocity is not in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the velocity is not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>
