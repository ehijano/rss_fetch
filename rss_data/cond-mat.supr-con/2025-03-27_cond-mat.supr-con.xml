      <title>Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and Predictions of New Kagome Flat Band Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the flat-band kagome superconductor LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, which has recently been reported to host charge density wave (CDW) order above room temperature ($T_{CDW} \simeq 400$ K). The stable crystal structure above the CDW transition is identified via soft phonon condensation and confirmed to be harmonically stable through ab initio calculations, consistent with recent X-ray diffraction refinements. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be mode-selective, primarily driven by strong interactions between Ru-$B_{3u}$ phonons (local $x$-direction, pointing toward the hexagon center) and Ru-$A_g$ electrons (local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital) within the kagome lattice. Using a spring-ball model, we identify this mode-selective EPC as a universal feature of kagome materials. Employing the newly developed Gaussian approximation of the hopping parameters, we derive an analytical expression for the EPC and demonstrate that superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is mostly driven by the coupling between the kagome $B_{3u}$ phonons and the $A_g$ electrons. The impact of doping is also investigated, revealing that light hole doping (approximately one hole per unit cell) significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ by 50%, whereas heavy doping induces structural instability and ferromagnetism. Furthermore, high-throughput screening identifies 3063 stable 1:3:2 kagome materials, of which 428 are predicted to exhibit superconductivity with $T_c &gt; 1$ K, and the highest $T_c$ reaching 15 K. These findings establish LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and related materials as promising platforms for exploring the interplay among kagome flat bands, EPC, and superconductivity. Additionally, they may offer valuable insights into potential limitations on the $T_c$ of flat-band superconductivity in real materials.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states and supercurrent in an unconventional superconductor-altermagnetic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with $\pm 45^\circ$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a $\pi$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in the local density of states on the UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap feature with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. Assisted by numerical simulations, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on the UTe2 (011) surface arise from the interplay between the gapless surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing and the vortex bound states because of the cylindrical squarish Fermi surface of UTe2. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex is strong evidence of the gapless surface states on UTe2 (011) surface, which rules out the possibility of B2u pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$ for any normal layer thickness $L$ taking into account phase gradients in superconducting layers. The current-phase relation was derived in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically and is exact in the limit of large ratio of the Fermi energy to the superconducting gap. Obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in the widely accepted theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\to 0$ (short junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model.</description>

      <title>Topological Peierls instabilities in more than one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A periodic lattice distortion that reduces the translational symmetry folds electron bands into a reduced Brillouin zone, leading to band mixing and a tendency to gap formation, as in the Peierls transition in one-dimensional systems. However, in higher dimensions, the resulting phase can present topological obstructions preventing a complete gap opening. We discuss two different mechanisms for such obstructions, emergent Weyl nodes and symmetry protected band crossings. Based on density-functional calculations, we show these mechanisms are at play in trigonal PtBi$_2$.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the CuO monolayer in the paramagnetic phase considering the Coulomb interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the CuO monolayer is investigated taking into account the intra- and interatomic Coulomb interactions on copper and oxygen atoms. Local Coulomb interactions and covalence effects are treated exactly when constructing quasiparticle excitations using the generalized tight-binding method (GTB). The electronic system is described in the hole representation within the eight-band p-d model including long-range hoppings up to four nearest neighbors with parameters obtained from calculations using the density functional theory. Using the multiband Hubbard model, we calculated the dependencies of the band structure of quasiparticle excitations, Fermi surfaces, constant energy maps at the top of the valence band, band gap values and contributions of different orbitals to states at the top of the valence band in the regime of strong intra-atomic Coulomb interactions on copper for different values of the intra-atomic interaction on oxygen $U_p$ and the interatomic copper-oxygen interaction $V_{pd}$. It is shown that the system goes from the insulating state with d-states at the top of the valence band to the metallic state in which the main contribution to low-energy excitations is made by oxygen orbitals depending on the values of the parameters $U_p$ and $V_{pd}$.</description>

      <title>Pressure effects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>
