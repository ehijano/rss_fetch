      <title>VR-PIC: An entropic variance-reduction method for particle-in-cell solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed entropic and conservative variance reduction framework [M. Sadr, N. G. Hadjiconstantinou, A variance-reduced direct Monte Carlo simulation method for solving the Boltzmann equation over a wide range of rarefaction, Journal of Computational Physics 472 (2023) 111677.] to the particle-in-cell (PIC) method of solving Vlasov-Poisson equation. We show that a zeroth-order approximation that freezes the importance weights during the velocity-space kick is stable at the expense of introducing bias. Then, we propose a correction for the weight distribution using maximum cross-entropy formulation to ensure conservation laws while minimizing the introduced bias. In several test cases including Sod's shock tube and Landau damping we show that the proposed method maintains the substantial speed-up of variance reduction method compared to the PIC simulations in the low signal regime with minimal changes to the simulation code.</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell methods with stochastic collision models are commonly used to simulate collisional plasma dynamics, with applications ranging from hypersonic flight to semiconductor manufacturing. Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fission Matrix Databases using Temperature Profiles obtained from High-Fidelity Multiphysics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fission Matrix method is used to perform fast and still accurate neutronics simulations. It relies on precalculated databases obtained through a Monte Carlo simulation. To represent every state of the reactor, multiple databases are required. The actual state of the reactor is obtained from those databases. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the temperature profiles selected to construct the databases. To do so, the Molten Salt Fast reactor is selected. Two sets of databases are studied: the first uses temperature profiles obtained from high-fidelity Multiphysics simulations with Cardinal, and the second uses uniform temperature profiles. Results showed improved multiplication factor and fission source distribution when the temperature profiles used to generate the databases were similar to those expected when solving the fission matrix.</description>

      <title>Neural-POD: A Plug-and-Play Neural Operator Framework for Infinite-Dimensional Functional Nonlinear Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of AI for Science is often hindered by the "discretization", where learned representations remain restricted to the specific grids or resolutions used during training. We propose the Neural Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Neural-POD), a plug-and-play neural operator framework that constructs nonlinear, orthogonal basis functions in infinite-dimensional space using neural networks. Unlike the classical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is limited to linear subspace approximations obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD), Neural-POD formulates basis construction as a sequence of residual minimization problems solved through neural network training. Each basis function is obtained by learning to represent the remaining structure in the data, following a process analogous to Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization. This neural formulation introduces several key advantages over classical POD: it enables optimization in arbitrary norms (e.g., $L^2$, $L^1$), learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces that is resolution-invariant, generalizes effectively to unseen parameter regimes, and inherently captures nonlinear structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. The resulting basis functions are interpretable, reusable, and enabling integration into both reduced order modeling (ROM) and operator learning frameworks such as deep operator learning (DeepONet). We demonstrate the robustness of Neural-POD with different complex spatiotemporal systems, including the Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations. We further show that Neural-POD serves as a high performance, plug-and-play bridge between classical Galerkin projection and operator learning that enables consistent integration with both projection-based reduced order models and DeepONet frameworks.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening and mechanistic insights into solid acid proton conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~{\AA} at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.</description>

      <title>Machine learning electronic structure and atomistic properties from the external potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations remain a major bottleneck in atomistic simulations and, not surprisingly, have attracted significant attention in machine learning (ML). Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis.
  Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived.</description>

      <title>A Robust Truncated-Domain Approach for Cone--Jet Simulations in Electrospinning and Electrospraying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows.</description>

      <title>Virtual ultrasound machine operating in a GHz to MHz frequency range for particle-based biomedical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound-matter interactions underpin numerous biomedical and soft-matter applications, yet simulating these phenomena is challenging due to the large separation of viscous and sonic time scales. Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. Beyond this application, the approach establishes a generalizable platform for simulating wave-matter interactions in soft and biological materials, opening new directions for computational studies of acoustics-driven phenomena in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Novel distance-based masking and adaptive alpha-shape methods for CNN-ready reconstruction of arbitrary 2D CFD flow domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpolating scattered CFD datasets onto a uniform Cartesian grid can distort the true geometry, producing a convex-hull type envelope and activating nonphysical regions. This work presents a reconstruction framework that recovers physically consistent masks before exporting CNN-ready fields. It introduces two novel strategies, distance-based masking and an adaptive alpha-shape formulation that normalizes alpha using local data resolution, and evaluates them against classical alpha-shape boundary recovery. A quantitative, topology-aware metric suite is introduced to assess retention, suppression of unsupported regions, overlap consistency, and connectivity. The novel distance-based method is robust across the geometries considered under the same threshold rule, with tau set to the minimum CFD grid spacing, and achieves 500-800 times speedups over classical alpha-shapes. The adaptive alpha-shape remains stable when its control parameter is set to 1 and is 1.7-2.6 times faster than the classical variant, which requires geometry-specific alpha tuning. A lightweight boundary inflation post-process using a minimal dilation further improves retention by up to 2.96% with negligible unsupported activation (less than 0.08%). Overall, the distance-based method is recommended as the default due to its accuracy, stability, minimal tuning, and low cost, while the adaptive alpha-shape is a strong alternative when grid-spacing information for threshold selection is unavailable. A companion web application operationalizes the workflow end to end, enabling 2D ASCII dataset upload, parameter tuning, mask and boundary generation, and export of CNN-ready outputs.</description>

      <title>Uni-Flow: a unified autoregressive-diffusion model for complex multiscale flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal flows govern diverse phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, yet modelling their multiscale dynamics remains a central challenge. Despite major advances in physics-informed machine learning, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously maintain long-term temporal evolution and resolve fine-scale structure across chaotic, turbulent, and physiological regimes. Here, we introduce Uni-Flow, a unified autoregressive-diffusion framework that explicitly separates temporal evolution from spatial refinement for modelling complex dynamical systems. The autoregressive component learns low-resolution latent dynamics that preserve large-scale structure and ensure stable long-horizon rollouts, while the diffusion component reconstructs high-resolution physical fields, recovering fine-scale features in a small number of denoising steps. We validate Uni-Flow across canonical benchmarks, including two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, three-dimensional turbulent channel inflow generation with a quantum-informed autoregressive prior, and patient-specific simulations of aortic coarctation derived from high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic solvers. In the cardiovascular setting, Uni-Flow enables task-level faster than real-time inference of pulsatile hemodynamics, reconstructing high-resolution pressure fields over physiologically relevant time horizons in seconds rather than hours. By transforming high-fidelity hemodynamic simulation from an offline, HPC-bound process into a deployable surrogate, Uni-Flow establishes a pathway to faster-than-real-time modelling of complex multiscale flows, with broad implications for scientific machine learning in flow physics.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed data-driven inference of an interpretable equivariant LES model of incompressible fluid turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restrictive phenomenological assumptions represent a major roadblock for the development of accurate subgrid-scale models of fluid turbulence. Specifically, these assumptions limit a model's ability to describe key quantities of interest, such as local fluxes of energy and enstrophy, in the presence of diverse coherent structures. This paper introduces a symbolic data-driven subgrid-scale model that requires no phenomenological assumptions and has no adjustable parameters, yet it outperforms leading LES models. A combination of a priori and a posteriori benchmarks shows that the model produces accurate predictions of various quantities including local fluxes across a broad range of two-dimensional turbulent flows. While the model is inferred using LES-style spatial coarse-graining, its structure is more similar to RANS models, as it employs an additional field to describe subgrid scales. We find that this field must have a rank-two tensor structure in order to correctly represent both the components of the subgrid-scale stress tensor and the various fluxes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Finite-Element Analysis of Multiscale Electromagnetic Problems via Sparse Operator-Adapted Wavelet Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a finite element method (FEM) framework enhanced by an operator-adapted wavelet decomposition algorithm designed for the efficient analysis of multiscale electromagnetic problems. Usual adaptive FEM approaches, while capable of achieving the desired accuracy without requiring a complete re-meshing of the computational domain, inherently couple different resolution levels. This coupling requires recomputation of coarser-level solutions whenever finer details are added to improve accuracy, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Our proposed method addresses this issue by decoupling resolution levels. This feature enables independent computations at each scale that can be incorporated into the solutions to improve accuracy whenever needed, without requiring re-computation of coarser-level solutions. The main algorithm is hierarchical, constructing solutions from finest to coarser levels through a series of sparse matrix-vector multiplications. Due to its sparse nature, the overall computational complexity of the algorithm is nearly linear. Moreover, Krylov subspace iterative solvers are employed to solve the final linear equations, with ILU preconditioners that enhance solver convergence and maintain overall computational efficiency. The numerical experiments presented in this article verify the high precision and nearly linear computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream physics hybrid networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely ''Kovasznay flow'' problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

Abstract: To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library, and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way toward an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in classical filtered Navier-Stokes closures. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation between resolved and unresolved scales nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor structure. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows how its hydrodynamic limit can converge to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in magnetic materials using the local spin density approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>

Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Radiation Diffusion on a Moving Mesh: Implementation in RICH and Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</description>

      <title>Recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems.</description>
