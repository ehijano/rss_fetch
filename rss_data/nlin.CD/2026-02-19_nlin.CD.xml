      <title>Stochastic Lorenz dynamics and wind reversals in Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorenz equations [1] are a severe Galerkin-truncation of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) equations describing Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Here we examine the mathematical connections between the chaotic lobe-switching behavior of a stochastic form of the Lorenz equations, that model the interaction between the thermal boundary layers and the core circulation, and the mean wind reversals in the experiments of Sreenivasan et al. [2]. Long-time numerical simulations of these stochastic equations, not easily accessible with the OB equations, yield a probability distribution for lobe inter-switch timings that exhibits non-Gaussian, multifractal behavior. In the Gaussian frequency range the simulations mirror the laboratory measurements and the classical Hurst exponent and quadratic variation show Brownian second-moment statistics. Further scrutiny reveals a non-linear cumulant generating function, or moment-exponent function, and thus multifractality. A simple generalized two-scale Cantor-cascade analysis reproduces these properties, showing that multiplicative intermittency, characteristic of turbulence, strongly influences the statistics. This demonstrates that this stochastic Lorenz system is a faithful, low-dimensional surrogate for mean-wind reversals in RBC.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for dynamic patterns in coupled oscillator networks: When larger networks are simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical systems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Their behaviour is often characterized by the emergence of various partially synchronized dynamic pattern, which in the case of large networks can be analysed using a variant of the mean-field approach. This method allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be observed for different system parameters. But it is less known that for different partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical equilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged observable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of these oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we show how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for finite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of the corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for large networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial observations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera states in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling. The extension of the method to other systems with all-to-all and random network topologies is also described.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Ni\~no data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</description>
