      <title>Exploration of Hepatitis B Virus Infection Dynamics through Virology-Informed Neural Network: A Novel Artificial Intelligence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Virology-Informed Neural Networks (VINNs), a powerful tool for capturing the intricate dynamics of viral infection when data of some compartments of the model are not available. VINNs, an extension of the widely known Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), offer an alternative approach to traditional numerical methods for solving system of differential equations. We apply this VINN technique on a recently proposed hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection dynamics model to predict the transmission of the infection within the liver more accurately. This model consists of four compartments, namely uninfected and infected hepatocytes, rcDNA-containing capsids, and free viruses, along with the consideration of capsid recycling. Leveraging the power of VINNs, we study the impacts of variations in parameter range, experimental noise, data variability, network architecture, and learning rate in this work. In order to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of VINNs, we employ this approach on the data collected from nine HBV-infceted chimpanzees, and it is observed that VINNs can effectively estimate the model parameters. VINNs reliably capture the dynamics of infection spread and accurately predict their future progression using real-world data. Furthermore, VINNs efficiently identify the most influential parameters in HBV dynamics based solely on experimental data from the capsid component. It is also expected that this framework can be extended beyond viral dynamics, providing a powerful tool for uncovering hidden patterns and complex interactions across various scientific and engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Integrating Dynamical Systems Modeling with Spatiotemporal scRNA-seq Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of biological systems is fundamental to deciphering cellular behavior, developmental processes, and disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of an Extreme-Scale, High-Performance, and Modular Agent-Based Simulation Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling is indispensable for studying complex systems across many domains. However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources.
  This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works.
  First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code.
  Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server.
  Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.
  BioDynaMo has been widely adopted, including a prize-winning radiotherapy simulation recognized as a top 10 breakthrough in physics in 2024.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the ESM2 protein language model to understand the functional impact of missense variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional effect of missense variants is of crucial importance, yet challenging. To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.</description>

      <title>Proteome-wide prediction of mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism underlying genetic diseases using structural interactomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Studying self-organisation across the biosphere with process-enablement graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of many contemporary theories of life is the concept of biological self-organisation: organisms have to continuously produce and maintain the conditions of their own existence in order to stay alive. The way in which these accounts articulate this concept, however, differs quite significantly. As a result, it can be difficult to identify self-organising features within biological systems, and to compare different descriptions of such features. In this paper, we develop a graph theoretic formalism -- process-enablement graphs -- to study the organisational structure of living systems. Cycles within these graphs capture self-organising components of a system in a general and abstract way. We build the mathematical tools needed to compare biological models as process-enablement graphs, facilitating a comparison of their corresponding descriptions of self-organisation in a consistent and precise manner. We apply our formalism to a range of classical theories of life and demonstrate exactly how these models are similar, and where they differ, with respect to their organisational structure. While our current framework does not demarcate living systems from non-living ones, it does allow us to better study systems that lie in the grey area between life and non-life.</description>

      <title>Purported quantitative support for multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans is an artefact of an imbalanced hypothesis testing framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prominent report claimed substantial support for two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans using a calculation that combined phylodynamic inferences and epidemic models. Inspection of the calculation identifies an imbalance in the hypothesis testing framework that confounds this result; the single-introduction model was tested against more stringent conditions than the two-introduction model. Here, I show that when the two-introduction model is tested against the same conditions, the support disappears.</description>

      <title>Affinity-VAE: incorporating prior knowledge in representation learning from scientific images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning compact and interpretable representations of data is a critical challenge in scientific image analysis. Here, we introduce Affinity-VAE, a generative model that enables us to impose our scientific intuition about the similarity of instances in the dataset on the learned representation during training. We demonstrate the utility of the approach in the scientific domain of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) where a significant current challenge is to identify similar molecules within a noisy and low contrast tomographic image volume. This task is distinct from classification in that, at inference time, it is unknown whether an instance is part of the training set or not. We trained affinity-VAE using prior knowledge of protein structure to inform the latent space. Our model is able to create rotationally-invariant, morphologically homogeneous clusters in the latent representation, with improved cluster separation compared to other approaches. It achieves competitive performance on protein classification with the added benefit of disentangling object pose, structural similarity and an interpretable latent representation. In the context of cryo-ET data, affinity-VAE captures the orientation of identified proteins in 3D which can be used as a prior for subsequent scientific experiments. Extracting physical principles from a trained network is of significant importance in scientific imaging where a ground truth training set is not always feasible.</description>

      <title>PharmacoMatch: Efficient 3D Pharmacophore Screening via Neural Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of screening libraries poses a significant challenge for the development of virtual screening methods for drug discovery, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional approaches in the era of big data. Although 3D pharmacophore screening remains a prevalent technique, its application to very large datasets is limited by the computational cost associated with matching query pharmacophores to database molecules. In this study, we introduce PharmacoMatch, a novel contrastive learning approach based on neural subgraph matching. Our method reinterprets pharmacophore screening as an approximate subgraph matching problem and enables efficient querying of conformational databases by encoding query-target relationships in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive investigations of the learned representations and evaluate PharmacoMatch as pre-screening tool in a zero-shot setting. We demonstrate significantly shorter runtimes and comparable performance metrics to existing solutions, providing a promising speed-up for screening very large datasets.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales-ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE more effectively captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations alike. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks, including MD17 and alanine dipeptide, demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</description>

      <title>FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</description>
