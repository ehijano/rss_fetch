      <title>Individual and Collective Welfare in Risk Sharing with Many States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study efficient risk sharing among risk-averse agents in an economy with a large, finite number of states. Following a random shock to an initial agreement, agents may renegotiate. If they require a minimal utility improvement to accept a new deal, we show the probability of finding a mutually acceptable allocation vanishes exponentially as the state space grows. This holds regardless of agents' degree of risk aversion. In a two-agent multiple-priors model, we find that the potential for Pareto-improving trade requires that at least one agent's set of priors has a vanishingly small measure. Our results hinge on the ``shape does not matter'' message of high-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities.</description>

      <title>Decision theory and the "almost implies near" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores relaxing behavioral axioms in decision theory. We demonstrate that when a preference approximately satisfies a key axiom (like independence or stationarity) its utility representation is close to a standard model. The degree of the axiom's violation quantitatively determines this proximity. Interestingly, we show that in some cases, a relaxed axiom, when combined with another property like homotheticity, still implies an exact representation. We establish these ``almost implies near'' results for choice under risk, uncertainty, and intertemporal choice, connecting axiomatic deviations to the notion of approximate optimization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalars: Zonotope-Valued Utility for Representation of Multidimensional Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new framework for representing multidimensional incomplete preferences through zonotope-valued utilities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional scalar and vector-based models in decision theory. Traditional approaches assign single numerical values to alternatives, failing to capture the complexity of preferences where alternatives remainmain incomparable due to conflicting criteria across multiple dimensions. Our method maps each alternative to a zonotope, a convex geometric object in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) formed by Minkowski sums of intervals, which encapsulates the multidimensional structure of preferences with mathematical rigor. The set-valued nature of these payoffs stems from multiple sources, including non-probabilistic uncertainty, such as imprecise utility evaluation due to incomplete information about criteria weights, and probabilistic uncertainty arising from stochastic decision environments. By decomposing preference relations into interval orders and utilizing an extended set difference operator, we establish a rigorous axiomatization that defines preference as one alternative's zonotope differing from another's within the non-negative orthant of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This framework generalizes existing representations and provides a visually intuitive and theoretically robust tool for modeling trade-offs among each dimension, while preferences are incomparable.</description>
