      <title>Recovering Einstein Mature View of Gravitation: A Dynamical Reconstruction Grounded in the Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The historical and conceptual foundations of General Relativity are revisited, putting the main focus on the physical meaning of the invariant ds, the Equivalence Principle, and the precise interpretation of spacetime geometry. It is argued that Albert Einstein initially sought a dynamical formulation in which ds encoded the gravitational effects, without invoking curvature as a physical entity. The now more familiar geometrical interpretation (identifying gravitation with spacetime curvature) gradually emerged through his collaboration with Marcel Grossmann and the adoption of the Ricci tensor in 1915. Anyhow, in his 1920 Leiden lecture, Einstein explicitly reinterpreted spacetime geometry as the state of a physical medium (an ether endowed with metrical properties but devoid of mechanical substance) thereby actually rejecting geometry as an independent ontological reality.
  Building upon this mature view, gravitation is reconstructed from the Weak Equivalence Principle, understood as the exact compensation between inertial and gravitational forces acting on a body under a uniform gravitational field. From this fundamental principle, together with an extension of Fermat Principle to massive objects, the invariant ds is obtained, first in the static case, where the gravitational potential modifies the flow of proper time. Then, by applying the Lorentz transformation to this static invariant, its general form is derived for the case of matter in motion. The resulting invariant reproduces the relativistic form of Newton second law in proper time and coincides with the weak field limit of General Relativity in the harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this "Boltzmann brain" hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle -- and very often implicit -- joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description>
