      <title>Quantum Lefschetz without curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given one quasi-smooth derived space cut out of another by a section of a 2-term complex of bundles, we give two formulae for its virtual cycle.
  They are modelled on the the $p$-fields construction of Chang-Li and the Quantum Lefschetz principle, and recover these when applied to moduli spaces of (stable or quasi-) maps. When the complex is a single bundle we recover results of Kim-Kresch-Pantev.</description>

      <title>On Real Projective Plane Constructions and Their Isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real projective plane has three well know isomorphic constructions: the extended euclidean plane, unit (hemi)sphere, and three dimensional vector space over the reals. In this paper we find the isomorphisms that map between these three constructions. Additionally we investigate their relationship to direction-sensitive photosensors which use lens(es) to transform light's direction to a position on a local plane. This transformation, done by lenses is a physical version of an isomorphism between projective plane constructions</description>

      <title>Boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations over surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,B)$ be an $\epsilon$-lc pair of dimension $d$ with a closed point $x\in X$. Birkar conjectured that there is an effective Cartier divisor $H$ passing through $x$ such that $(X,B+tH)$ is lc near $x$, where $t$ is a positive real number depending only on $d,\epsilon$. We prove that Birkar's conjecture implies Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations and we confirm Birkar's conjecture in dimension 2. As a corollary, we prove the boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations over surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the equisingular deformation type of a simple real plane sextic curve with smooth real part is determined by its real homological type, \ie, the polarization, exceptional divisors, and real structure recorded in the homology of the covering $K3$-surface. As an illustration, we obtain an equisingular deformation classification of real plane sextics with empty real part (for completeness, we consider the few non-simple ones as well).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Heuer's paper, we consider adic spaces over a de Rham period ring of a perfectoid Tate--Huber ring and their sheafified Riemann--Hilbert correspondence. We will prove that for any smooth adic space $X$ over $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR},\alpha}^+(K,K^+)$, there is a canonical sheaf isomorphism $$R^1\nu_*\left(\mathrm{GL}_r({\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+}_{,\bar{X}}/t^\alpha)\right)\cong t-\mathrm{MIC}_r(X).$$ Moreover, we will define $v$-prestacks of $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-local systems and $t$-connections, and prove that they are small $v$-stacks.</description>

      <title>Atiyah duality for motivic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Atiyah duality holds in the $\infty$-category of non-$\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic spectra over arbitrary derived schemes: every smooth projective scheme is dualizable with dual given by the Thom spectrum of its negative tangent bundle. The Gysin maps recently constructed by L. Tang are a key ingredient in the proof. We then present several applications. First, we study $\mathbb A^1$-colocalization, which transforms any module over the $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sphere into an $\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic spectrum without changing its values on smooth projective schemes. This can be applied to all known $p$-adic cohomology theories and gives a new elementary approach to "logarithmic" or "tame" cohomology theories; it recovers for instance the logarithmic crystalline cohomology of strict normal crossings compactifications over perfect fields and shows that the latter is independent of the choice of compactification. Second, we prove a motivic Landweber exact functor theorem, associating a motivic spectrum to any graded formal group law classified by a flat map to the moduli stack of formal groups. Using this theorem, we compute the ring of $\mathbb P^1$-stable cohomology operations on the algebraic K-theory of qcqs derived schemes, and we prove that rational motivic cohomology is an idempotent motivic spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every reciprocity sheaf gives rise to a cycle (pre)module in the sense of Rost over a perfect field, under mild additional hypotheses. Over a perfect field of positive characteristic, we show that the first cohomology group of a logarithmic de Rham-Witt sheaf has a partial cycle module structure. As a consequence, we show that Kato complexes of logarithmic de Rham-Witt sheaves satisfy functoriality properties similar to Rost's cycle complexes.</description>

      <title>Cohomological flatness over discrete valuation rings: numerical and logarithmic criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give sufficient conditions for cohomological flatness (in dimension 0) over discrete valuation rings, generalising a classical result of Raynaud in two different ways. The first is an extension of Raynaud's numerical criterion to higher dimensions. The second is a logarithmic criterion: we show that a proper, fs log smooth morphism to a log regular discrete valuation ring is cohomologically flat in dimension 0. We apply this latter result to curves and torsors under abelian varieties with good reduction, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the log smoothness of their regular models over arbitrary discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>De Rham $F$-gauges and Shimura varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $F$-gauges for de Rham cohomology of smooth algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. Applying to good reductions of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we recover the Ekedahl-Oort stratifications by constructing universal de Rham $F$-gauges with $G$-structure. We also study the cohomology of de Rham $F$-gauges on these varieties. In particular, in the PEL type case and when the weights of the flat automorphic vector bundles are $p$-small, we determine the $F$-gauge structure on their de Rham cohomology by the associated dual BGG complexes.</description>

In particular, we compute the Hodge number of the vanishing cycle. As a further consequence, we can solve the Birkhoff problem of such a Laurent polynomial by using elementary methods.</description>

Abstract: We prove that to each real singularity $f: (\mathbb{R}^{n}, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^k, 0)$ with $k\geq 2$ one can associate systems of differential equations $\mathfrak{g}^{k}_f$ which are pushforwards in the category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules over $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ of the sheaf of real analytic functions on the total space of the Milnor fibration. We then use this to study Hilbert's 16th problem on polynomial dynamical systems in the plane.</description>

      <title>On the integrality of \'etale extensions of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a valuation theorem for Noetherian rings, recently obtained by Rangachev, to prove that for any non-integral \'etale extension $A\subset B$ of polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the integral closure $\overline{A}$ of $A$ in $B$ has infinite cyclic divisor class group, where the generator is a prime divisor equal to the complement of $\textrm{Spec}(B)$ in $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$. Moreover, this prime divisor coincides with the ramification divisor of the finite extension $A\subset \overline{A}$. We apply this result to carry out Wright's geometric approach for two-dimensional non-integral \'etale extensions. It follows from our main theorem and the work of Miyanishi that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is a smooth affine surface. We show that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is an $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, more precisely a Danilov-Gizatullin surface of index three. Based on Wright's analysis of which of these affine surfaces can factorize an \'etale morphism of the complex affine plane and his description of its affine coordinate rings we prove that any two-dimensional complex \'etale extension is integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem of Hirzebruch, we study closed, symplectic, 8-dimensional manifolds having a Hamiltonian torus action with isolated fixed points and second Betti number equal to 1. Such manifolds are automatically positive monotone. Our main result concerns those endowed with a Hamiltonian $T^2$-action and fourth Betti number equal to 2. We classify their isotropy data, (equivariant) cohomology rings and (equivariant) Chern classes, and prove that they agree with those of certain explicit Fano 4-folds with torus actions. Moreover, under more general assumptions, we prove several finiteness results concerning Betti and Chern numbers of positive monotone, 8-dimensional symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian torus action.</description>

      <title>Entropy of cluster DT transformations and the finite-tame-wild trichotomy of acyclic quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cluster algebra associated with an acyclic quiver has a special mutation loop $\tau$, called the cluster Donaldson--Thomas (DT) transformation, related to the Auslander--Reiten translation. In this paper, we characterize the finite-tame-wild trichotomy for acyclic quivers by the sign stability of $\tau$ introduced in [IK21] and its cluster stretch factor. As an application, we compute several kinds of entropies of $\tau$ and other mutation loops. In particular, we show that the algebraic and categorical entropies of $\tau$ are commonly given by the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter matrix associated with the quiver, and that any mutation loop of finite or tame acyclic quivers have zero algebraic entropy.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present results on the classification of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear MRD codes of dimension three. In particular, using connections with certain algebraic varieties over finite fields, we provide non-existence results for MRD codes $\mathcal{C}=\langle x^{q^t}, F(x), G(x) \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{L}_{n,q}$ of exceptional type, i.e. such that $\mathcal{C}$ is MRD over infinite many extensions of the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$. These results partially address a conjecture of Bartoli, Zini and Zullo in 2023.</description>

Abstract: We are extending results from \cite{B-Hurwitz} by building a parallel theory of simple Hurwitz numbers for the reflection groups $G(m,1,n)$. We also study analogs of the cut-and-join operators. An algebraic description as well as a description in terms of ramified covering of Hurwitz numbers is provided. An explicit formula for them in terms of Schur polynomials are provided. In addition the generating function of $G(m,1,n)$-Hurwitz numbers is shown to give rise to $m$ independent variables $\tau$-function of the KP hierarchy. Finally we provide an ELSV-formula type for these new Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Rational distances from given rational points in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider sets of points in the plane with rational distances from a prescribed finite set of $n$ rational points. We show that for $n\le 3$, the points are dense in the real topology. On the other hand, for $n\ge 4$, we show that they correspond to rational points in a surface of general type, hence conjecturally degenerate. However, at the present, we lack methods to prove this, given the fact that the surface is simply-connected, as we shall show. We give explicit proofs as well as describe in detail the geometry of the surfaces involved. In addition we discuss certain cases of density of points with distances in certain ring of integers.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Methods for Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex optimization encompasses a wide range of optimization problems, containing many efficiently solvable subclasses. Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for the feasible sets. In this work, we introduce an alternative method for tackling convex optimization problems, employing a homotopy. With this technique, the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem is continuously transformed into the target one, while tracking the solutions. We conduct an analysis of this approach, focusing on its application to semidefinite programs, hyperbolic programs, and convex optimization problems with a single convexity constraint. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several interesting cases.</description>

      <title>The distribution of Weierstrass points on a tropical curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.07920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that on a metric graph of genus $g$, a divisor of degree $n$ generically has $g(n-g+1)$ Weierstrass points. For a sequence of generic divisors on a metric graph whose degrees grow to infinity, we show that the associated Weierstrass points become distributed according to the Zhang canonical measure. In other words, the limiting distribution is determined by effective resistances on the metric graph. This distribution result has an analogue for complex algebraic curves, due to Neeman, and for curves over non-Archimedean fields, due to Amini.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.10262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a notion of formal groups in the filtered setting and describe a duality relating these to a specified class of filtered Hopf algebras. We then study a deformation to the normal cone construction in the setting of derived algebraic geometry. Applied to the unit section of a formal group $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$, this provides a $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant degeneration of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ to its tangent Lie algebra. We prove a unicity result on complete filtrations, which, in particular, identifies the resulting filtration on the coordinate algebra of this deformation with the adic filtration on the coordinate algebra of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. We use this in a special case, together with the aforementioned notion of Cartier duality, to recover the filtration on the filtered circle of [MRT19]. Finally, we investigate some properties of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$-Hochschild homology set out in loc. cit., and describe "lifts" of these invariants to the setting of spectral algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite orbits in affine flag varieties and homology of affine Springer fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field $k$, and let $Fl$ be the affine flag variety of $G$. For every regular semisimple element $\gamma$ of $G(k((t)))$, the affine Springer fiber $Fl_{\gamma}$ can be presented as a union of closed subvarieties $Fl^{\leq w}_{\gamma}$, defined as the intersection of $Fl_{\gamma}$ with an affine Schubert variety $Fl^{\leq w}$.
  The main result of this paper asserts that if elements $w_1,\ldots,w_n$ are sufficiently regular, then the natural map $H_i(\bigcup_{j=1}^n Fl^{\leq w_j}_{\gamma})\to H_i(Fl_{\gamma})$ is injective for every $i\in{\mathbb Z}$. It plays an important role in our work [BV]. One can view this statement as providing a categorification of the notion of a weighted orbital integral. Along the way we also show that every affine Schubert variety can be written as an intersection of closures of semi-infinite orbits.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the cohomology rings of the moduli space $M_{d,\chi}$ of one-dimensional sheaves on the projective plane are not isomorphic for general different choices of the Euler characteristics. This stands in contrast to the $\chi$-independence of the Betti numbers of these moduli spaces. As a corollary, we deduce that $M_{d,\chi}$ are topologically different unless they are related by obvious symmetries, strengthening a previous result of Woolf distinguishing them as algebraic varieties.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of complex Kuranishi structures on projective schemes. These are sufficiently rigid to be equivalent to weak perfect obstruction theories, but sufficiently flexible to admit global complex Kuranishi charts.
  We apply the theory to projective moduli spaces M of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Using real derived differential geometry, Borisov-Joyce produced a virtual homology cycle on M. In the prequel to this paper we constructed an algebraic virtual cycle on M. We prove the cycles coincide in homology after inverting 2 in the coefficients. And when Borisov-Joyce's real virtual dimension is odd, their virtual cycle is 2-torsion.</description>

Abstract: Given a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration of a compact hyperkahler manifold, we use the differential geometry of the special Kahler metric that exists on the base away from the discriminant locus, and show that the pullback of the tangent bundle of the base to the total space of a family of minimal rational curves admits a parallel splitting. The splitting is nontrivial when the base is not half-dimensional projective space. Combining this with results of Voisin, Hwang and Bakker-Schnell, we deduce that the base must be projective space, a result first proved by Hwang.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the height of K-semistable Fano varieties II, the log case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work we conjectured - inspired by an algebro-geometric result of Fujita - that the height of an arithmetic Fano variety X of relative dimension $n$ is maximal when X is the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$ over the integers, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, if the corresponding complex Fano variety is K-semistable. In this work the conjecture is settled for diagonal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. The proof is based on a logarithmic extension of our previous conjecture, of independent interest, which is established for toric log Fano varieties of relative dimension at most three, hyperplane arrangements on $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$, as well as for general arithmetic orbifold Fano surfaces.</description>

Abstract: This is a sequel of our previous work, arXiv:2209.09686, on the development of derived contact geometry, in which we formally introduced shifted contact structures on derived stacks and proved some results for $k$-shifted contact derived schemes, with $k&lt;0$. In this paper, we extend these results from derived schemes to derived Artin stacks. In brief, we first show that for $k&lt;0$, every $k$-shifted contact derived Artin stack admits a contact Darboux atlas. Secondly, we canonically describe the symplectification of a derived Artin stack equipped with a $k$-shifted contact structure, where $k&lt;0$. Lastly, we give several constructions of contact derived stacks using certain cotangent stacks and shifted prequantization structures.</description>

As a corollary, we show that the $p$-multiplication map (where $p$ is a prime) on an abelian variety is incompressible when $p&gt;\dim A$ or when $\dim A\le 4$. This confirms a conjecture of Brosnan for most primes.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between continuous K-theory and integral cohomology of rigid spaces. Given a rigid analytic space over a complete discretely valued field, its continuous K-groups vanish in degrees below the negative of the dimension. Likewise, the cohomology groups vanish in degrees above the dimension. The main result provides the existence of an isomorphism between the lowest possibly non-vanishing continuous K-group and the highest possibly non-vanishing cohomology group with integral coefficients. A key role in the proof is played by a comparison between cohomology groups of an admissible Zariski-Riemann space with respect to different topologies; namely, the rh-topology which is related to K-theory as well as the Zariski topology whereon the cohomology groups in question rely.</description>

Abstract: Genus Theory is a classical feature of integral binary quadratic forms. Using the author's generalization of the well-known correspondence between quadratic form classes and ideal classes of quadratic algebras, we extend it to the case when quadratic forms are twisted and have coefficients in any PID $R$. When ${R = \mathbb{K}[X]}$, we show that the Genus Theory map is the quadratic form version of the $2$-descent map on a certain hyperelliptic curve. As an application, we make a contribution to a question of Agboola and Pappas regarding a specialization problem of divisor classes on hyperelliptic curves. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of non-trivial specializations has density $1$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the programme on mirror symmetry for non-K\"ahler manifolds, we construct representations of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra associated to solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. The construction is via embeddings of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra in the chiral de Rham complex of a string Courant algebroid. Our results require that the connection $\nabla$, one of the unknowns of the system, is Hermitian-Yang-Mills. Our main theorem proves that any solution of the Hull-Strominger system satisfying this condition has an associated $N=2$ embedding.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove that for a definable set in an o-minimal structure with connected link (at 0 or infinity), the inner distance of the link is equivalent to the inner distance of the set restricted to the link. With this result, we obtain several consequences. We present also several relations between the local and the global Lipschitz geometry of singularities. For instance, we prove that two sets in Euclidean spaces, not necessarily definable in an o-minimal structure, are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their stereographic modifications are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their inversions are outer lipeomorphic.</description>

      <title>On Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences and related Gr\"{o}bner bases</title>

Abstract: Gr\"{o}bner bases are nowadays central tools for solving various problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. A typical use of Gr\"{o}bner bases is the multivariate polynomial system solving, which enables us to construct algebraic attacks against post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Therefore, the determination of the complexity of computing Gr\"{o}bner bases is very important both in theory and in practice: One of the most important cases is the case where input polynomials compose an (overdetermined) affine semi-regular sequence. The first part of this paper aims to present a survey on Gr\"{o}bner basis computation and its complexity. In the second part, we shall give an explicit formula on the (truncated) Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series associated to the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence. Based on the formula, we also study (reduced) Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideals generated by an affine semi-regular sequence and its homogenization. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence.</description>

      <title>WDVV-based recursion for open Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a computability result for open Gromov-Witten invariants based on open WDVV equations. This is analogous to the result of Kontsevich-Manin for closed Gromov-Witten invariants. For greater generality, we base the argument on a formal object, the Frobenius superpotential, that generalizes several different definitions of open Gromov-Witten invariants. As an application, we show that open Gromov-Witten invariants for some products of projective spaces vanish.</description>
