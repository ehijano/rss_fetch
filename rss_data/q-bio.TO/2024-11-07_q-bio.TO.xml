      <title>Advancements in Nanoparticle-based Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probes for Cancer Specific Imaging Applications</title>

Abstract: Infrared (IR) dyes, especially those within the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, offer substantial advantages for in vivo imaging, owing to their deep tissue penetration and minimal background autofluorescence. Nanoparticles incorporating these IR dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG) have undergone extensive investigation regarding their pharmacokinetic behavior, including biodistribution patterns and clearance mechanisms. These nanoparticles often preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues, primarily through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby establishing them as potent instruments for sophisticated tumor imaging and precision-targeted drug delivery systems. The development of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for large-scale tissue imaging is attributed to its ability to generate highly specific, targeted visualization of organs. The distinctive properties of the near-infrared spectrum, including its selective absorption by biomolecules that bind to specific sites within tissues, minimal autofluorescence, and reduced light scattering, make it an appealing option for cancer imaging. Unlike the conventional structural imaging system, molecular imaging leverages these properties to differentiate between malignant and normal tissues at the molecular level, offering a more refined and precise diagnostic capability. This review offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in Nanoparticle-based NIRF probes and multifunctional agents for cancer molecular imaging. These advances will extend the current concepts of cancer theranostics by NIRF imaging.</description>
