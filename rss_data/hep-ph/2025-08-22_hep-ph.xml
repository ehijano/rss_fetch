      <title>Multi-top signals of vectorlike quarks at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that events with 6 or more top quarks may be observed at the LHC if certain particles exist at the TeV scale. In a model where a vectorlike quark of charge 2/3 decays into a top quark and a pseudoscalar particle, which subsequently decays into a top-antitop pair, the LHC production cross section for events with 6 top quarks may be above 10 fb. If the pseudoscalar is part of a complex scalar field, then longer cascade decays, involving the scalar partner, may lead to events with 8 or even 10 top quarks. We show that for a region of parameter space the dominant LHC signal in this model is 8 top quarks (i.e., four $t\bar t $ pairs). The ensuing signals would be spectacular, including many leptons and $b$ jets. A discovery in that case would allow several cross section measurements that may determine the masses of all three new particles.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO SMEFT Electroweak Corrections to Higgs Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise predictions for Higgs decays are a crucial ingredient of the search for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a valuable tool for quantifying deviations from the Standard Model (SM). We present the complete set of predictions for the 2- and 3- body Higgs decays at next-to-leading order (NLO), considering QCD and electroweak corrections and including all contributions from the dimension-6 SMEFT operators and with an arbitrary flavor structure. Including the NLO SMEFT results for Higgs decays greatly increases the sensitivity to BSM physics of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow Zh$ process at FCC-ee, as compared with that obtained using only the total cross section.</description>

      <title>One Phase to Rule Them All: Spontaneous CP Violation and Leptogenesis in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a renormalizable $SO(10)$ grand unified theory with a minimal Yukawa sector consisting of a $126_H$, a real $10_H$ and a real $120_H$, where $CP$ violation has a spontaneous origin. We show that the Yukawa sector in this setup, which consists of only 19 real parameters, is capable of simultaneously reproducing the observed fermion masses and mixings, including neutrino oscillations, as well as the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via thermal leptogenesis. In this framework, $CP$ is spontaneously broken when a $CP$-odd Higgs field $54_H$, used for GUT symmetry breaking, acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. All $CP$-violating phases, including the Dirac phases $\delta_\mathrm{CKM}$ and $\delta_\mathrm{PMNS}$, the neutrino Majorana phases, as well as those responsible for leptogenesis, arise solely from a single complex parameter in the Higgs potential. The proposed minimal setup predicts a normal ordering of neutrino masses, with the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ preferred in the first octant and the leptonic $\delta_{\mathrm{PMNS}}$ lying in the range $(-38^\circ,\, +31^\circ)$. The fermion fits in our scenario further yield a strongly hierarchical mass spectrum for the three right-handed neutrinos, $(M_1,\,M_2,\,M_3) \sim \left(10^{5},\, 10^{12},\, 5\cdot 10^{14}\right)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which is shown to result in successful $N_2$-dominated leptogenesis, consistent with current cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Spurion Analysis for Non-Invertible Selection Rules from Near-Group Fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the framework of spurion analysis to a class of selection rules arising from non-invertible fusion algebras in perturbation theory. As a first step toward systematic applications to particle physics, we analyze the near-group fusion algebras, defined by fusion rules built from a finite Abelian group $G$ extended by a single non-invertible element. Notable examples include the Fibonacci and Ising fusion rules. We introduce a systematic scheme for labeling coupling constants at the level of the non-invertible fusion algebra, enabling consistent tracking of couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks. Our labeling provides a clear interpretation of why the tree-level exact non-invertible selection rules are violated through radiative corrections, a unique phenomenon essential to ``loop-induced groupification''. We also identify the limit where the near-group fusion algebra is lifted to a $G\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ group, which provides an alternative scheme of spurion analysis consistent with the original one based on the near-group algebra. Meanwhile, we highlight the distinctions between the selection rules imposed by the near-group fusion algebra and those from breaking the $G\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ group.</description>

      <title>Classical constant electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constant classical electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space, with potential implications for magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production. Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes of $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ including pentaquark components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <title>Dilepton Spectra and Even Flow Harmonics in a Magnetized QGP: An Ideal Hydrodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of dilepton production from a hot, magnetized quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions (HIC), incorporating realistic, time-dependent, and spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles within an analytically solvable Gubser flow background. This framework provides a significant improvement over previous static calculations with homogeneous fields and moves toward the long-term goal of full $3+1$D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We explore the effects of impact parameter, electrical conductivity, and invariant mass on the dilepton spectra and anisotropic even flow coefficients. It is found that transverse momentum spectra increase with impact parameter, dominated by annihilation processes, while decay contributions remain sub-leading. Strikingly, the elliptic flow $v_2$ from decay channels is nonzero even in nearly central collisions, exhibiting a characteristic shape--positive at low $p_T$ and negative at high $p_T$--that is largely independent of impact parameter and conductivity. In contrast, $v_2$ from annihilation processes is smaller in magnitude but dominates the total flow in magnitude due to its larger yield. Higher harmonics, such as $v_4$, are an order of magnitude smaller as compared to $v_2$ along with distinctive zero-crossing patterns. Conductivity enhances both spectra and flow but leaves no unambiguous signature for its extraction. Varying the invariant mass reveals the strongest enhancements at low mass, with harmonic coefficients suppressed at higher masses. Overall, our results suggest that central and semi-central collisions can carry imprints of the background magnetic field, and that characteristic correlations in even flow harmonics may provide a robust probe of electromagnetic effects in HICs.</description>

      <title>Potential of di-Higgs observation via a calibratable jet-free $HH\to 4b$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calibratable, jet-free framework that enhances the search significance of the flagship LHC channel $HH \to 4b$ by more than a factor of five compared to existing approaches. The method employs a mass-decorrelated discriminant to identify $h_1 h_2 \to 4b$ with variable $h_{1,2}$ masses and a simultaneous estimator of $(m_{h_1}, m_{h_2})$, both derived from multiclass classification on all-particle inputs. The $HH$ signal response can be calibrated using $ZZ \to 4b$. Using a highly realistic simulation framework validated through multiple tests, we demonstrate the method's robustness and identify two prerequisites essential for achieving this level of sensitivity. Results indicate that with LHC Run 2 and 3 data, observation-level sensitivity to $HH$ appears within reach, enabling constraints on $\kappa_\lambda$ comparable to HL-LHC projections and offering an accelerated path to precision measurements of the Higgs trilinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Determination of the pion generalized parton distributions at zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of the pion electromagnetic form factor (FF) data from pion electroproduction and elastic pion scattering to extract the valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness. The analysis uses three different sets of pion parton distribution functions (PDFs), namely xFitter, JAM21, and MAP23, to construct the GPD ansatz. Through a $\chi^2$ minimization and a careful parametrization scan, we determine the profile function parameters and find that only two parameters are sufficient to describe the data. The extracted valence pion GPDs from different analyses have similar $x$-dependence, with minor differences at small momentum transfer. The resulting theoretical predictions for the pion electromagnetic FF and its squared magnitude show good agreement with experimental measurements. Among the three analyses, the one using the MAP23 PDFs provides the best overall fit and is adopted as the final GPD set. Our results offer a consistent determination of the valence pion GPDs, indicating a minor impact of the choice of pion PDFs. The present study provides a solid foundation for future investigations of pion structure, including its charge radius, tomography, and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>The $\sin(2\phi)$ azimuthal asymmetry in exclusive $\pi^0$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sin(2\phi)$ azimuthal angular correlation between the transverse momenta of the scattered electron and the recoil proton in the $ep\to e^\prime p^\prime \pi^0$ process provides a probe for quark orbital angular momentum. We numerically calculate this asymmetry for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in the U.S. and China (EicC) kinematics using a light-front quark-scalar-diquark model, in which the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) are derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD framework. We also investigate the properties of the valence quark angular momentum expressed in terms of helicity-independent and helicity-dependent parton distributions. This study aims to establish theoretical constraints on the asymmetry sensitive to the quark orbital angular momentum prior to its first experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)\to D_s\pi^0$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For coupled channels $D^0K^+$, $D^+K^0$, $D_s^+\eta$, and $D_s^+\pi^0$, the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes are constructed taking into account the mixing of the isoscalar resonance $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+$ with nonresonance amplitudes with isospin $I=1$. The phenomenological approach we use allows us to quite simply clear up the general structure of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay amplitude violating isospin. We show that the phase of this amplitude coincides with the phase of the nonresonanct $D_s^+\pi^0 $ scattering amplitude in agreement with the Watson theorem. Its modulus squared, as it should be, determines the width of the resonance peak in the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel. Taking into account the $\pi^0-\eta$ mixing in internal lines up to the second order inclusively ensures that the unitarity condition is fulfilled. The presented analysis complements the description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317 )^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay based on the coupled channel unitarized chiral perturbation theory. The numerical estimates obtained by us for the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay width do not contradict those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transversity Generalized Parton Distributions of $\Delta$ with the Diquark Spectator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show quark transversity generalized parton pistributions (GPDs) of $\Delta^+$ isobar by using the diquark spectator model for the first time. First, this model is tested by electric charge, magnetic-dipole and axial charge form factors, and it is used for calculating the transversity GPDs $H^{qT}_{1,3,5,7}$ of $\Delta^+$. The quark transversity distribution $h_1$ is then obtained from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit. Then, helicity-flip amplitudes are shown numerically by using relations between the helicity amplitudes and the GPDs. Finally, by taking first moments of the GPDs, tensor form factors are obtained and we predict the tensor charge. Experimentally, $N$-$\Delta$ transition GPDs are investigated in deeply virtual Compton scattering and virtual meson-production processes, and generalized distribution amplitudes, which correspond to the $s$-channel GPDs, could be investigated by the two-photon processes $\gamma^* \gamma \to \Delta \bar\Delta$ at the electron-positron colliders. Therefore, the spin-3/2 $\Delta$ GPDs could become interesting quantities experimentally in future.</description>

      <title>Study of Particle Production in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 11.5-200 GeV Using HYDJET++ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the HYDJET++ model, we study the production of multi-strange particles($\phi$ and $\Omega$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 200 GeV as functions of transverse momentum and centrality. The model calculations employ earlier freeze-out hypersurfaces for multi-strange particle production and are compared with STAR experimental data. Results indicate that the HYDJET++ model demonstrates a better agreement with experimental data for multi-strange particles at higher energies, particularly in relation to early thermal freeze-out. Meanwhile, the default version performs more accurately for lighter, non-strange particles at the same energy scales. We also analyze identified particle and mixed particle ratios, providing insights into strangeness enhancement. The results provide additional constraints on parton energy loss models, contributing to a more precise determination of the transport properties of hot and dense QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with an emergent Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss new ideas that the Standard Model might be emergent with connection to electroweak vacuum stability and related consequences for cosmology. In this scenario, the gauge symmetries and particles of the Standard Model would be ``born'' in some phase transition at a large scale about $10^{16}$ GeV with the Standard Model parameters constrained by the requirement of vacuum stability.Emergent gauge symmetries are well known in condensed matter physics. Perhaps the Standard Model might also be emergent. In this case the particles would be the stable long range excitations of degrees of freedom that operate above the scale of emergence. The dark energy scale comes out with similar size to the tiny masses of light Majorana neutrinos. The emergence scenario comes with interesting constraints on possible dark matter structure. New physics at energy scales around $10^{16}$ GeV might be explored through its effects in the neutrino mass matrix plus using high frequency gravitational waves and polarisation observables in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {In the Standard Model of elementary particles the fermions are assumed to be intrinsically massless. Here we propose a new theoretical idea of fermion mass generation (other than by the Higgs mechanism) through the coupling with the vector gauge fields of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge symmetry, especially with the $Z$ boson of the weak interaction that affects all elementary fermions. The resulting small masses are suggested to be proportional to the self-energy of the $Z$ field as described by a Yukawa potential. Thereby the electrically neutral neutrino just gets a tiny mass through its $Z$-field coupling. In contrast, the electrically charged electron and quarks can become more massive by the inertia induced through the Coulomb energy of the electrostatic fields surrounding them in their rest frames.</description>

      <title>Quark polarization and transverse momentum effects on double quarkonium production in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of double quarkonia ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon$ mesons) in polarized hadron-hadron collisions, considering the kinematic configuration where the transverse momentum of each pair of bound states is much smaller than its invariant mass. Supported by nonrelativistic QCD arguments, we adopt the Color-Singlet Model for the quarkonium formation mechanism and assume the validity of transverse momentum dependent factorization. In strong analogy with dilepton production in the Drell-Yan processes, the azimuthal modulations of the cross section, calculated to the order $\alpha_s^4$ in the QCD coupling constant, can be expressed as convolutions of transverse momentum dependent distributions of light quarks and antiquarks inside the incoming hadrons. By adopting very recent parameterizations of these distributions, we show that a phenomenological study of these quantities in $\pi^-p\to J/\psi\,J/\psi\,X $ in the kinematic region covered by the COMPASS and AMBER fixed-target experiments at CERN, where the gluon contribution is found to be negligible, would provide direct access to the quark distributions. In particular, this will offer the possibility of a further sign change test of the quark Sivers function of the proton. The impact of our findings on similar studies about the gluon content of the proton in present and future fixed-target experiments at the LHC, like SMOG and LHCspin, is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Sterile Neutrino as a Probe of Neutrino Mass Generation in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal left-right symmetric model (mLRSM) provides an elegant and testable framework for addressing the origin of neutrino masses. We examine the constraints on the sub-GeV sterile neutrino in the type-II seesaw scenario of the mLRSM without left-right mixing, taking limits from collider searches, meson decays, supernovae, neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and cosmology. Specifically, we derive the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay constraints using the advanced effective field theory approach and up-to-date nuclear matrix element calculations. Besides, we update the SN1987A cooling bound with the state-of-the-art simulations, provide new constraints from the energy deposition in the supernova ejecta, and incorporate the stringent sterile neutrino lifetime upper limit $\tau\lesssim 0.023$ s from the big bang nucleosynthesis. Our results identify the parameter region compatible with all current experimental and observational constraints, where the sterile neutrino mass lies between 700 MeV and 1 GeV and the right-handed $W$ boson mass is slightly below 20 TeV. This region is exclusively probed by the future tonne-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments, providing a unique window to test the mLRSM and the possible origin of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>The recoil corrections, correlation functions and possible double-strange hadronic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of ${K}^{(*)}{K}^{(*)}$ interactions within a one-boson-exchange model.The framework incorporates both $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects, with effective potentials retained up to order $\mathcal{O}(1/M^2)$. By solving the coupled channel Schr\"{o}dinger equations, we can predict two double-strange molecular candidates: a $KK^*$ molecule with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ and a $K^*K^*$ molecule with $0(1^+)$. Our results also show that the recoil corrections play a crucial role in the formation of these two molecular candidates. Furthermore, the $S-D$ wave mixing effects contribute positively to the formation process. As a byproduct of this analysis, we extend our study to $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ interactions with the same model. Our findings suggest that the $K\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(1^{+-}, 1^{++})$ and $K^{*}\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++})$ can be promising molecular candidates. Additionally, we analyze the correlations between the constituent mesons, the resulting correlation functions provide additional support for our predictions of both double-strange and strangonium-like molecular states.</description>

      <title>New rephasing invariants and CP violation built from the trios of the CKM or PMNS matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the $3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark flavor mixing matrix $V$, we define a new set of rephasing invariants in terms of the "trios" of its nine elements: $\lozenge^{ijk}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \equiv (V^{}_{\alpha i} V^{}_{\beta j} V^{}_{\gamma k})/\det V$ with $\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma$ and $i \neq j \neq k$ running respectively over $(u, c, t)$ and $(d, s, b)$. We find that ${\rm Im} \lozenge^{ijk}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = - {\cal J}$ holds, where ${\cal J}$ is the well-known Jarlskog invariant of weak CP violation. Analogous rephasing invariants $\blacklozenge^{ijk}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \equiv (U^{}_{\alpha I} U^{}_{\beta j} U^{}_{\gamma k})/\det U$ can be defined for the $3\times 3$ Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$, where $\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma$ and $i \neq j \neq k$ run respectively over $(e, \mu, \tau)$ and $(1, 2, 3)$. Taking into account small non-unitarity of $U$ based on the canonical seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation, we calculate ${\rm Im} \blacklozenge^{ijk}_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure and demonstrate that their leading terms converge to a universal invariant ${\cal J}^{}_\nu$ in the unitarity limit of $U$.</description>

      <title>Spin versus Magic: Lessons from Gluon and Graviton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum property of non-stabiliserness, also known as magic, plays a key role in designing quantum computing systems. How to produce, manipulate and enhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical systems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study two-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and General Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides an interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin of the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and also show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases. The maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known upper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to the known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their respective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights into understanding magic in other systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>High-precision determination of radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superallowed $0^+\rightarrow 0^+$ transitions between $T=1$ nuclei have been a perfect avenue avenue for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, which imposes powerful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. For a long time, the precision of $V_{ud}$ has been limited by uncertainties in radiative corrections that arise from non-perturbative strong interaction physics at both the hadronic and nuclear levels. In this talk, I will describe some recent efforts to pin down these corrections by combining dispersive analysis with experimental data, lattice QCD, and nuclear many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Globular Clusters to Diffuse Gamma-ray Emission from Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) provides a valuable probe for investigating the cosmic ray propagation and interactions within our Galactic environment. Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions. While $\gamma$-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE. Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only $\sim$2\% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than $1\%$ in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Solutions of the Quantum Kinetic Equations in the Presence of Matter Density Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of fluctuations in the matter density on neutrino flavor evolution by studying their effects on the collision terms in the spherically symmetric quantum kinetics equations (QKEs). We solve the QKEs with varying radial resolution ($r_{\mathrm{bins}} = 150 \, , 1500 \, , 15000$) to assess numerical convergence in angular distributions, number densities, and energy spectra for four neutrino flavors ($\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, $\nu_x$, $\bar{\nu}_x$). Our results demonstrate that the solutions are numerically converged already at the coarsest resolution, with higher resolutions yielding almost identical outcomes. We introduce random perturbations to each radial bin, thus adding perturbations with a length scale that is related to the radial resolution. We study both time-independent and time-dependent perturbations to the matter density that affect the collision term and analyze their effects on neutrino flavor evolution. We find that such fluctuations do not induce any significant instabilities or qualitative changes in flavor evolution. Angular structure remains robust, and flavor-dependent number densities and energy spectra show only minor deviations compared to the unperturbed case. These findings suggest that matter perturbations have a negligible effect on neutrino flavor evolution in spherically symmetric settings.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $s\to u$ weak decays of heavy flavor hadrons play a unique role in the field of heavy flavor physics. In this work, we investigate semileptonic $s\to u$ decays of singly heavy baryons in the light-front approach under the three-quark picture. Firstly, we provide all the form factors using this quark model, especially for $f_{3}$ and $g_{3}$, which are usually considered non-extractable in recent literature. We also discuss the heavy quark limit for the form factors, and some of our results differ from those in the literature. We find that, when considering the heavy quark limit, the $m_{s}$ correction may not be negligible. Secondly, we apply the obtained form factors to predict some observables in semileptonic decays. It is worth noting that, due to the extremely small phase space, lepton flavor universality (LFU) is sensitive to the masses of leptons, and precise measurement of LFU is expected to be an important tool for testing the standard model.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections to QCD $\theta$ angle from evanescent operator in the BMHV scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of the QCD $\theta$ angle at the two-loop level focusing on divergent and finite $CP$-violating contributions from evanescent operators, using dimensional regularization with the BMHV scheme. When one considers the Lagrangian in $d$-dimensional space-time instead of four dimensions in dimensional regularization, evanescent operators that break the chiral symmetry are induced. Consequently, $T$-odd and $P$-odd fermion loops in the BMHV scheme generate evanescent contributions to the QCD $\theta$ angle. We carefully classify the evanescent contributions into two types: one originating from the evanescent operators at the one-loop level and the other directly produced by two-loop calculations. We show that renormalization of the parameters in the BMHV scheme keeps removing those unphysical contributions to the QCD $\theta$ angle at any scale at the two-loop level. We also discuss how the rephasing invariance of the radiative correction to the QCD $\theta$ angle is realized in the BMHV scheme.</description>

      <title>Search for CP Violations in the Production and Decay of the Hyperon-Antihyperon Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a complete joint angular distribution analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\to B(\to B_1\pi)\bar{B}(\to \bar{B}_1\pi)$ with polarized beams, where $B$ and $B_{1}$ are hyperons. We consider both transverse and longitudinal beam polarization and analyze CP violation in the production and decay of hyperons. We present the complete Fisher information matrix for the sensitivities of the weak decay parameters $\alpha_{-},~\alpha_{+},~\phi_{\Xi}$ and $\bar{\phi}_{\Xi}$, the P-violating term $F_{A}$, and the EDM $d_{B}$ (derived from the CP-violating term $H_{T}$), under the BESIII and STCF statistics. We find that polarization enhances the sensitivity of the parameters. Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides a more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the enhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multi-step decays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated EDM sensitivities for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of $10^{-19}~e~\rm cm$, while those for $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ are $10^{-18}~e~\rm cm$. Furthermore, the STCF experiment is expected to improve these estimates by $1\sim2$ orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon ($TJJ$) vertex, extending previous investigations carried out in both QED and QCD. Within the framework of a non-Abelian gauge theory, we extract the conformal anomaly form factor from the trace component of the correlator and demonstrate that it satisfies a one-loop sum rule, valid under the most general kinematic conditions. Analogously to the chiral and chiral-gravitational cases, a spectral flow emerges in which the exchanged intermediate state becomes localized at zero invariant mass along the graviton line as the quark mass approaches zero. The total integral of the spectral density precisely reproduces the anomaly. We examine how the behaviour of these spectral densities evolves as the system approaches the conformal limit with on-shell gluons. The perturbative analysis reveals that such sum rules are fundamental dynamical features of anomaly-induced interactions. In particular, the appearance or absence of associated dilaton poles is closely tied to whether the sum rule is saturated by a pole contribution or by a dispersive continuum. In the conformal, on-shell limit, the particle-pole interaction yields a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. Also, the role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Implementing Errors on Errors: Bayesian vs Frequentist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When combining apparently inconsistent experimental results, one often implements errors on errors. The Particle Data Group's phenomenological prescription offers a practical solution but lacks a firm theoretical foundation. To address this, D'Agostini and Cowan have proposed Bayesian and frequentist approaches, respectively, both introducing gamma-distributed auxiliary variables to model uncertainty in quoted errors. In this Letter, we show that these two formulations admit a parameter-by-parameter correspondence, and are structurally equivalent. This identification clarifies how Bayesian prior choices can be interpreted in terms of frequentist sampling assumptions, providing a unified probabilistic framework for modeling uncertainty in quoted variances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <title>Entropy, purity and gluon cascades at high energies with recombinations and transitions to vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one dimensional dipole cascade models in the high-energy limit of QCD. Motivated by data on hadron multiplicities in the LHCb kinematical range, we generalize existing cascade models for splitting and recombination to account also for transitions to the vacuum. This modification allows us to describe the data. Furthermore, we perform both analytical and numerical studies of the cascades and find that the cascade including loop corrections, as well as the one accounting for transitions to the vacuum, can both be related to the Negative Binomial Distribution. In the latter case, however, one must properly normalize the cascade to account for transitions to the vacuum. We also study the scaling properties of the cascades and identify new regimes, which we call "focal" and "parallel." Finally, we investigate the Quantum Information (QI) measures of the cascades, which allow us to highlight their distinctive properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NNLO QCD predictions for a wide range of event-shape observables in hadronic Higgs decays, taking into account the two dominant decay modes $H\to gg$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$. Specifically, we consider the six classical event shapes thrust, heavy jet mass, $C$-parameter, total and wide jet broadening, and the three-jet resolution $y_{23}$ in the Durham algorithm. We also present results for the soft-drop variant of thrust. Decays of the Higgs boson to two gluons are treated in the heavy-top limit, whereas decays to a bottom-quark pair are mediated by a non-vanishing Yukawa coupling, despite considering kinematically massless quarks. Our results highlight the importance of NNLO QCD corrections in the calculation of event-shape observables and provide means to quantify the intrinsic difference between the two Higgs decay modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using trapped electrons as high-$Q$ resonators for detecting meV dark photon dark matter. When the rest energy of the dark photon matches the energy splitting of the two lowest cyclotron levels, the first excited state of the electron cyclotron will be resonantly excited. A proof-of-principle measurement, carried out with one electron, demonstrates that the method is background-free over a 7.4 day search. It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints. Dark photon dark matter in the 0.1-1 meV mass range (20-200 GHz) could likely be detected at a similar sensitivity in an apparatus designed for dark photon detection.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron-star mergers: coincident detection prospects with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers are accompanied by multi-messenger emissions, including gravitational wave (GW), neutrino, and electromagnetic signals. Some fraction of BNS mergers may result in a rapidly spinning magnetar as a remnant, which can enhance both the EM and neutrino emissions. In this study, we model the neutrino emissions from such systems and discuss the prospects for detecting the neutrinos coincident with GW signatures. We consider a scenario where a magnetar remnant drives a pulsar wind using its spin energy. The wind interacts with the surrounding kilonova ejecta, forming a nebula filled with non-thermal photons. Ions and nuclei extracted from the magnetar's surface can be accelerated in the polar-cap and the termination-shock regions. We investigate the neutrino fluences resulting from photomeson interactions, where accelerated CR protons interact with the photons in the nebula. Our findings indicate that the peak neutrino fluence is $\sim 10^{-2}\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$ for a source at $40$ Mpc, which is reached approximately $\mathcal{O}( 1-10\ {\rm days})$ post merger. Finally, we examine the potential for GW-triggered stacking searches with IceCube-Gen2 using next-generation GW detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We conclude that, assuming an optimistic neutrino emission model, a combination of CE+ET would offer a high probability of neutrino detection from these sources within an operational timescale of $\sim 20$ years. In case of non-detection, $2 \sigma$ level constraints on model parameters can be established within similar joint operation timescales.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential equations for the elliptic two-loop five-point integral family relevant to $t\bar t +$jet production at leading colour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present differential equations (DEs) in canonical form for a family of two-loop five-point Feynman integrals containing elliptic functions and nested square roots. This is the only family for which canonical DEs were not yet available among those required to compute the two-loop leading-colour amplitude for top-pair production in association with a jet at hadron colliders. We write the DEs in terms of one-forms having (locally) simple poles at all singular points, and highlight the `duplet' structure that generalises the even/odd charge of square roots to nested roots. All transcendental functions in the DEs are expressed in closed form using complete elliptic integrals, while one-forms free of elliptic functions are given in terms of logarithms, including those with the nested roots. In addition to marking a significant step towards next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for an important LHC process, this work represents the first time that a canonical basis of integrals involving elliptic functions has been obtained for a five-particle process.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron star mergers: prospects for unique identification using multi-wavelength signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can result in the formation of long-lived magnetar remnants which can enhance neutrino and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In this work, we study the resulting multi-wavelength EM emissions and the prospects of their detectability in the current and upcoming EM telescopes. We model the pulsar-wind neubla system where the long-lived pulsar with dipolar magnetic fields of $10^{13} - 10^{15}$ G (magnetar) spins down and is surrounded by an outward expanding nebula and kilonova ejecta. Although at early times post the merger, the EM signatures are unobservable due to heavy attenuation, they become observable on timescales of $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ days after the merger. We find that the survey and follow-up observations have horizon distances $\gtrsim 1\ \rm Gpc$ for most of the wavebands and conclude that the detection prospects for such long-lived remnants in the electromagnetic channel are promising. This is of crucial importance for multi-messenger observations from BNS mergers to constrain the physical parameters of the remnants. Furthermore, we highlight how observations across the electromagnetic band can uniquely identify magnetar-powered transients resulting from BNS mergers and establish concrete associations of the detected gravitational wave signatures with such transients.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>

Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08367</link>

Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Momentum expansions in finite-density perturbative calculations</title>

Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to unravel proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>
