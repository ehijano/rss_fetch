      <title>Emergence of Internal State-Modulated Swarming in Multi-Agent Patch Foraging System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles are entities that sustain persistent out-of-equilibrium motion by consuming energy. Under certain conditions, they exhibit the tendency to self-organize through coordinated movements, such as swarming via aggregation. While performing non-cooperative foraging tasks, the emergence of such swarming behavior in foragers, exemplifying active particles, has been attributed to the partial observability of the environment, in which the presence of another forager can serve as a proxy signal to indicate the potential presence of a food source or a resource patch. In this paper, we validate this phenomenon by simulating multiple self-propelled foragers as they forage from multiple resource patches in a non-cooperative manner. These foragers operate in a continuous two-dimensional space with stochastic position updates and partial observability. We evolve a shared policy in the form of a continuous-time recurrent neural network that serves as a velocity controller for the foragers. To this end, we use an evolutionary strategy algorithm wherein the different samples of the policy-distribution are evaluated in the same rollout. Then we show that agents are able to learn to adaptively forage in the environment. Next, we show the emergence of swarming in the form of aggregation among the foragers when resource patches are absent. We observe that the strength of this swarming behavior appears to be inversely proportional to the amount of resource stored in the foragers, which supports the risk-sensitive foraging claims. Empirical analysis of the learned controller's hidden states in minimal test runs uncovers their sensitivity to the amount of resource stored in a forager. Clamping these hidden states to represent a lesser amount of resource hastens its learned aggregation behavior.</description>

      <title>Prejudice driven spite: A discontinuous phase transition in ultimatum game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mix of prejudiced and unprejudiced individuals engaged in strategic interactions, the individual intensity of prejudice is expected to have effect on overall level of societal prejudice. High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Time delay embeddings to characterize the timbre of musical instruments using Topological Data Analysis: a study on synthetic and real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition, and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period, allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional persistence statistics.</description>
