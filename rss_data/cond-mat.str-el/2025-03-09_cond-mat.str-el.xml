      <title>Multipolar Fermi Surface Deformations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ Probed by Resistivity and Sound Attenuation: A Window into Electron Viscosity and the Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in electron hydrodynamics have demonstrated the importance of considering the full structure of the electron-electron scattering operator, which encodes a sequence of lifetimes, one for each component of the Fermi surface deformation in a multipolar expansion. In this context, the dipolar lifetime is measured by resistivity, whereas the quadrupolar component probes the viscosity and can be measured in the bulk via sound attenuation. We introduce a framework to extract the collision operator of an arbitrary metal by combining resistivity and sound attenuation measurements with a realistic calculation of the scattering operator that includes multiband and Umklapp effects. The collision operator allows for the prediction of a plethora of properties, including the non-local conductivity, and can be used to predict hydrodynamic behavior for bulk metals. As a first application, we apply this framework to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in a temperature range where electron-electron scattering is dominant. We find quantitative agreement between our model and the temperature dependence of both the resistivity and the sound attenuation, we extract the ratio of the quadrupolar (B1g) to dipolar relaxation rate to be 1.3, and we predict a strongly anisotropic non-local conductivity arising from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions, quantum criticality, and finite-temperature effects in tunable Dirac materials from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ru-doping on the magnetism of Ag3LiIr2O6, a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our investigations on Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6, which results from the Ru substitution in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Ag3LiIr2O6. It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group like its parent compound, Ag3LiIr2O6. Our susceptibility measurements reveal an effective moment = 2.6 muB, which is higher than the moments of the parent compound and less than that of the Ru-analog (Ag3LiRu2O6), suggesting the presence of magnetic Ir4+ (Jeff= 1/2) and Ru4+ (S=1). Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order (LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity. Likewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as expected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast to the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR relaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing temperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However, at low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity and spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the persistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from a fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin relaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other probes. It appears that the main effect of Ru-substitution is to shift the LRO to a higher temperature in comparison with Ag3LiIr2O6, though there are signatures of a novel phase below about 10 K.</description>

      <title>Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6~T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of the transdimensional electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By calculating the critical densities, temperatures and phase diagrams, we show that metallic transdimensional materials are unique in that by simply reducing their thickness one can Wigner crystallize their free electrons at room temperature. When it occurs, the electrons get pinned on a two-dimensional periodic triangular lattice to form an electron super-solid (electron solid inside of a crystalline material). Such a solid melts and gets frozen back with raising and lowering the temperature, respectively, and its resistivity behaves opposite to the free electron gas model predictions.</description>

      <title>Field-induced Multi-$\boldsymbol{\vec{Q}}$ States in a Pyrochlore Heisenberg Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact ground states of the $J_1$-$J_{3b}$ classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. They are non-coplanar multi-$\vec{Q}$ spin configurations with a large magnetic unit cell that generalize the previously found coplanar sublattice pairing states. Using linear spin wave theory, we show that entropy favors these multi-$\vec{Q}$ states at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, and a phase diagram is constructed. We also calculate the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor. Besides the usual Goldstone modes associated with the ordering $\vec{Q}$s, we find high intensity gapless modes at momenta where there are no Bragg peaks.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional flat band in ultra-thin Kagome metal Mn3Sn film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands with small energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands have been experimentally realized in two-dimensional (2D) twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive platform as they natively host flat bands that have been observed experimentally in quasi-2D bulk-crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in atomically thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron-electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here we use angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy and band structure calculations to show that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, we demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering. The realization of tunable kagome-derived flat bands in an ultra-thin kagome metal, represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low-energy electronics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density wave in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry breaking and its interplay among spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding correlated quantum states such as charge density waves (CDWs) and unconventional superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density waves in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4, which exhibits the one-third magnetization plateau. We reveal the emergence of 3Q CDWs incommensurate with the crystalline lattice in both periodicity and orientation, breaking all mirror and rotation symmetries. The CDW exhibits incommensurate-commensurate transitions in an applied magnetic field and transitions between 3Q and 1Q CDWs as a function of field and temperature, accompanied by changes in the spatial symmetries. Remarkably, the quantum and classic melting of the CDWs exhibits a phase structure which is consistent with the magnetization phase diagram of bulk GdTi3Bi4, providing strong evidence for the intertwined charge-spin density wave order. The origin of the charge-spin intertwinement is further evidenced by the observed hybridization between itinerant electrons and Gd local moments. Our findings uncover an unconventional form of charge-spin orders and offer new insights into a broad class of multi-components density wave formation in kagome and other correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Transitions and Mixed Spin in Double Perovskite $Sr_{2}FeMoO_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the double perovskite oxide $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$ are analyzed using a mixed-spin Ising model with spins $\left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{2}\right) $ in the presence of a random crystal field $\Delta$ and exchange interactions $ J $ on a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice. The study employs both the Mean-Field Approximation (MFA) based on the Bogoliubov inequality for Gibbs free energy and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's phase transitions and magnetization behavior, with focusing on the role of Fe and Mo sublattices. We establish the ground-state phase diagram, identifying multiple stable magnetic configurations and first-order transitions at low temperatures. Indicate compensation temperature $T_{comp}$. This work provides deeper insight into the thermodynamic, physics statistic and magnetic properties of $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$, with implications for future applications in spintronics and magnetic storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure, Magnetic and Pairing Tendencies of Alternating Single-layer Bilayer Stacking Nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nickelates have continued to surprise since their unconventional superconductivity was discovered. Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.</description>

      <title>Collapse of density wave and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates realize a rare category of superconductors. However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy - giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions - this approach is extended to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Greens function in the vertex, enabling a fully ab initio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward and clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Spin Density Wave Order in Layered Nickelates $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and $\mathrm{La_2PrNi_2O_7}$ via Neutron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in two- and three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has generated significant interest in these materials as a platform for unconventional superconductivity. While their ground state exhibits magnetism, a direct determination of their magnetic structure remains elusive. Understanding this aspect is crucial, as magnetism may play a role in the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds. We resolve the magnetic structures of the bilayer (2222) polymorphs of La3Ni2O7 and La2PrNi2O7 using neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and muon-spin rotation/relaxation (muSR). Magnetic neutron scattering appears below approximately 150 K in both compounds and is observed at the (qx, 1/2, 0) position, with qx = 0 and 1/2 for La3Ni2O7 and qx = 0 for La2PrNi2O7. Within a single layer, alternating low (0.05 - 0.075 muB) and high (0.66 muB) magnetic moment stripes form. These layers stack antiferromagnetically along the c-direction to form bilayers. The presence of two propagation vectors (qx = 0 and 1/2) in undoped La3Ni2O7 suggests the coexistence of two magnetic stacking polymorphs within a single crystallographic phase. The muSR spectra further confirm these magnetic structures. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the magnetic ground state in bilayer nickelates, offering insights into possible precursor states that may influence the emergence of superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Preparing Tetra-Digit Long-Range Entangled States via Unified Sequential Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to systematically prepare long-range entangled phases has gained momentum with advances in quantum circuit design, particularly through sequential quantum circuits (SQCs) that constrain entanglement growth via locality and depth constraints. This work introduces a \textit{unified} SQC framework to prepare ground states of Tetra-Digit (TD) quantum spin models -- a class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes labeled by a four-digit index $[d_n,d_s,d_l,D]$ -- which encompass Toric Codes across dimensions and the X-cube fracton phase as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of entanglement renormalization group, TD models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. We demonstrate the unified SQC through low-dimension examples first, graphically and algebraically, and then extend to general cases, with a detailed proof for the effectiveness of general SQC given in the appendix. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in quantum simulators, this framework bridges a great variety of gapped long-range entangled states cross dimensions through quantum circuits and shows plentiful mathematical and physical structures in TD models. Through unifying previously disparate preparation strategies, it offers a pathway toward engineered topological phases and fault-tolerant technologies.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the breathing-mode distortions in nickelate-ferroelectric heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transition metal oxides electron-electron interaction and lattice degree of freedom are basic ingredients of emergent phenomena, such as metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and superconductivity. Perovskite rare-earth nickelates are largely studied for their temperature-driven MIT which is accompanied by a breathing mode distortion, and associated to a bond-disproportionation of the expanded (3d8L0) and compressed (3d8L2) NiO6 octahedra. Steric effects control the onset temperature of the MIT, the latter being concomitant or not with a complex antiferromagnetic spin arrangement depending upon the choice of the rare earth ion (TMIT&gt;TNeel). Interface engineering of oxygen octahedra tilting, as imposed by the symmetry and orientation of the substrate, has resulted in an efficient pathway to modify both TMIT and TNeel, hence, suggesting a key role of the electron-phonon coupling for both transport and magnetic properties in nickelate thin films. Here, via a combination of resonant elastic X-ray scattering and transport experiments, we show a control over both TMIT and TNeel in heteroepitaxial PZT(d)/NNO(7 nm)//STO heterostructures, which are characterized by different strains and polarization states of the PZT layer grown at different thicknesses d. We found the expected NNO bulk behaviour, for a fully relaxed PZT layer showing a monodomain polarization state. On the other side, an almost 30 K difference, is found for a fully strained PZT characterized by a multidomain texture of the polarization state. We discuss our results in terms of an altered breathing distortion pattern of the underlying nickelate layer as supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. We infer that locally different polar distortions controlled by a combination of polarization direction and strength of the strain state play the main role in the observed TMIT and TNeel variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic expansion schemes in functional approaches require the inclusion of higher order vertices. These vertices are expanded in independent tensor bases with a rapidly increasing number of basis elements. Amongst the related tasks are the construction of bases and projection operators, the importance ordering of their elements, and the optimisation of such tensor bases, as well as an analysis of their regularity in momentum space. We present progress in all these directions and introduce the Mathematica package TensorBases designed for the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>How pairing mechanism dictates topology in valley-polarized superconductors with Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the pairing mechanism influences topological superconductivity in valley-polarized systems with Berry curvature. We demonstrate that short-range attractive interactions, such as those mediated by phonons, favor superconducting states where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Chern number has the same sign as the Berry curvature. In contrast, overscreened repulsive interactions, as in the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, favor superconducting states where the BdG Chern number has the opposite sign as the Berry curvature. We establish these trends in a fully controlled limit and apply them to a recently reported chiral superconductor in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Our theory provides a concrete experimental criterion for distinguishing between different pairing mechanisms in valley-polarized topological superconductors.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) spin systems, the augmentation of spin fluctuations gives rise to quasi-long-range order; however, how they manifest in spin transport remains unclear. Here we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a quasi-2D antiferromagnet, BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, which has been reported to exhibit the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition owing to its distinct 2D nature. We found that the SSE in Pt / BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ persists well above the N\'eel temperature, significantly different from the behavior of 3D ordered magnets. Our numerical analysis for a 2D microscopic spin model supports the hypothesis that the observed SSE is linked to strong magnetic correlations in the BKT-like phase.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the perturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the QSLs. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in QSLs but also to generate and control them.</description>

      <title>Strong effects of thermally induced low-spin-to-high-spin crossover on transport properties of correlated metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use dynamical mean-field theory to study how electronic transport in multi-orbital metals is influenced by correlated (nominally) empty orbitals that are in proximity to the Fermi level. Specifically, we study 2 + 1 orbital and 3 + 2 orbital (i.e. t2g + eg ) models on a Bethe lattice with a crystal field that is set so that the higher lying orbitals are nearly empty at low temperatures but get a non-negligible occupancy at elevated temperature. The high temperature regime is characterized by thermal activation of carriers leading to higher magnetic response (i.e., thermally induced low-spin to high-spin transition) and substantial influence on resistivity, where one can distinguish two counteracting effects: increased scattering due to formation of high spin and increased scattering phase space on one hand, and additional parallel conduction channel on the other. The former effect is stronger and one may identify cases where resistivity increases by a factor of three at high temperatures even though the occupancy of the unoccupied band remains small (&lt; 10%). We discuss implications of our findings for transport properties of correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the pairing state in a doped band insulator under a periodic driving field. We employ a correlated fermionic model on a honeycomb lattice, in which pairing glue is obtainable via repulsive interactions, and derive an effective model under circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that the effective pairing interaction for doped fermions obtained with the second-order perturbation theory is tunable by the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. We find the optimal frequency range to enhance the pairing interaction and show that the modified effective system can strengthen the two-body bound state. Our study suggests that external driving light can reinforce superconducting pair states in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Towards an ab initio theory of high-temperature superconductors: a study of multilayer cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress towards a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. We take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting properties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an intertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and inhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4\%) required for superconductivity to emerge. We capture material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ to superconduct compared with Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$. We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its \emph{ab initio} settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a nonlinearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate that various features of the dynamical state, such as the Loschmidt echo and time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the dynamical quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition, which is present at equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement in dissipative dynamics can nevertheless distinguish the equilibrium phases from which the system starts evolution.</description>

      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this Letter, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatrick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are anisotropic deformations of the classical 2d XY model labelled by a positive integer $Q$. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of deconfined quantum criticality, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects are easily seen in a classical setting. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase appear, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We discuss experimental systems that realize these transitions and present anomaly-free quantum models that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$ of Chern insulators in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

Abstract: Finding and designing ferromagnets that operate above room temperature is crucial in advancing high-performance spintronic devices. The pioneering van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ has extended the way for spintronic applications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues. However, the physical mechanism of increasing Curie temperature in this material still needs to be explored. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structures and magnetic properties of Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ as a function of temperature using strongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons with both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our study reveals the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands driven by many-body interactions, which enhance magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the hybridization of these flat bands at low temperatures, indicating the possible presence of heavy fermion behavior in this system. Our findings suggest that tunable flat bands near the Fermi level may serve as a key factor in realizing materials with high magnetic transition temperatures and strong magnetic anisotropy. This research provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic devices utilizing vdW flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: first a Krylov operator complexity, and second the Krylov complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytic proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytic expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found in [1] for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>
