      <title>Periodic Homogenization for Switching Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we explore homogenization techniques for a class of switching diffusion processes whose drift and diffusion coefficients, and jump intensities are smooth, spatially periodic functions; we assume full coupling between the continuous and discrete components of the state. Under the assumptions of uniform ellipticity of the diffusion matrices and irreducibility of the matrix of switching intensities, we explore the large-scale long-time behavior of the process under a diffusive scaling. Our main result characterizes the limiting fluctuations of the rescaled continuous component about a constant velocity drift by an effective Brownian motion with explicitly computable covariance matrix. In the process of extending classical periodic homogenization techniques for diffusions to the case of switching diffusions, our main quantitative finding is the computation of an extra contribution to the limiting diffusivity stemming from the switching.</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition IV: Underdamped Langevin and Numerical Discretizations with Partial Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the convergence rate of the underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) is a classical topic, in large part due to the possibility for diffusive-to-ballistic speedups -- as was recently established for the continuous-time dynamics via space-time Poincare inequalities. A central challenge for analyzing ULD is that its degeneracy necessitates the development of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. In this paper, we give a new coupling-based framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical discretizations. First, in the continuous-time setting, we use this framework to establish new parabolic Harnack inequalities for ULD. These are the first Harnack inequalities that decay to zero in contractive settings, thereby reflecting the convergence properties of ULD in addition to just its regularity properties.
  Second, we build upon these Harnack inequalities to develop a local error framework for analyzing discretizations of ULD in KL divergence. This extends our framework in part III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity. Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD establishes (i) the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number), and (ii) the first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total variation error in dimension $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatial decorrelation of the solution to the KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial data. For fixed $t&gt;0$, we determine the decay rate of the spatial covariance function, showing that ${\rm Cov}[h(t,x),h(t,0)]\sim \frac{t}{x}$ as $x\to\infty$. In addition, we prove that the finite-dimensional distributions of the properly rescaled spatial average of the height function converge to those of a Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>A notion of BSDE on the Wasserstein space and its applications to control problems and PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) on the Wasserstein space of probability measures. This formulation extends the classical correspondence between BSDEs, stochastic control, and partial differential equations (PDEs) to the mean--field (McKean--Vlasov) setting, where the dynamics depend on the law of the state process. The standard BSDE framework becomes inadequate in this context, motivating a new definition in terms of measure--dependent solutions.
  Under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate that this formulation is in correspondence with both mean--field control problems and partial differential equations defined on the Wasserstein space. A comparison principle is established to ensure uniqueness, and existence results are obtained for generators that are linear or quadratic in the $z$--variable. This framework provides a probabilistic approach to control and analysis on the space of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tail asymptotics for the length of a busy period in a Generalised Jackson Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Generalised Jackson Network with finitely many servers, a renewal input and $i.i.d.$ service times at each queue. We assume the network to be stable and, in addition, the distribution of the inter-arrival times to have unbounded support. This implies that the length of a typical busy period $B$, which is the time between two successive idle periods, is finite a.s. and has a finite mean.
  We assume that the distributions of the service times with the heaviest tails belong to the class of so-called intermediate regularly varying distributions. We obtain the exact asymptotics for the probability ${\mathbb P} (B&gt;x)$, as $x\to\infty$. For that, we show that the Principle of a Single Big Jump holds: $B$ takes a large value mainly due to a single unusually large service time.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Rates of Convergence for Hermitian Unitary Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides microscopic rates of convergence (ROC) with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for the eigenvalue determinantal point processes (DPPs) from the three major Hermitian unitary ensembles, the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), and the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble (JUE) to their limiting point processes. We prove ROCs for the bulk of the GUE spectrum, the hard edge of the LUE spectrum, and the soft edges of the GUE, LUE, and JUE spectrums. These results are called microscopic because we are able to directly compare the point counts between the converging and limit DPPs, the most refined type of information possible in this situation. We are able to achieve these results by controlling the trace class norm of the integral operators determined by the DPP kernels.</description>

      <title>Lower deviation probabilities for supercritical multi-type Galton--Watson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the lower deviation probability properties for a $d$-type ($d&gt;1$) Galton--Watson (GW) process $\{\textbf{Z}_n=(Z_n^{(i)})_{1\le i\le d};n\ge0\}$ in both Schr\"{o}der and B\"{o}ttcher cases. We establish explicit decay rates for the following probabilities: $$\mathbb{P}(\textbf{Z}_n=\textbf{k}_n),~ \mathbb{P}(|\textbf{Z}_n|\le k_n), ~\mathbb{P}(Z^{(i)}_n=k_n)~~\text{and}~~\mathbb{P}(Z^{(i)}_n\le k_n), 1\le i \le d,$$ respectively, where $\textbf{k}_n\in\mathbb{Z}_+^d$, $|\textbf{k}_n|=\mathrm{o}(c_n)$, $k_n=\mathrm{o}(c_n)$ and $c_n$ characterizes the growth rate of $\textbf{Z}_n$. These results extend the single-type lower deviation theorems of Fleischmann and Wachtel (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Statist.\textbf{43} (2007) 233-255), thereby paving the way for analysis of precise decay rates of large deviations in multi-type GW processes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Risk Processes: A Versatile Framework for Modern Ruin Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the hybrid risk process, constructed via a time-change transformation applied to the solution of a hybrid stochastic differential equation. The framework covers several modern ruin settings, incorporating features like Markov-modulation and reserve-dependent parameters through an interdependent structure where the surplus level influences the dynamics of the background environment. The approach lets us define and analyze the Generalized Omega ruin model, a novel definition of insolvency that synthesizes concepts like Erlangian, cumulative Parisian and Omega ruin into a unified competing-risks framework. Finally, we show that the models are computationally tractable. By adapting recent matrix-analytic techniques, we provide an efficient way to compute a wide range of ruin-related quantities.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Wasserstein distance between Gaussian laws revisited with correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a simple derivation of the formula obtained in Dowson and Landau (1982), Olkin and Pukelsheim (1982) and Givens and Shortt (1984) for the quadratic Wasserstein distance between two Gaussian distributions on $\R^d$ with respective covariance matrices $\Sigma_\mu$ and $\Sigma_\nu$. This derivation relies on the existence of an orthogonal matrix $O$ such that $O^*\Sigma_\mu O$ and $O^*\Sigma_\nu O$ share the same correlation matrix and on the simplicity of optimal couplings in the case with the same correlation matrix and therefore the same copula.</description>

      <title>Non-local random deposition models for earthquakes and energy propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of non-local random deposition models, initially introduced by physicists to study the field of mechanical constraints (stress) applied along a line or on a given area located in a seismic zone. The non-local features are twofold. First, the falling objects have random and heavy-tailed dimensions. Second, the locations where the objects are falling are at least for some of the models that we consider, depending on the shape of the surface before deposition. We consider $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$ a sequence of random $(d+1)$-dimensional surfaces defined on $[0,D]^d$ for $d\in \{1,2\}$. Thus, the process $h_{N}$ is obtained by adding to $h_{N-1}$ an object $$\s\in [0,D]^d \mapsto Z_{N}^{\alpha-1} \psi\Big(\frac{v_{Y_N}(\s)}{Z_N}\Big),$$ where $Z=(Z_i)_{i\in \N}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of Pareto random variables, where $\psi:[0,\infty)\mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ determines the global shape of the object, where $v_{\y}(\x)$ is the distance between $\x$ and $\y$ on the torus and where $Y=(Y_i)_{i\in \N}$ are random variables in $[0,D]^d$ that provide the location of each falling object.
  In the present papers we focus on three variations of this model. First, the rand-model for which $Y$ is an i.i.d. sequence of uniform random variables. Then, the min-model, that introduces an important property of the physics of earthquakes but is also harder to tract since a strong correlation appears between the $N$-th falling object and the shape of the profile $h_{N-1}$. Finally we consider a variant of the rand-model: the stellar model, which allows us to study the intensity of the microwaves emitted by stellar clouds and measured at the Earth surface.
  For those three models, our results identify the limit in law of $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$ viewed as a continuous random functions and rescaled properly. We also determine the limit in law of the fluctuations of $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein projections in the convex order: regularity and characterization in the quadratic Gaussian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show continuity of both Wasserstein projections in the convex order when they are unique. We also check that, in arbitrary dimension $d$, the quadratic Wasserstein projection of a probability measure $\mu$ on the set of probability measures dominated by $\nu$ in the convex order is non-expansive in $\mu$ and H\"older continuous with exponent $1/2$ in $\nu$. When $\mu$ and $\nu$ are Gaussian, we check that this projection is Gaussian and also consider the quadratic Wasserstein projection on the set of probability measures $\nu$ dominating $\mu$ in the convex order. In the case when $d\ge 2$ and $\nu$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure where uniqueness of the latter projection was not known, we check that there is always a unique Gaussian projection and characterize when non Gaussian projections with the same covariance matrix also exist. Still for Gaussian distributions, we characterize the covariance matrices of the two projections. It turns out that there exists an orthogonal transformation of space under which the computations are similar to the easy case when the covariance matrices of $\mu$ and $\nu$ are diagonal.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Mixed p-Spin Spherical Model: Breakdown of Ultrametricity and Failure of the Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the two cornerstones of mean-field spin glass theory -- the Parisi variational formula and the ultrametric organization of pure states -- break down under heavy-tailed disorder. For the mixed spherical $p$-spin model whose couplings have tail exponent $\alpha&lt;2$, we attach to each $p$ an explicit threshold $H_p^{*}$. If any coupling exceeds its threshold, a single dominant monomial governs both the limiting free energy and the entire Gibbs measure; the resulting energy landscape is intrinsically probabilistic, with a sharp failure of ultrametricity for $p\ge4$ and persistence of only a degenerate 1-RSB structure for $p\le3$. When all couplings remain below their thresholds, the free energy is $O(n^{-1})$ and the overlap is near zero, resulting in a trivial Gibbs geometry. For $\alpha&lt;1$ we further obtain exact fluctuations of order $n^{1-p}$. Our proof introduces Non-Intersecting Monomial Reduction (NIMR), an algebraic-combinatorial technique that blends convexity analysis, extremal combinatorics and concentration on the sphere, providing the first rigorous description of both regimes for heavy-tailed spin glasses with $p\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the jump rate in mean field interacting systems of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite systems of $N$ interacting neurons described by non-linear Hawkes processes in a mean field frame. Neurons are described by their membrane potential. They spike randomly, at a rate depending on their potential. In between successive spikes, their membrane potential follows a deterministic flow. We estimate the spiking rate function based on the observation of the system of $N$ neurons over a fixed time interval $[0,t]$. Asymptotic are taken as $N,$ the number of neurons, tends to infinity. We introduce a kernel estimator of Nadaraya-Watson type and discuss its asymptotic properties with help of the deterministic dynamical system describing the mean field limit. We compute the minimax rate of convergence in an $L^2 -$error loss over a range of H\"older classes and obtain the classical rate of convergence $ N^{ - 2\beta/ ( 2 \beta + 1)} , $ where $ \beta $ is the regularity of the unknown spiking rate function.</description>

      <title>Entropic additive energy and entropy inequalities for sums and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a growing number of studies that, over the past 15 years, have established entropy inequalities via ideas and tools from additive combinatorics, in this work we obtain a number of new bounds for the differential entropy of sums, products, and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. Partly motivated by recent work by Goh on the discrete entropic version of the notion of "additive energy", we introduce the additive energy of pairs of continuous random variables and prove various versions of the statement that "the additive energy is large if and only if the entropy of the sum is small", along with a version of the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem for differential entropy. Then, motivated in part by recent work by M\'ath\'e and O'Regan, we establish a series of new differential entropy inequalities for products and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. In particular, we prove a new, general, ring Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa entropy inequality. We briefly return to the case of discrete entropy and provide a characterization of discrete random variables with "large doubling", analogous to Tao's Freiman-type inverse sumset theory for the case of small doubling. Finally, we consider the natural entropic analog of the Erd\"os-Szemer\'edi sum-product phenomenon for integer-valued random variables. We show that, if it does hold, then the range of parameters for which it does would necessarily be significantly more restricted than its anticipated combinatorial counterpart.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment and consumption under forward utilities with relative performance concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a n-player and mean-field portfolio optimization problem under relative performance concerns with non-zero volatility, for wealth and consumption. The consistency assumption defining forward relative performance processes leads to a sufficient characterization of such processes with mean of a Stochastic HJB equations, which highlights the link between wealth and consumption utility, and also characterizes the optimal strategies. In particular, forward relative performance processes with a wealth utility of CRRA type and separable time and space dependence necessarily have a consumption utility of the same form, with the same risk aversion parameter. This characterization gives a better understanding of the drift condition ensuring time consistency. In this setting, we establish closed form of the Nash equilibrium for both the n-player and mean eld problems. We also provide some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Inventory Control Using a L\'evy Process for Evaluating Total Costs under Intermittent Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Products with intermittent demand are characterized by a high risk of sales losses and obsolescence due to the sporadic occurrence of demand events. Generally, both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting approaches are applied to intermittent demand. In particular, probabilistic forecasting, which models demand as a stochastic process, is capable of capturing uncertainty. An example of such modeling is the use of L\'evy processes, which possess independent increments and accommodate discontinuous changes (jumps). However, to the best of our knowledge, in inventory control using L\'evy processes, no studies have investigated how the order quantity and reorder point affect the total cost. One major difficulty has been the mathematical formulation of inventory replenishment triggered at reorder points. To address this challenge, the present study formulates a reorder-point policy by modeling cumulative demand as a drifted Poisson process and introducing a stopping time to represent the timing at which the reorder point is reached. Furthermore, the validity of the proposed method is verified by comparing the total cost with that obtained from a case where an ARIMA model is combined with a reorder-point policy. As a main result, while the total cost under ARIMA-based forecasting increases linearly over time, the L\'evy process-based formulation provides an analytical expression for the total cost, revealing that random demand fluctuations cause the expected total cost to grow at a rate faster than linear.</description>

      <title>Strategic A/B testing via Maximum Probability-driven Two-armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis, greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.</description>

      <title>A Class of Stochastic Runge-Kutta Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations Converging with Order 1 in $L^p$-Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the approximation of solutions for It\^o and Stratonovich stochastic differential equations (SDEs)a new class of efficient stochastic Runge-Kutta (SRK) methods is developed. As the main novelty only two stages are necessary for the proposed SRK methods of order 1 that can be applied to SDEs with non-commutative or with commutative noise. In addition, a variant of the SRK method for SDEs with additive noise is presented. All proposed SRK methods cover also the case of drift-implicit schemes and general order conditions for the coefficients are calculated explicitly. The new class of SRK methods is highly efficient in the sense that it features computational cost depending only linearly on the dimension of the SDE and on the dimension of the driving Wiener process. For all proposed SRK methods strong convergence with order 1 in $L^p$-norm for any $p \geq 2$ is proved. Moreover, sufficient conditions for approximated iterated stochastic integrals are established such that convergence with order 1 in $L^p$-norm is preserved if they are applied for the SRK method. The presented theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We establish concentration inequalities for random dynamical systems (RDSs), assuming that the observables of interest are separately Lipschitz. Under a weak average contraction condition, we obtain deviation bounds for several random quantities, including time-average synchronization, empirical measures, Birkhoff sums, and correlation dimension estimators. We present concrete classes of RDSs to which our main results apply, such as finitely supported diffeomorphisms on the circle and projective systems induced by linear cocycles. In both cases, we obtain concentration inequalities for finite-time Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>Deep neural networks can provably solve Bellman equations for Markov decision processes without the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Subelliptic Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds and Their Convergence to Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the convergence to equilibrium of an $(h,\rho)$-subelliptic random walk on a closed, connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ associated with a subelliptic second-order differential operator $A$ on $M$. In such a random walk, $h$ roughly represents the step size and $\rho$ the speed at which it is carried out. To construct the random walk and prove the convergence result, we employ a technique due to Fefferman and Phong, which reduces the problem to the study of a constant-coefficient operator $\tilde{A}$ that is locally equivalent to our second-order subelliptic operator $A$, in the sense that the diffusion generated by $\tilde{A}$ induces a local diffusion for $A$. By using the compactness of $M$ this local diffusion can be lifted to a global diffusion, and the convergence result is then obtained via the spectral theory of the associated Markov operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of the bounded harmonic functions on a simply connected Riemannian manifold $\widetilde{M}$ without conjugate points, which can be compactified via the ideal boundary $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be a uniform visibility manifold which satisfy the Axiom $2$, or a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a cocompact discrete subgroup of $Iso(\widetilde{M})$, we show that for a given continuous function on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, there exists a harmonic extension to $\widetilde{M}$. And furthermore, when $\widetilde{M}$ is a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, the Brownian motion defines a family of harmonic measures $\nu_{\ast}$ on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, we show that $(\widetilde{M}(\infty),\nu_{\ast})$ is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the compression of reversible Markov chains with rigorous error control. Given a subset of selected states, we construct reduced dynamics that can be lifted to an approximation of the full dynamics, and we prove simple spectral and nuclear norm bounds on the recovery error in terms of a suitably interpreted Nystr\"{o}m approximation error. We introduce two compression schemes: a projective compression based on committor functions and a structure-preserving compression defined in terms of an induced Markov chain over the selected states. The Nystr\"{o}m error appearing in our bounds can be controlled using recent results on column subset selection by nuclear maximization. Numerical experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>On Universality of Non-Separable Approximate Message Passing Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent, and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution. However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP algorithms employing these non-linearities.</description>

Abstract: We employ the recent generalization of the Hardy--Stein identity to extend the previous Littlewood--Paley estimates to general pure-jump Dirichlet forms. The results generalize those for symmetric pure-jump L\'evy processes in Euclidean spaces. We also relax the assumptions for the Dirichlet form necessary for the estimates used in previous works. To overcome the difficulty that It\^o's formula is not applicable, we employ the theory of Revuz correspondence and additive functionals. Meanwhile, we present a few counterexamples demonstrating that some inequalities do not hold in the generality considered in this paper. In particular, we correct errors that appear in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{max-flow min-cut theorem} has been recently used in the theory of random tensor networks in quantum information theory, where it is helpful for computing the behavior of important physical quantities, such as the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of a class of stochastic second-order in time damped evolution equations in Hilbert spaces, subject to the constraint that the solution lie within the unitary sphere. Then, we focus on a specific example, the stochastic damped wave equation in a bounded domain of a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, endowed with the Dirichlet boundary condition, with the added constraint that the $L^2$-norm of the solution is equal to one. We introduce a small mass $\mu&gt;0$ in front of the second-order derivative in time and examine the validity of a Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion approximation. We demonstrate that, in the small mass limit, the solution converges to the solution of a stochastic parabolic equation subject to the same constraint. We further show that an extra noise-induced drift emerges, which in fact does not account for the Stratonovich-to-It\^{o} correction term.</description>

      <title>Symmetric matrices with banded heavy tail noise: local law and eigenvector delocalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider deterministic, symmetric matrices with heavy-tailed noise imposed on entries within a fixed distance $K$ to the diagonal. The most important example is discrete 1d random Schr\"odinger operator defined on $0,1,\cdots,N$ where the potentials imposed on the diagonal have heavy-tailed distributions and in particular may not have a finite variance. We assume the noise is of the form $N^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}\xi$ where $\xi$ are some i.i.d. random potentials. We investigate the local spectral statistics under various assumptions on $\xi$: when it has all moments but the moment explodes as $N$ gets large; when it has finite $\alpha+\delta$-moment for some $\delta&gt;0$; and when it is the $\alpha$-stable law. We prove in the first two cases that a local law for each element of Green function holds at the almost optimal scale with high probability. As a bi-product we derive Wegner estimate, eigenvalue rigidity and eigenvector de-localization in the infinity norm. For the case of $\alpha$-stable potentials imposed on discrete 1d Laplacian, we prove that (i) Green function entries are bounded with probability tending to one, implying eigenvectors are de-localized in the infinity norm; (ii) with positive probability some entries of the Green function do not converge to that of the deterministic matrix; and (iii) the trace of Green function converges to the Stieltjes transform of arcsine law with probability tending to one. These findings are in contrast to properties of Levy matrices recently uncovered. We extend our results to other scaling in front of the noise and derive local laws on the corresponding intermediate scales, and further extend to Wigner matrices perturbed by finite band heavy-tail noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). It consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 6) and the appendices (A to C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. Chapter 5 discusses asymptotic properties of the solution to the stochastic heat equation such as existence of invariant and reversible measures, convergence in law to the invariant distribution, mixing and irreducibility. In Chapter 6, we prove a theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions in the weak sense. Then we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs: the Markov field property, asymptotic bounds on moments of solutions that are useful for studying long-time behavior of the solutions, a comparison theorem for the stochastic heat equation, an introduction to potential theory for SPDEs, and a study of SPDEs with rough initial conditions.
  Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>An upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a (1+1)-dimensional space-time random field conjectured to be the universal limit for models within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We consider the KPZ fixed point with the narrow-wedge initial condition, conditioning on a large value at a specific point. By zooming in the neighborhood of this high point appropriately, we obtain a limiting random field, which we call an upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point. Different from the KPZ fixed point, where the time parameter has to be nonnegative, the upper tail field is defined in the full $2$-dimensional space. Especially, if we zoom out the upper tail field appropriately, it behaves like a Brownian-type field in the negative time regime, and the KPZ fixed point in the positive time regime. One main ingredient of the proof is an upper tail estimate of the joint tail probability functions of the KPZ fixed point near the given point, which generalizes the well known one-point upper tail estimate of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for singular SDEs driven by long-range dependent fractional Brownian motion and other Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion, focusing on the long-range dependent case $H \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. While existing results on regularization by such noise typically require H\"older continuity of the drift, we establish new strong existence and uniqueness results for certain classes of singular drifts, including discontinuous and highly irregular functions. More generally, we treat stochastic differential equations with additive noise given by a broader class of Volterra processes satisfying suitable kernel conditions, which, in addition to fractional Brownian motion, also includes the Riemann-Liouville process as a special case. Our approach relies on probabilistic arguments.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for the two-dimensional random field Ising/FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the total variation (TV) distance between the laws of the 2D Ising/FK-Ising model in a box of side-length $N$ with and without an i.i.d.\ Gaussian external field with variance $\epsilon^2$. Letting the external field strength $\epsilon = \epsilon(N)$ depend on the size of the box, we derive a phase transition for each model depending on the order of $\epsilon(N)$. For the random field Ising model, the critical order for $\epsilon$ is $N^{-1}$. For the random field FK-Ising model, the critical order depends on the temperature regime: for $T&gt;T_c$, $T=T_c$ and $T\in (0, T_c)$ the critical order for $\epsilon$ is, respectively, $N^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, $N^{-\frac{15}{16}}$ and $N^{-1}$. In each case, as $N \to \infty$ the TV distance under consideration converges to $1$ when $\epsilon$ is above the respective critical order and converges to $0$ when below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies when a sequence $(\mu_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ of probability measures on a metric space $(\mathcal X, d)$ admit subsequential weak limits. A sufficient condition called sequential tightness is formulated, which relaxes some assumptions for asymptotic tightness used in the Prokhorov -- Le Cam theorem. In the case where $\mathcal X$ is a compact geodesic metric space, sequential tightness gives means to characterize precompactness of collections of random curves on $\mathcal X$ in terms of an annulus crossing condition, which generalizes the one by Aizenman and Burchard by allowing estimates for annulus crossing probabilities to be non-uniform over the modulus of annuli.</description>

      <title>Extended UCB Policies for Frequentist Multi-armed Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1768</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.1768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a widely studied model in the field of operations research for sequential decision making and reinforcement learning. This paper mainly considers the classical MAB model with the heavy-tailed reward distributions. We introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the pioneering UCB policies proposed by Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [22]. The previous UCB policies require some strict conditions on the reward distributions, which can be hard to guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p&gt;q&gt;1$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(log T)$, thus providing a broadened application area of the UCB policies for the heavy-tailed reward distributions. Furthermore, we achieve a near-optimal regret order without any knowledge of the reward distributions as long as their $p$-th moments exist for some $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation of Structured Covariance Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes optimal convergence rates for estimation of structured covariance operators of Gaussian processes. We study banded operators with kernels that decay rapidly off-the-diagonal and $L^q$-sparse operators with an unordered sparsity pattern. For these classes of operators, we find the minimax optimal rate of estimation in operator norm, identifying the fundamental dimension-free quantities that determine the sample complexity. In addition, we prove that tapering and thresholding estimators attain the optimal rate. The proof of the upper bound for tapering estimators requires novel techniques to circumvent the issue that discretization of a banded operator does not result, in general, in a banded covariance matrix. To derive lower bounds for banded and $L^q$-sparse classes, we introduce a general framework to lift theory from high-dimensional matrix estimation to the operator setting. Our work contributes to the growing literature on operator estimation and learning, building on ideas from high-dimensional statistics while also addressing new challenges that emerge in infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Correction to Doi type models for suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from microscopic $N$ particle systems, we study the derivation of Doi type models for suspensions of non-spherical particles in Stokes flows. While Doi models accurately describe the effective evolution of the spatial particle density to the first order in the particle volume fraction, this accuracy fails regarding the evolution of the particle orientations. We rigorously attribute this failure to the singular interaction of the particles via a $-3$-homogeneous kernel. In the situation that the particles are initially distributed according to a stationary ergodic point process, we identify the limit of this singular interaction term. It consists of two parts. The first corresponds to a classical term in Doi type models. The second new term depends on the (microscopic) $2$-point correlation of the point process. By including this term, we provide a modification of the Doi model that is accurate to first order in the particle volume fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a uniform-in-time estimate for the mean-field convergence of the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) algorithm by rescaling the consensus point in the dynamics with a small parameter $\kappa \in (0,1)$. This uniform-in-time estimate is essential, as CBO convergence relies on a sufficiently large time horizon and is crucial for ensuring stable, reliable long-term convergence, the latter being key to the practical effectiveness of CBO methods.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Testing Thresholds and Spectral Properties of High-Dimensional Random Toroidal Graphs via Edgeworth-Style Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional random geometric graphs (RGGs) of edge-density $p$ with vertices uniformly distributed on the $d$-dimensional torus and edges inserted between sufficiently close vertices with respect to an $L_q$-norm. We focus on distinguishing an RGG from an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graph if both models have edge probability $p$. So far, most results considered either spherical RGGs with $L_2$-distance or toroidal RGGs under $L_\infty$-distance. However, for general $L_q$-distances, many questions remain open, especially if $p$ is allowed to depend on $n$. The main reason for this is that RGGs under $L_q$-distances can not easily be represented as the logical AND of their 1-dimensional counterparts, as for $L_\infty$ geometries. To overcome this, we devise a novel technique for quantifying the dependence between edges based on modified Edgeworth expansions.
  Our technique yields the first tight algorithmic upper bounds for distinguishing toroidal RGGs under general $L_q$ norms from ER-graphs for fixed $p$ and $q$. We achieve this by showing that signed triangles can distinguish the two models when $d\ll n^3p^3$ for the whole regime of $c/n&lt;p&lt;1$. Additionally, our technique yields an improved information-theoretic lower bound for this task, showing that the two distributions converge whenever $d=\tilde{\Omega}(n^3p^2)$, which is just as strong as the currently best known lower bound for spherical RGGs in case of general $p$ from Liu et al. [STOC'22]. Finally, our expansions allow us to tightly characterize the spectral properties of toroidal RGGs both under $L_q$-distances for fixed $1\le q&lt;\infty$, and $L_\infty$-distance. Our results partially resolve a conjecture of Bangachev and Bresler [COLT'24] and prove that the distance metric, rather than the underlying space, is responsible for the observed differences in the behavior of spherical and toroidal RGGs.</description>

      <title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which backward induce some norms on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), I believe that it has not received enough attention. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist). I also develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that values the convergence of posterior credences to the truth, and treats it as a fundamental rather than derived norm. This approach, called convergentist Bayesianism, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor in statistics and machine learning.</description>
