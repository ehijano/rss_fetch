      <title>Dosimetric Study of Lung Modulation and Motion Effects in Carbon ion Therapy for Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-ion radiotherapy provides high dose conformity for lung cancer, but its benefit is limited by two sources of uncertainties: interplay between scanned beam delivery and tumor motion, and dose modulation from heterogeneous lung tissue. This study quantifies the separate and combined dosimetric impact of these effects using the GSI TRiP4D treatment planning system. Eighteen lung cancer 4DCT datasets from TCIA were analyzed. A modulation power ($P_{\mathrm{mod}}$) was assigned to lung voxels. Three values were sampled from a Gaussian distribution ($200\mu\mathrm{m} \pm 67\mu\mathrm{m}$), and an extreme value of $750\mu\mathrm{m}$ was tested. Interplay doses were computed by combining scanned-beam delivery with patient-specific respiratory motion. Four scenarios were studied: static, static with modulation, interplay, and interplay with modulation. Metrics included $D95\%$, $V95\%$, homogeneity index (HI), lung $V16\mathrm{Gy}$, and heart $V20\mathrm{Gy}$. Interplay reduced target coverage by $5.2 \pm 1.5$ pp ($D95\%$), $12.1 \pm 5.9$ pp ($V95\%$), and $8.3 \pm 2.4$ pp (HI). Extreme $P_{\mathrm{mod}}$ alone caused small degradations. When combined with interplay, it partially compensated the loss. This effect decreased with 4D optimization. Fractionation mitigated interplay, leaving lung modulation as the main residual effect.</description>

      <title>Large elements and advanced beamformers for increased field of view in 2-D ultrasound matrix arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound promises various medical applications for abdominal, obstetrics, and cardiovascular imaging. However, ultrasound matrix arrays have extremely high element counts limiting their field of view (FOV). This work seeks to demonstrate an increased field-of-view using a reduced element count array design. The approach is to increase the element size and use advanced beamformers to maintain image quality. The delay and sum (DAS), Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), directional coherence factor (DCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers were compared. K-wave simulations of the 3D point-spread functions (PSF) of NSI, DCF, and MV display reduced side lobes and narrowed main lobes compared to DAS. Experiments were conducted using a multiplexed 1024-element matrix array on a Verasonics 256 system. Elements were electronically coupled to imitate a larger pitch and element size. Then, a virtual large aperture was created by using a positioning system to collect data in sections with the matrix array. High-quality images were obtained using a coupling factor of two, doubling the FOV while maintaining the same element count in the virtual large aperture as the original matrix array. The NSI beamformer demonstrated the best resolution performance in simulations and on the large aperture, maintaining the same resolution as uncoupled DAS for coupling factors up to 4. Our results demonstrate how larger matrix arrays could be constructed with larger elements, with resolution maintained by advanced beamformers.</description>

      <title>OSCAR: An Ovipositor-Inspired Self-Propelling Capsule Robot for Colonoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelling robotic capsules eliminate shaft looping of conventional colonoscopy, reducing patient discomfort. However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.</description>

      <title>Proton Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction Based on the Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. A promising choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop a precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.
  In this work, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm, based on the Richardson-Lucy iteration is proposed for the first time for proton CT image reconstruction. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of CTP528 and CTP404 phantoms were used to benchmark the proposed method. In the case of an idealized detector setup, using a 1 mm pitch grid, 4.88 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.66% average RSP uncertainty was achieved. The present method provides a promising proof-of-concept candidate for compromise between accuracy and speed with several further development directions.</description>
