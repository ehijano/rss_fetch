      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for High-Dimensional Option Pricing within the Uncertain Volatility Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Machine Learning techniques for pricing high-dimensional options within the framework of the Uncertain Volatility Model (UVM). The UVM is a robust framework that accounts for the inherent unpredictability of market volatility by setting upper and lower bounds on volatility and the correlation among underlying assets. By leveraging historical data and extreme values of estimated volatilities and correlations, the model establishes a confidence interval for future volatility and correlations, thus providing a more realistic approach to option pricing. By integrating advanced Machine Learning algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of option pricing under the UVM, especially when the option price depends on a large number of variables, such as in basket or path-dependent options. Our approach evolves backward in time, dynamically selecting at each time step the most expensive volatility and correlation for each market state. Specifically, it identifies the particular values of volatility and correlation that maximize the expected option value at the next time step. This is achieved through the use of Gaussian Process regression, the computation of expectations via a single step of a multidimensional tree and the Sequential Quadratic Programming optimization algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the precision of option pricing and risk management strategies compared with methods already in the literature, particularly in high-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>Temporal Representation Learning for Stock Similarities and Its Applications in Investment Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of rapid globalization and digitalization, accurate identification of similar stocks has become increasingly challenging due to the non-stationary nature of financial markets and the ambiguity in conventional regional and sector classifications. To address these challenges, we examine SimStock, a novel temporal self-supervised learning framework that combines techniques from self-supervised learning (SSL) and temporal domain generalization to learn robust and informative representations of financial time series data. The primary focus of our study is to understand the similarities between stocks from a broader perspective, considering the complex dynamics of the global financial landscape. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets with thousands of stocks and demonstrate the effectiveness of SimStock in finding similar stocks, outperforming existing methods. The practical utility of SimStock is showcased through its application to various investment strategies, such as pairs trading, index tracking, and portfolio optimization, where it leads to superior performance compared to conventional methods. Our findings empirically examine the potential of data-driven approach to enhance investment decision-making and risk management practices by leveraging the power of temporal self-supervised learning in the face of the ever-changing global financial landscape.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Money Supply Strategy Utilizing Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has reshaped the possibilities of reserve banking in the form of the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). Key to the safety of CDPs is the money supply architecture that enables issued debt to maintain its value. In traditional markets, and with respect to the United States Dollar system, interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve in an attempt to influence the effects of excessive inflation. DeFi enables a more transparent approach that typically relies on interest rates or other debt recovery mechanisms being directly informed by asset price. This research investigates contemporary DeFi money supply and debt management strategies and their limitations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a time-weighted approach to interest rate management that implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control system to constantly adapt to market activities and protect the value of issued currency, while addressing observed limitations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trend Following: Deep Learning for Market Trend Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trend following and momentum investing are common strategies employed by asset managers. Even though they can be helpful in the proper situations, they are limited in the sense that they work just by looking at past, as if we were driving with our focus on the rearview mirror. In this paper, we advocate for the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict future market trends. These predictions, when done properly, can improve the performance of asset managers by increasing returns and reducing drawdowns.</description>
