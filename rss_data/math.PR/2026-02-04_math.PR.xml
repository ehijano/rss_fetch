      <title>Crystal Growth on Locally Finite Partially Ordered Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markovian growth process on a partially ordered set $\Lambda$, equivalent to last passage percolation (LPP) with independent (not necessarily identical) exponentially distributed weights on the elements of $\Lambda$. Such a process includes inhomogeneous exponential LPP on the Euclidean lattice $\mathbb{N}_0^d$. We give non-asymptotic bounds on the mean and variance, as well as higher, central, and exponential moments of the passage time $\tau_A$ to grow any set $A \subseteq \Lambda$ in terms of characteristics of $A$. We also give a limit shape theorem when $\Lambda$ is equipped with a monoid structure. Methods involve making use of the backward equation associated to the Markovian evolution and comparison inequalities with respect to the time-reversed generator.</description>

      <title>Moments of sums of exponentials, beyond CHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sharp lower bound on the $L_p$-norm of sums of independent exponential random variables with fixed variance, for $p \geq 2$, thus extending Hunter's positivity theorem (1976) for completely homogeneous polynomials. We determine the exact regime of $p$ where such sums enjoy Schur-monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the leftmost particle in heterogeneous semi-infinite exclusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the leftmost particle in a semi-infinite particle system on $\mathbb{Z}$, where each particle performs a continuous-time nearest-neighbour random walk, with particle-specific jump rates, subject to the exclusion interaction (i.e., no more than one particle per site). We give conditions, in terms of the jump rates on the system, under which the leftmost particle is recurrent or transient, and develop tools to study its rate of escape in the transient case, including by comparison with an $M/G/\infty$ queue. In particular we show examples in which the leftmost particle can be null recurrent, positive recurrent, ballistically transient, or subdiffusively transient. Finally we indicate the role of the initial condition in determining the dynamics, and show, for example, that sub-ballistic transience can occur started from close-packed initial configurations but not from stationary initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise processes with logarithmic response function and their scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider shot-noise processes with an impulse response written in terms of the logarithm of the ratio between current and event time (instead of the usual absolute time difference). We study its finite-time properties as well as its weak convergence, under appropriate scaling and with general assumptions on the dependence of noises on event times. The limiting process coincides with the so-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (introduced in Beghin, Cristofaro, Polito (2026)), which represents a middle ground between standard Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion. It shares the one-dimensional distribution with the former, while possessing the long-memory property (within a certain parameter range) of the latter, though with smaller intensity.</description>

      <title>On the compatibility between the spatial moments and the codomain of a real random field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While any symmetric and positive semidefinite mapping can be the non-centered covariance of a Gaussian random field, it is known that these conditions are no longer sufficient when the random field is valued in a two-point set. The question therefore arises of what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a mapping $\rho: \X \times \X \to \R$ to be the non-centered covariance of a random field with values in a subset ${\cE}$ of $\R$. Such conditions are presented in the general case when ${\cE}$ is a closed subset of the real line, then examined for some specific cases. In particular, if ${\cE}=\R$ or $\Z$, it is shown that the conditions reduce to $\rho$ being symmetric and positive semidefinite. If ${\cE}$ is a closed interval or a two-point set, the necessary and sufficient conditions are more restrictive: the symmetry, positive semidefiniteness, upper and lower boundedness of $\rho$ are no longer enough to guarantee the existence of a random field valued in ${\cE}$ and having $\rho$ as its non-centered covariance. Similar characterizations are obtained for semivariograms and higher-order spatial moments, as well as for multivariate random fields.</description>

      <title>Habit Formation, Labor Supply, and the Dynamics of Retirement and Annuitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decision to annuitize wealth in retirement planning has become increasingly complex due to rising longevity risk and changing retirement patterns, including increased labor force participation at older ages. While an extensive literature studies consumption, labor, and annuitization decisions, these elements are typically examined in isolation. This paper develops a unified stochastic control and optimal stopping framework in which habit formation and endogenous labor supply shape retirement and annuitization decisions under age-dependent mortality. We derive optimal consumption, labor, portfolio, and annuitization policies in a continuous-time lifecycle model. The solution is characterized via dynamic programming and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Our results reveal a rich sequence of retirement dynamics. When wealth is low relative to habit, labor is supplied defensively to protect consumption standards. As wealth increases, agents enter a work-to-retire phase in which labor is supplied at its maximum level to accelerate access to retirement. Human capital acts as a stabilizing asset, justifying a more aggressive pre-retirement investment portfolio, followed by abrupt de-risking upon annuitization. Subjective mortality beliefs are a key determinant in shaping retirement dynamics. Agents with pessimistic longevity beliefs rationally perceive annuities as unattractive, leading them to avoid or delay annuitization. This framework provides a behavior-based explanation for low annuity demand and offers guidance for retirement planning jointly linking labor supply, portfolio choice, and the timing of annuitization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the metric geometry of the set of permutons under the rectangular distance $d_{\square}$. We determine the Chebyshev radius to be 1/4 and characterize all Chebyshev centers: a permuton is a center if and only if it is 1/2- periodic in each coordinate. We also describe permutons that attain the extremal distance 1/4 from a given center.</description>

      <title>Dual Attainment in Multi-Period Multi-Asset Martingale Optimal Transport and Its Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dual attainment for the multimarginal, multi-asset martingale optimal transport (MOT) problem, a fundamental question in the mathematical theory of model-independent pricing and hedging in quantitative finance. Our main result proves the existence of dual optimizers under mild regularity and irreducibility conditions, extending previous duality and attainment results from the classical and two-marginal settings to arbitrary numbers of assets and time periods. This theoretical advance provides a rigorous foundation for robust pricing and hedging of complex, path-dependent financial derivatives. To support our analysis, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the practical solvability of large-scale discrete MOT problems using the state-of-the-art primal-dual linear programming (PDLP) algorithm. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional (or vectorial) MOT instances arising from the robust pricing of worst-of autocallable options, confirming the accuracy and feasibility of our theoretical results. Our work advances the mathematical understanding of MOT and highlights its relevance for robust financial engineering in high-dimensional and model-uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium measures for higher dimensional rotationally symmetric Riesz gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equilibrium measures for Riesz gases in dimension $d$ with pairwise interaction kernel $|x-y|^{-s}$, subject to radially symmetric external fields. We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $\alpha$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$.</description>

      <title>Minimum Number of Monochromatic Subgraphs of a Random Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the number of monochromatic subgraphs of a random graph, when each node of the host graph is assigned one of the two colors. Using a recently discovered contiguity between appearance of strictly balanced subgraphs $F$ in a random graph, and random hypergraphs where copies of $F$ are generated independently, we show that the minimum value converges to a limit, when the expected number of copies of $F$ is linear in the number of nodes $|V|$. Furthermore, using the connections with mean field spin glass models, we obtain an asymptotic expression for this limit as the normalized expected number of copies of $F$ and the size of $F$ diverge to infinity.</description>

      <title>Emergent correlations in the selected link-times along optimal paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of first-passage percolation (FPP), we investigate the statistical properties of the selected link-times (SLTs) -the random link times comprising the optimal paths (or geodesics) connecting two given points. We focus on weakly disordered square lattices, whose geodesics are known to fall under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our analysis reveals universal power-law decays with the end-to-end distance for both the average and standard deviation of the SLTs, along with an intricate pattern of long-range correlations, whose scaling exponents are directly linked to KPZ universality. Crucially, the SLT distributions for diagonal and axial paths exhibit significant differences, which we trace back to the distinct directed and undirected nature, respectively, of the underlying geodesics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SLT distribution violates the conditions of the central limit theorem. Instead, SLT sums follow the Tracy-Widom distribution characteristic of the KPZ class, which we associate with evidence for the emergence of high-order long-range correlations in the ensemble.</description>

      <title>On the maximal perimeter of isotropic log-concave probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the maximal perimeter constant of isotropic log-concave probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. For a measure $\mu$, this quantity, denoted by $\Gamma(\mu)$, is defined as the supremum of the $\mu$-perimeter over all convex bodies and measures the largest possible boundary contribution of convex sets with respect to $\mu$. Let $$\Gamma_n := \sup\{\Gamma(\mu) : \mu \text{ is an isotropic log-concave probability measure on } \mathbb{R}^n\}.$$ We prove that $\Gamma_n \leqslant Cn^{3/2}$, where $C&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. This result improves the previously known $O(n^2)$ upper bound. Under additional structural assumptions, we obtain sharp linear bounds of order $O(n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a characteristic function for laws of random surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,s] \times [0,t] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, in the spirit of expected path developments for one-dimensional stochastic processes into matrix groups. A key property is that path development is structure preserving: path concatenation becomes matrix multiplication. The main challenge is to account for two distinct concatenation operations for surfaces: horizontal and vertical. To address this, we use the notion of surface holonomy from higher geometry to define surface developments, and study this in a stochastic context. We generalize surface developments to the Young setting of $\rho$-H\"older surfaces, where $\rho &gt; \frac12$, show that such developments characterize parametrized surfaces. Our main result shows that the resulting expected surface development provides a computable and structured description of laws of random surfaces and leads to a natural metric on the space of probability measures on surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the Activated Random Walk model on the one-dimensional ring, in the high density regime. We develop a toppling procedure that gradually builds an environment that can be used to show that activity will be sustained for a long time.

      <title>Mean convergence rates for Gaussian-smoothed Wasserstein distances and classical Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish upper bounds for the expected $p$-th power of the Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure $\mu$ and the corresponding empirical measure $\mu_N$, whenever $\mu$ has finite $q$-th moment for some $q&gt;p$. This generalizes recent results that were valid only for $q&gt;2p+2d$. We provide two distinct proofs of such a result. We also investigate the optimality of these bounds by establishing a lower bound of order $N^{-1/2-\varepsilon}$ for a probability measure possessing finite moments of all orders. Finally, we exploit a third upper bound for the Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance to derive new convergence rates for the classical $p$-Wasserstein distance in the critical regime where $\mu$ has finite $p$-th moment but infinite moments of order $q &gt; p$, covering for instance the case of Zygmund classes $L^p(\log L)^\alpha$.</description>

Abstract: We study the scaling limits of genealogical trees arising from Cannings models. Under suitable moment conditions, we show that the rescaled contour and height functions converge to a time change of Brownian motion conditioned on a given local time profile. This conditioned Brownian motion is a self-interacting diffusion constructed independently by Warren--Yor (1998) and Aldous (1998). A key ingredient in our proof is a sequential version of the coming-down-from-infinity property.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for sums of multivariate stretched-exponential random variables: the few-big-jumps principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large deviations for sums of i.i.d.\ random variables with stretched-exponential tails (also called Weibull or semi-exponential tails) have been well understood since the 60's, going back to Nagaev's seminal work. Many extensions in the $1$-dimensional setting have been developed since then, showing that such deviations are typically governed by a single big jump. In higher dimensions, a corresponding theory has remained largely undeveloped. This work provides such a multivariate extension and establishes large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\ random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ under fairly general assumptions. Roughly speaking, for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$, the log-probability of one random vector divided by $x$ exceeding a threshold $t$ in all components behaves asymptotically, for large $x$, as $x^\alpha$ times a negative infimum of a function $\mathcal{J}$. We prove large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\ copies, where the rate function is given by a minimization of at most $k$ summands of $\mathcal{J}$. This establishes a few-big-jumps principle that generalizes the classical $1$-dimensional phenomenon: the deviation is typically realized by \emph{at most} $k$ independent vectors. The results are applied to absolute powers of multivariate Gaussian vectors as well as to various other examples. They also allow us to study random projections of high-dimensional $\ell_p^N$-balls, revealing interesting insights about the appearance of light- and heavy-tailed distributions in high-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Joint distribution of primes in multiple short intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH) and the linear independence conjecture (LI), we show that the weighted count of primes in multiple short intervals follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with weak negative correlations. As an application, we obtain short-interval analogues of many results in the literature on the Shanks--R\'enyi prime number race, including a sharp phase transition: biased races between primes in short intervals emerge once the number of intervals exceeds an explicit critical threshold. Our result is new even for a single moving interval, particularly under a quantitative formulation of the linear independence conjecture (QLI).</description>

      <title>Almost sure bounds for weighted sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that when $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, then $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{3/4+\epsilon}$ for almost all $f$. We also show that there exist arbitrarily large values of $x$ such that $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \gg (\log\log(x))^{-1/2}$. This is different to what is found in the Steinhaus case, this time with the size of the Rademacher Euler product making the multiplicative chaos contribution the dominant one. We also find a sharper upper bound when we restrict to integers with a prime factor greater than $\sqrt{x}$, proving that $\sum_{\substack{n \leqslant x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{1/4+\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>LSD of the Commutator of two data Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma_k^{1/2}Z_k$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma_k$ are $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrices that commute and are independent of the $Z_k$'s for $k=1,2$. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the joint spectral distribution of $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a system of Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = n^{-1}(X_1X_2^* + X_2X_1^*)$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <title>Evolving genealogies in cultural evolution, the descendant process, and the number of cultural traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Moran-type model of cultural evolution, which describes how traits emerge, are transmitted, and get lost in populations. Our analysis focuses on the underlying cultural genealogies; they were first described by Aguilar and Ghirlanda (2015) and are closely related to the ancestral selection graph of population genetics, wherefore we call them ancestral learning graphs. We investigate their dynamical behaviour, that is, we are concerned with evolving genealogies. In particular, we consider the total length of the genealogy of the entire population as a function of the (forward) time where we start looking back. This quantity shows a sawtooth-like dynamics with linear increase interrupted by collapses to near-zero at random times. We relate this to the metastable behaviour of the stochastic logistic model, which describes the evolution of the number of ancestors as well as the number of descendants of a given sample.
  We superpose types to the model by assuming that new inventions appear independently in every individual, and all traits of the cultural parent are transmitted to the learner in any given learning event. The set of traits of an individual then agrees with the set of innovations along its genealogy. The properties of the genealogy thus translate into the properties of the trait set of a sample. In particular, the moments of the number of traits are obtained from the moments of the total length of the genealogy.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse Control with Mean Field Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems with a specific mean-field interaction. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. Each individual agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, which consists of a running reward and income from discrete impulses, where the unit intervention price depends on the market through a stationary supply rate, the specific mean field variable to be considered. In a competitive market setting, we establish the existence of and explicitly characterize an equilibrium strategy within a large class of policies under mild conditions. Additionally, we formulate and solve the mean field control problem, in which agents cooperate with each other, aiming to realize a common maximal long-term average profit. To illustrate the theoretical results, we examine a stochastic logistic growth model and a population growth model in a stochastic environment with impulse control.</description>

      <title>How weak are weak factors? Uniform inference for signal strength in signal plus noise models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper analyzes four classical signal-plus-noise models: the factor model, spiked sample covariance matrices, the sum of a Wigner matrix and a low-rank perturbation, and canonical correlation analysis with low-rank dependencies. The objective is to construct confidence intervals for the signal strength that are uniformly valid across all regimes - strong, weak, and critical signals. We demonstrate that traditional Gaussian approximations fail in the critical regime. Instead, we introduce a universal transitional distribution that enables valid inference across the entire spectrum of signal strengths. The approach is illustrated through applications in macroeconomics and finance.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>Abnormal boundary decay for stable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and $d\ge 2$. Let $\mathcal L^\alpha$ be the generator of a symmetric, but not necessarily isotropic, $\alpha$-stable process $X$ in $\mathbb R^d$ whose L\'evy density is comparable with that of an isotropic $\alpha$-stable process. In this paper, we show that the $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ regularity assumption on an open set $D\subset \mathbb R^d$ is optimal for the standard boundary decay property for nonnegative $\mathcal L^\alpha$-harmonic functions in $D$, and for the standard boundary decay property of the heat kernel $p^D(t,x,y)$ of the part process $X^D$ of $X$ on $D$ by proving the following: (i) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set and $h$ is a nonnegative function which is $\mathcal L^\alpha$-harmonic in $D$ and vanishes near a portion of $\partial D$, then the rate at which $h(x)$ decays to 0 near that portion of $\partial D$ is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (ii) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set, then, as $x\to \partial D$, the rate at which $p^D(t,x,y)$ tends to 0 is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (iii) For any non-Dini modulus of continuity $\ell$, there exist non-$C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open sets $D$, with $\partial D$ locally being the graph of a $C^{1, \ell}$ function, such that the standard boundary decay properties above do not hold for $D$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</description>
