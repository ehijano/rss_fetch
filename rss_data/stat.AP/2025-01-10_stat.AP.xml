      <title>Pressing Intensity: An Intuitive Measure for Pressing in Soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressing is a fundamental defensive strategy in football, characterized by applying pressure on the ball owning team to regain possession. Despite its significance, existing metrics for measuring pressing often lack precision or comprehensive consideration of positional data, player movement and speed. This research introduces an innovative framework for quantifying pressing intensity, leveraging advancements in positional tracking data and components from Spearman's Pitch Control model. Our method integrates player velocities, movement directions, and reaction times to compute the time required for a defender to intercept an attacker or the ball. This time-to-intercept measure is then transformed into probabilistic values using a logistic function, enabling dynamic and intuitive analysis of pressing situations at the individual frame level. the model captures how every player's movement influences pressure on the field, offering actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and decision-makers. By providing a robust and intepretable metric, our approach facilitates the identification of pressing strategies, advanced situational analyses, and the derivation of metrics, advancing the analytical capabilities for modern football.</description>

      <title>Calculating Customer Lifetime Value and Churn using Beta Geometric Negative Binomial and Gamma-Gamma Distribution in a NFT based setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important metric that measures the total value a customer will bring to a business over their lifetime. The Beta Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BGNBD) and Gamma Gamma Distribution are two models that can be used to calculate CLV, taking into account both the frequency and value of customer transactions. This article explains the BGNBD and Gamma Gamma Distribution models, and how they can be used to calculate CLV for NFT (Non-Fungible Token) transaction data in a blockchain setting. By estimating the parameters of these models using historical transaction data, businesses can gain insights into the lifetime value of their customers and make data-driven decisions about marketing and customer retention strategies.</description>

      <title>A Shape-Based Functional Index for Objective Assessment of Pediatric Motor Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical assessments for neuromuscular disorders, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), continue to rely on subjective measures to monitor treatment response and disease progression. We introduce a novel method using wearable sensors to objectively assess motor function during daily activities in 19 patients with DMD, 9 with SMA, and 13 age-matched controls. Pediatric movement data is complex due to confounding factors such as limb length variations in growing children and variability in movement speed. Our approach uses Shape-based Principal Component Analysis to align movement trajectories and identify distinct kinematic patterns, including variations in motion speed and asymmetry. Both DMD and SMA cohorts have individuals with motor function on par with healthy controls. Notably, patients with SMA showed greater activation of the motion asymmetry pattern. We further combined projections on these principal components with partial least squares (PLS) to identify a covariation mode with a canonical correlation of r = 0.78 (95% CI: [0.34, 0.94]) with muscle fat infiltration, the Brooke score (a motor function score), and age-related degenerative changes, proposing a novel motor function index. This data-driven method can be deployed in home settings, enabling better longitudinal tracking of treatment efficacy for children with neuromuscular disorders.</description>

      <title>Guiding Treatment Strategies: The Role of Adjuvant Anti-Her2 Neu Therapy and Skin/Nipple Involvement in Local Recurrence-Free Survival in Breast Cancer Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how causal inference models, specifically the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM), can extract causal relationships between demographic factors, treatments, conditions, and outcomes from observational patient data, enabling insights beyond correlation. Unlike traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which establish causal relationships within narrowly defined populations, our method leverages broader observational data, improving generalizability. Using over 40 features in the Duke MRI Breast Cancer dataset, we found that Adjuvant Anti-Her2 Neu Therapy increased local recurrence-free survival by 169 days, while Skin/Nipple involvement reduced it by 351 days. These findings highlight the therapy's importance for Her2-positive patients and the need for targeted interventions for high-risk cases, informing personalized treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>40 Years of Interdisciplinary Research: Phases, Origins, and Key Turning Points (1981-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the historical evolution of interdisciplinary research (IDR) over a 40-year period, focusing on its dynamic trends, phases, and key turning points. We apply time series analysis to identify critical years for interdisciplinary citations (CYICs) and categorizes IDR into three distinct phases based on these trends: Period I (1981-2002), marked by sporadic and limited interdisciplinary activity; Period II (2003-2016), characterized by the emergence of large-scale IDR led primarily by Medicine, with significant breakthroughs in cloning and medical technology; and Period III (2017-present), where IDR became a widely adopted research paradigm. Our findings indicate that IDR has been predominantly concentrated within the Natural Sciences, with Medicine consistently at the forefront, and highlights increasing contributions from Engineering and Environmental disciplines as a new trend. These insights enhance the understanding of the evolution of IDR, its driving factors, and the shifts in the focus of interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <title>Text Data Analysis of Maternal Narratives: Albanian Women in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in migration studies, research on motherhood among migrant women in Italy remains limited. This study contributes to the literature by examining the family trajectories of Albanian women in Italy, exploring how their migration patterns and experiences have shaped these life aspects. We conducted a comprehensive textual analysis to find the main topics of 30 semi-structured interviews with Albanian mothers living in Milan, Rome, and Bari. After pre-processing the text, we performed an exploratory analysis to identify key features and explore word relationships. The predominant dimensions that emerged relate to family management, work paths and schedules, and strategies and concerns arising from the trade-off between work and childcare. Subsequently, we stratified the sample by entry channel into Italy (study and work, reunification, and irregular channel) and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to model each sub-corpus as a mixture of topics. Our results resonate with existing literature [1] on the key role of female migratory patterns in shaping post-migration fertility. Interviewees who entered Italy through various migratory channels not only differ in their characteristics and migration experiences but also exhibit dissimilar fertility desires and behaviors, motherhood trajectories, and conceptions of their role as mothers and family ideals. These differences influence their priorities and level of commitment to family and work obligations.</description>

      <title>Democratic Resilience and Sociotechnical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions.</description>

      <title>Learning Robot Safety from Sparse Human Feedback using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robot safety can be challenging; user-defined constraints can miss edge cases, policies can become unsafe even when trained from safe data, and safety can be subjective. Thus, we learn about robot safety by showing policy trajectories to a human who flags unsafe behavior. From this binary feedback, we use the statistical method of conformal prediction to identify a region of states, potentially in learned latent space, guaranteed to contain a user-specified fraction of future policy errors. Our method is sample-efficient, as it builds on nearest neighbor classification and avoids withholding data as is common with conformal prediction. By alerting if the robot reaches the suspected unsafe region, we obtain a warning system that mimics the human's safety preferences with guaranteed miss rate. From video labeling, our system can detect when a quadcopter visuomotor policy will fail to steer through a designated gate. We present an approach for policy improvement by avoiding the suspected unsafe region. With it we improve a model predictive controller's safety, as shown in experimental testing with 30 quadcopter flights across 6 navigation tasks. Code and videos are provided.</description>

      <title>Reach Measurement, Optimization and Frequency Capping In Targeted Online Advertising Under k-Anonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth in the use of online advertising to foster brand awareness over recent years is largely attributable to the ubiquity of social media. One pivotal technology contributing to the success of online brand advertising is frequency capping, a mechanism that enables marketers to control the number of times an ad is shown to a specific user. However, the very foundation of this technology is being scrutinized as the industry gravitates towards advertising solutions that prioritize user privacy. This paper delves into the issue of reach measurement and optimization within the context of $k$-anonymity, a privacy-preserving model gaining traction across major online advertising platforms. We outline how to report reach within this new privacy landscape and demonstrate how probabilistic discounting, a probabilistic adaptation of traditional frequency capping, can be employed to optimize campaign performance. Experiments are performed to assess the trade-off between user privacy and the efficacy of online brand advertising. Notably, we discern a significant dip in performance as long as privacy is introduced, yet this comes with a limited additional cost for advertising platforms to offer their users more privacy.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach for Causal Health Equity: A Look at Race Differentials in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new era of large-scale data collection and analysis presents an opportunity for diagnosing and understanding the causes of health inequities. In this study, we describe a framework for systematically analyzing health disparities using causal inference. The framework is illustrated by investigating racial and ethnic disparities in intensive care unit (ICU) outcome between majority and minority groups in Australia (Indigenous vs. Non-Indigenous) and the United States (African-American vs. White). We demonstrate that commonly used statistical measures for quantifying inequity are insufficient, and focus on attributing the observed disparity to the causal mechanisms that generate it. We find that minority patients are younger at admission, have worse chronic health, are more likely to be admitted for urgent and non-elective reasons, and have higher illness severity. At the same time, however, we find a protective direct effect of belonging to a minority group, with minority patients showing improved survival compared to their majority counterparts, with all other variables kept equal. We demonstrate that this protective effect is related to the increased probability of being admitted to ICU, with minority patients having an increased risk of ICU admission. We also find that minority patients, while showing improved survival, are more likely to be readmitted to ICU. Thus, due to worse access to primary health care, minority patients are more likely to end up in ICU for preventable conditions, causing a reduction in the mortality rates and creating an effect that appears to be protective. Since the baseline risk of ICU admission may serve as proxy for lack of access to primary care, we developed the Indigenous Intensive Care Equity (IICE) Radar, a monitoring system for tracking the over-utilization of ICU resources by the Indigenous population of Australia across geographical areas.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping events. For the first time we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events to aid rapid and robust estimation. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Markov-switching State Space Models for Uncovering Musical Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.06244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For concertgoers, musical interpretation is the most important factor in determining whether or not we enjoy a classical performance. Every performance includes mistakes -- intonation issues, a lost note, an unpleasant sound -- but these are all easily forgotten (or unnoticed) when a performer engages her audience, imbuing a piece with novel emotional content beyond the vague instructions inscribed on the printed page. In this research, we use data from the CHARM Mazurka Project -- forty-six professional recordings of Chopin's Mazurka Op. 68 No. 3 by consummate artists -- with the goal of elucidating musically interpretable performance decisions. We focus specifically on each performer's use musical tempo by examining the inter-onset intervals of the note attacks in the recording. To explain these tempo decisions, we develop a switching state space model and estimate it by maximum likelihood combined with prior information gained from music theory and performance practice. We use the estimated parameters to quantitatively describe individual performance decisions and compare recordings. These comparisons suggest methods for informing music instruction, discovering listening preferences, and analyzing performances.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Smoothing of Survey Outcomes using the R Package SUMMER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of complex survey data, and the continued need for estimates of demographic and health indicators at a fine spatial and temporal scale, which leads to issues of data sparsity, has led to the need for spatio-temporal smoothing methods that acknowledge the manner in which the data were collected. The open source R package SUMMER implements a variety of methods for spatial or spatio-temporal smoothing of survey data. The emphasis is on small-area estimation. We focus primarily on indicators in a low and middle-income countries context. Our methods are particularly useful for data from Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. We build upon functions within the survey package, and use INLA for fast Bayesian computation. This paper includes a brief overview of these methods and illustrates the workflow of accessing and processing surveys, estimating subnational child mortality rates, and visualizing results with both simulated data and DHS surveys.</description>

      <title>singleRcapture: An R Package for Single-Source Capture-Recapture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population size estimation is a major challenge in official statistics, social sciences, and natural sciences. The problem can be tackled by applying capture-recapture methods, which vary depending on the number of sources used, particularly on whether a single or multiple sources are involved. This paper focuses on the first group of methods and introduces a novel R package: singleRcapture. The package implements state-of-the-art single-source capture-recapture (SSCR) models (e.g.~zero-truncated one-inflated regression) together with new developments proposed by the authors, and provides a user-friendly application programming interface (API). This self-contained package can be used to produce point estimates and their variance and implements several bootstrap variance estimators or diagnostics to assess quality and conduct sensitivity analysis. It is intended for users interested in estimating the size of populations, particularly those that are difficult to reach or measure, for which information is available only from one source and dual/multiple system estimation is not applicable. Our package serves to bridge a significant gap, as the SSCR methods are either not available at all or are only partially implemented in existing R packages and other open-source software.</description>

Abstract: After an election, should election officials release a copy of each anonymous ballot? Some policymakers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter's name in the public voter file, and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa's current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency tradeoff inherent in all election reporting.</description>

      <title>Quantile balancing inverse probability weighting for non-probability samples</title>

Abstract: The use of non-probability data sources for statistical purposes and for official statistics has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, statistical inference based on non-probability samples is made more difficult by nature of their biasedness and lack of representativity. In this paper we propose quantile balancing inverse probability weighting estimator (QBIPW) for non-probability samples. We apply the idea of Harms and Duchesne (2006) allowing the use of quantile information in the estimation process to reproduce known totals and the distribution of auxiliary variables. We discuss the estimation of the QBIPW probabilities and its variance. Our simulation study has demonstrated that the proposed estimators are robust against model mis-specification and, as a result, help to reduce bias and mean squared error. Finally, we applied the proposed methods to estimate the share of job vacancies aimed at Ukrainian workers in Poland using an integrated set of administrative and survey data about job vacancies.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Country-Level Vaccination Rates and Determinants of Practical Capacity to Administer COVID-19 Vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01447</link>

Abstract: The COVID-19 vaccine development, manufacturing, transportation, and administration proved an extreme logistics operation of global magnitude. Global vaccination levels, however, remain a key concern in preventing the emergence of new strains and minimizing the impact of the pandemic's disruption of daily life. In this paper, country-level vaccination rates are analyzed through a queuing framework to extract service rates that represent the practical capacity of a country to administer vaccines. These rates are further characterized through regression and interpretable machine learning methods with country-level demographic, governmental, and socio-economic variates. Model results show that participation in multi-governmental collaborations such as COVAX may improve the ability to vaccinate. Similarly, improved transportation and accessibility variates such as roads per area for low-income countries and rail lines per area for high-income countries can improve rates. It was also found that for low-income countries specifically, improvements in basic and health infrastructure (as measured through spending on healthcare, number of doctors and hospital beds per 100k, population percent with access to electricity, life expectancy, and vehicles per 1000 people) resulted in higher vaccination rates. Of the high-income countries, those with larger 65-plus populations struggled to vaccinate at high rates, indicating potential accessibility issues for the elderly. This study finds that improving basic and health infrastructure, focusing on accessibility in the last mile, particularly for the elderly, and fostering global partnerships can improve logistical operations of such a scale. Such structural impediments and inequities in global health care must be addressed in preparation for future global public health crises.</description>
