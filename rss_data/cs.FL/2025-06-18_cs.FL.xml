      <title>Controller Synthesis for Parametric Timed Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a (semi)-algorithm to compute winning strategies for parametric timed games. Previous algorithms only synthesized constraints on the clock parameters for which the game is winning. A new definition of (winning) strategies is proposed, and ways to compute them. A transformation of these strategies to (parametric) timed automata allows for building a controller enforcing them. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by an implementation and experiments for the Production Cell case study.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms in the Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.</description>

      <title>Extended Stone Duality via Monoidal Adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08219v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of Stone-type dualities have a long history in algebraic logic and have also been instrumental in proving results in algebraic language theory. We show how to extend abstract categorical dualities via monoidal adjunctions, subsuming various incarnations of classical extended Stone and Priestley duality as special cases, and providing the foundation for two new concrete dualities: First, we investigate residuation algebras, which are lattices with additional residual operators modeling language derivatives algebraically. We show that the subcategory of derivation algebras is dually equivalent to the category of profinite ordered monoids, restricting to a duality between Boolean residuation algebras and profinite monoids. We further refine this duality to capture relational morphisms of profinite ordered monoids, which dualize to natural morphisms of residuation algebras. Second, we apply the categorical extended duality to the discrete setting of sets and complete atomic Boolean algebras to obtain a concrete description for the dual of the category of all small categories.</description>

      <title>A Formalization of Co-Transcriptional Splicing as an Operation on Formal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA co-transcriptionality is the process where RNA sequences are spliced while being transcribed from DNA templates. This process holds potential as a key tool for molecular programming. Co-transcriptional folding has been shown to be programmable for assembling nano-scale RNA structures, and recent advances have proven its Turing universality. While post-transcriptional splicing has been extensively studied, co-transcriptional splicing is gaining attention for its potential to save resources and space in molecular systems. However, its unpredictability has limited its practical applications. In this paper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, moving beyond natural occurrences to program RNA sequences that produce specific target sequences through DNA templates. We introduce contextual lariat deletion operations under three energy models - linear loop penalty, logarithmic loop penalty, and constantly bounded loop length - as well as bracketed contextual deletion, where deletion occurs solely based on context matching, without any structural constraints from hairpin loops. We examine the complexity of the template constructability problem associated with these operations and study the closure properties of the languages they generate, providing insights for RNA template design in molecular programming systems.</description>
