      <title>Galois Energy Games: To Solve All Kinds of Quantitative Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a generic decision procedure for energy games with energy-bounded attacker and reachability objective, moving beyond vector-valued energies and vector-addition updates. All we demand is that energies form well-founded bounded join-semilattices, and that energy updates have an upward-closed domain and can be "undone" through a Galois-connected function. We instantiate these Galois energy games to common energy games, declining energy games, multi-weighted reachability games, coverability on vector addition systems with states and shortest path problems, supported by an Isabelle-formalization and two implementations. For these instantiations, our simple algorithm is polynomial w.r.t. game graph size and exponential w.r.t. dimension.</description>

      <title>Subquadratic Algorithms and Hardness for Attention with Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$). Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d = 2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under $\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Group Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of fixed-point logic ($\mathsf{FP}$) with a group-order operator ($\mathsf{ord}$), that computes the size of a group generated by a definable set of permutations. This operation is a generalization of the rank operator ($\mathsf{rk}$). We show that $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{ord}$ constitutes a new candidate logic for the class of polynomial-time computable queries ($\mathsf{P}$). As was the case for $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{rk}$, the model-checking of $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{ord}$ formulae is polynomial-time computable. Moreover, the query separating $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{rk}$ from $\mathsf{P}$ exhibited by Lichter in his recent breakthrough is definable in $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{ord}$. Precisely, we show that $\mathsf{FP} + \mathsf{ord}$ canonizes structures with Abelian colors, a class of structures which contains Lichter's counter-example. This proof involves expressing a fragment of the group-theoretic approach to graph canonization in the logic $\mathsf{FP}+ \mathsf{ord}$.</description>

      <title>A New Bound on Cofactors of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for polynomials $f, g, h \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ satisfying $f = gh$ and $f(0) \neq 0$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the cofactor $h$ is bounded by $\|h\|_2 \leq \|f\|_1 \cdot\left( \widetilde{O}\left(\|g\|_0^3 \frac{\text{deg }{(f)}^2}{\sqrt{\text{deg }{(g)}}}\right)\right)^{\|g\|_0 - 1}$, where $\|g\|_0$ is the number of nonzero coefficients of $g$ (its sparsity). We also obtain similar results for polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$.
  This result significantly improves upon previously known exponential bounds (in $\text{deg }{(f)}$) for general polynomials. It further implies that, under exact division, the polynomial division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time with respect to the input size and the number of terms in the quotient $h$. This resolves a long-standing open problem concerning the exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  In particular, our result demonstrates a quadratic separation between the runtime (and representation size) of exact and non-exact divisibility by sparse polynomials. Notably, prior to our work, it was not even known whether the representation size of the quotient polynomial could be bounded by a sub-quadratic function of its number of terms, specifically of $\text{deg }{(f)}$.</description>

      <title>Positive Moments Forever: Undecidable and Decidable Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generalized moment membership problem for matrices, a formulation equivalent to Skolem's problem for linear recurrence sequences. We show decidability for orthogonal, unitary, and real eigenvalue matrices, and undecidability for matrices over certain commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. As consequences, we deduce that positivity is decidable for simple unitary linear recurrence sequences and undecidable for linear recurrence sequences over commutative polynomial rings. As a byproduct, we also prove a free version of Polya's theorem.</description>

      <title>How to Construct Random Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>
