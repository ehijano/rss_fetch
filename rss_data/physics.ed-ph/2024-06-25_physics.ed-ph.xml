      <title>Illuminating dark matter I: A guide for physics teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the great mysteries of contemporary science is dark matter, an exotic substance of unknown nature that, in theory, makes up about 27\% of the total mass-energy density of the universe, and which does not appear to emit, absorb, or reflect any kind of light, meaning that it is invisible and can only be detected through its gravitational effects on objects around it. Dark matter is a frontier topic, involving highly complex subjects that usually exceed the training of a physics teacher. Given this difficulty, the aim of this paper is to shed some light on dark matter, and to offer a broad, up-to-date introduction that is mainly directed at physics teachers in training and in practice. Due to the breadth of the subject, the article has been divided into two parts. In Part I, we deal with general concepts, which serve as an introduction to the more specific topics analysed in Part II.</description>

      <title>Escape Room combined with European Board Game Concepts for self-adjusted Challenge Levels: An educational Eurogame Escape Room in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an educational escape room in physics (ERP) covering the main disciplines of physics as taught in the education of neighboring sciences, in this case veterinary medicine, extended by a European board game system of victory points (VP). The puzzles in physics are mandatory to master the ERP requiring to be solved in a sequential order. In our study, we show the growth of knowledge by knowledge-transfer cards separated into disciplines of physics as demonstrated by critical exemplary questions of test groups. Tactical secondary puzzles, the so called \textit{Eurogame puzzles} (EPs), are able to be solved in parallel in any arbitrary and independent sequence, allowing a self-adjusted challenge autolevelled by the students by choice. The motivation is improved by a scoring list to solve, at least, a few optional EPs as additional game-like adventure and challenge collecting VP. A second part of the study demonstrates the attraction of the introduced European board game concept as an important tool for gamificiation and open-by-choice EPs not being necessarily related to physics directly. EPs are able to smooth the contrast of playing games and learning, providing an additional bridge to overcome the fear of physics. A strong advantage is the flexibility of the European board concept, choosing from a broad range of optional EPs to fascinate and motivate students taking into account individual preferences improving escape rooms by decision-making skills. The concept is able be applied to every escape room independent of the taught subject or topic.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a somewhat non-standard view on a set of curious, paradoxical from the standpoint of simple classical physics and everyday experience phenomena. There are the quantisation (discrete set of values) of the observables (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum); forbidden simultaneous measurements of the observables in the most cases (e.g., of a coordinate and momentum, of angular momentum projections on difference axis); counter-intuitive relations on the simultaneously measurable quantities (e.g., the famous expression for the square momentum $l(l+1)$ with the maximal projection $l$). These and other paradoxes are traditionally related to "purely quantum" phenomenon, i.e., having no analogue in the "classical world" ones. However, there are deep analogies between classical and "quantum" worlds, as soon as the quantum technique is applied to the classical phenomenon. We follow these analogies with the examples of relatively simple and well known models of classical physics, such as a simplified model of light transition through the media, a system of electric charges close to each other and far from the observer; the specific of motion in the Coulomb/Newtonian field. This text can be considered as a mini-course addressed to higher school and undergraduate students who are interested in basics of quantum mechanics, but are not yet ready for systematic study of standard courses. The text may be also useful to those who supervise such students.</description>
