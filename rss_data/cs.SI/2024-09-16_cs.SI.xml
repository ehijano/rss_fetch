      <title>Sustainability of Scale-Free Properties in Synchronizations of Dynamic Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-free networks are ubiquitous in social, biological and technological networked systems. Dynamic Scale-free networks and their synchronizations are important to understand and predict the behavior of social, biological and technological networked systems. In this research, computational experiments have been conducted to understand the sustainability of scale-free properties during the time of synchronizations in dynamic scale-free networks. Two synchronization phenomena which are synchronization based on states of nodes with coupling configuration matrix and synchronization based on states of nodes with network centralities have been implemented for the synchronization in dynamic scale-free networks. In experiments, dynamic scale-free networks have been generated with a network generation algorithm and analyzed to understand the fluctuation from the scale-free properties in their phases during the time of synchronizations.</description>

      <title>Resilient Infrastructure Network: Sparse Edge Change Identification via L1-Regularized Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial actions and a rapid climate change are disrupting operations of infrastructure networks (e.g., energy, water, and transportation systems). Unaddressed disruptions lead to system-wide shutdowns, emphasizing the need for quick and robust identification methods. One significant disruption arises from edge changes (addition or deletion) in networks. We present an $\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares framework to identify multiple but sparse edge changes using noisy data. We focus only on networks that obey equilibrium equations, as commonly observed in the above sectors. The presence or lack of edges in these networks is captured by the sparsity pattern of the weighted, symmetric Laplacian matrix, while noisy data are node injections and potentials. Our proposed framework systematically leverages the inherent structure within the Laplacian matrix, effectively avoiding overparameterization. We demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach through a series of representative examples, with a primary emphasis on power networks.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Russian Internet Troll Network on Twitter using a Predictive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Russian Internet Trolls use fake personas to spread disinformation through multiple social media streams. Given the increased frequency of this threat across social media platforms, understanding those operations is paramount in combating their influence. Using Twitter content identified as part of the Russian influence network, we created a predictive model to map the network operations. We classify accounts type based on their authenticity function for a sub-sample of accounts by introducing logical categories and training a predictive model to identify similar behavior patterns across the network. Our model attains 88% prediction accuracy for the test set. Validation is done by comparing the similarities with the 3 million Russian troll tweets dataset. The result indicates a 90.7% similarity between the two datasets. Furthermore, we compare our model predictions on a Russian tweets dataset, and the results state that there is 90.5% correspondence between the predictions and the actual categories. The prediction and validation results suggest that our predictive model can assist with mapping the actors in such networks.</description>

      <title>The Informal Labor of Content Creators: Situating Xiaohongshu's Key Opinion Consumers in Relationships to Marketers, Consumer Brands, and the Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically examines flexible content creation conducted by Key Opinion Consumers (KOCs) on a prominent social media and e-commerce platform in China, Xiaohongshu (RED). Drawing on nine-month ethnographic work conducted online, we find that the production of the KOC role on RED is predicated on the interactions and negotiations among multiple stakeholders -- content creators, marketers, consumer brands (corporations), and the platform. KOCs are instrumental in RED influencer marketing tactics and amplify the mundane and daily life content popular on the platform. They navigate the dynamics in the triangulated relations with other stakeholders in order to secure economic opportunities for producing advertorial content, and yet, the labor involved in producing such content is deliberately obscured to make it appear as spontaneous, ordinary user posts for the sake of marketing campaigns. Meanwhile, the commercial value of their work is often underestimated and overshadowed in corporate paperwork, platform technological mechanisms, and business models, resulting in and reinforcing inadequate recognition and compensation of KOCs. We propose the concept of ``informal labor'' to offer a new lens to understand content creation labor that is indispensable yet unrecognized by the social media industry. We advocate for a contextualized and nuanced examination of how labor is valued and compensated and urge for better protections and working conditions for informal laborers like KOCs.</description>

      <title>Consistent Strong Triadic Closure in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network users are commonly connected to hundreds or even thousands of other users. However, these ties are not all of equal strength; for example, we often are connected to good friends or family members as well as acquaintances. Inferring the tie strengths is an essential task in social network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties into strong and weak edges based on the network topology using the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three nodes, $\textit{A}$, $\textit{B}$, and $\textit{C}$, there are strong ties between $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{B}$, as well as $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{C}$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $\textit{B}$ and $\textit{C}$. Moreover, a variant of the STC called STC+ allows adding new weak edges to obtain improved solutions. Recently, the focus of social network analysis has been shifting from single-layer to multilayer networks due to their ability to represent complex systems with multiple types of interactions or relationships in multiple social network platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X (formerly Twitter). However, straightforwardly applying the STC separately to each layer of multilayer networks usually leads to inconsistent labelings between layers. Avoiding such inconsistencies is essential as they contradict the idea that tie strengths represent underlying, consistent truths about the relationships between users. Therefore, we adapt the definitions of the STC and STC+ for multilayer networks and provide ILP formulations to solve the problems exactly. Solving the ILPs is computationally costly; hence, we additionally provide an efficient 2-approximation for the STC and a 6-approximation for the STC+ minimization variants. The experiments show that, unlike standard approaches, our new highly efficient algorithms lead to consistent strong/weak labelings of the multilayer network edges.</description>

      <title>Toward satisfactory public accessibility: A crowdsourcing approach through online reviews to inclusive urban design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urban populations grow, the need for accessible urban design has become urgent. Traditional survey methods for assessing public perceptions of accessibility are often limited in scope. Crowdsourcing via online reviews offers a valuable alternative to understanding public perceptions, and advancements in large language models can facilitate their use. This study uses Google Maps reviews across the United States and fine-tunes Llama 3 model with the Low-Rank Adaptation technique to analyze public sentiment on accessibility. At the POI level, most categories -- restaurants, retail, hotels, and healthcare -- show negative sentiments. Socio-spatial analysis reveals that areas with higher proportions of white residents and greater socioeconomic status report more positive sentiment, while areas with more elderly, highly-educated residents exhibit more negative sentiment. Interestingly, no clear link is found between the presence of disabilities and public sentiments. Overall, this study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing for identifying accessibility challenges and providing insights for urban planners.</description>

      <title>MAPX: An explainable model-agnostic framework for the detection of false information on social media networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated detection of false information has become a fundamental task in combating the spread of "fake news" on online social media networks (OSMN) as it reduces the need for manual discernment by individuals. In the literature, leveraging various content or context features of OSMN documents have been found useful. However, most of the existing detection models often utilise these features in isolation without regard to the temporal and dynamic changes oft-seen in reality, thus, limiting the robustness of the models. Furthermore, there has been little to no consideration of the impact of the quality of documents' features on the trustworthiness of the final prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework, called MAPX, which allows evidence based aggregation of predictions from existing models in an explainable manner. Indeed, the developed aggregation method is adaptive, dynamic and considers the quality of OSMN document features. Further, we perform extensive experiments on benchmarked fake news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPX using various real-world data quality scenarios. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models evaluated. For reproducibility, a demo of MAPX is available at \href{https://github.com/SCondran/MAPX_framework}{this link}</description>

      <title>Estimation of Graph Features Based on Random Walks Using Neighbors' Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using random walks for sampling has proven advantageous in assessing the characteristics of large and unknown social networks. Several algorithms based on random walks have been introduced in recent years. In the practical application of social network sampling, there is a recurrent reliance on an application programming interface (API) for obtaining adjacent nodes. However, owing to constraints related to query frequency and associated API expenses, it is preferable to minimize API calls during the feature estimation process. In this study, considering the acquisition of neighboring nodes as a cost factor, we introduce a feature estimation algorithm that outperforms existing algorithms in terms of accuracy. Through experiments that simulate sampling on known graphs, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of our proposed algorithm when compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Sybil Detection using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SYBILGAT, a novel approach to Sybil detection in social networks using Graph Attention Networks (GATs). Traditional methods for Sybil detection primarily leverage structural properties of networks; however, they tend to struggle with a large number of attack edges and are often unable to simultaneously utilize both known Sybil and honest nodes. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by dynamically assigning attention weights to different nodes during aggregations, enhancing detection performance. We conducted extensive experiments in various scenarios, including pretraining in sampled subgraphs, synthetic networks, and networks under targeted attacks. The results show that SYBILGAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in scenarios with high attack complexity and when the number of attack edges increases. Our approach shows robust performance across different network models and sizes, even as the detection task becomes more challenging. We successfully applied the model to a real-world Twitter graph with more than 269k nodes and 6.8M edges. The flexibility and generalizability of SYBILGAT make it a promising tool to defend against Sybil attacks in online social networks with only structural information.</description>

      <title>Generating Temporal Contact Graphs Using Random Walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study human mobility networks through timeseries of contacts between individuals. Our proposed Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model generates temporal graph sequences based on independent random walkers that traverse an underlying graph in discrete time steps. Co-location of walkers at a given node and time defines an individual-level contact. RWIG is shown to be a realistic model for temporal human contact graphs, which may place RWIG on a same footing as the Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models for fixed graphs. Moreover, RWIG is analytically feasible: we derive closed form solutions for the probability distribution of contact graphs.</description>

      <title>Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Community-based fact-checking reduces the spread of misleading posts on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community-based fact-checking is a promising approach to verify social media content and correct misleading posts at scale. Yet, causal evidence regarding its effectiveness in reducing the spread of misinformation on social media is missing. Here, we performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze whether community notes reduce the spread of misleading posts on X. Using a Difference-in-Differences design and repost time series data for N=237,677 (community fact-checked) cascades that had been reposted more than 431 million times, we found that exposing users to community notes reduced the spread of misleading posts by, on average, 62.0%. Furthermore, community notes increased the odds that users delete their misleading posts by 103.4%. However, our findings also suggest that community notes might be too slow to intervene in the early (and most viral) stage of the diffusion. Our work offers important implications to enhance the effectiveness of community-based fact-checking approaches on social media.</description>

      <title>Community Fact-Checks Trigger Moral Outrage in Replies to Misleading Posts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displaying community fact-checks is a promising approach to reduce engagement with misinformation on social media. However, how users respond to misleading content emotionally after community fact-checks are displayed on posts is unclear. Here, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally analyze changes in sentiments and (moral) emotions in replies to misleading posts following the display of community fact-checks. Our evaluation is based on a large-scale panel dataset comprising N=2,225,260 replies across 1841 source posts from X's Community Notes platform. We find that informing users about falsehoods through community fact-checks significantly increases negativity (by 7.3%), anger (by 13.2%), disgust (by 4.7%), and moral outrage (by 16.0%) in the corresponding replies. These results indicate that users perceive spreading misinformation as a violation of social norms and that those who spread misinformation should expect negative reactions once their content is debunked. We derive important implications for the design of community-based fact-checking systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling User Engagement Patterns on Stack Exchange Through Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stack Exchange, a question-and-answer(Q&amp;A) platform, has exhibited signs of a declining user engagement. This paper investigates user engagement dynamics across various Stack Exchange communities including Data science, AI, software engineering, project management, and GenAI. We propose a network graph representing users as nodes and their interactions as edges. We explore engagement patterns through key network metrics including Degree Centerality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. The study findings reveal distinct community dynamics across these platforms, with smaller communities demonstrating more concentrated user influence, while larger platforms showcase more distributed engagement. Besides, the results showed insights into user roles, influence, and potential strategies for enhancing engagement. This research contributes to understanding of online community behavior and provides a framework for future studies to improve the Stack Exchange user experience.</description>

      <title>User Identity Linkage on Social Networks: A Review of Modern Techniques and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an Online Social Network (OSN), users can create a unique public persona by crafting a user identity that may encompass profile details, content, and network-related information. As a result, a relevant task of interest is related to the ability to link identities across different OSNs. Linking users across social networks can have multiple implications in several contexts both at the individual level and at the group level. At the individual level, the main interest in linking the same identity across social networks is to enable a better knowledge of each user. At the group level, linking user identities through different OSNs helps in predicting user behaviors, network dynamics, information diffusion, and migration phenomena across social media. The process of tying together user accounts on different OSNs is challenging and has attracted more and more research attention in the last fifteen years. The purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of recent studies (from 2016 to the present) on User Identity Linkage (UIL) methods across online social networks. This review aims to offer guidance for other researchers in the field by outlining the main problem formulations, the different feature extraction strategies, algorithms, machine learning models, datasets, and evaluation metrics proposed by researchers working in this area. The proposed overview takes a pragmatic perspective to highlight the concrete possibilities for accomplishing this task depending on the type of available data.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.
  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.
  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scientific and technological knowledge grows linearly over time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past few centuries have witnessed a dramatic growth in scientific and technological knowledge. However, the nature of that growth - whether exponential or otherwise - remains controversial, perhaps partly due to the lack of quantitative characterizations. We evaluated knowledge as a collective thinking structure, using citation networks as a representation, by examining extensive datasets that include 213 million publications (1800-2020) and 7.6 million patents (1976-2020). We found that knowledge - which we conceptualize as the reduction of uncertainty in a knowledge network - grew linearly over time in naturally formed citation networks that themselves expanded exponentially. Moreover, our results revealed inflection points in the growth of knowledge that often corresponded to important developments within fields, such as major breakthroughs, new paradigms, or the emergence of entirely new areas of study. Around these inflection points, knowledge may grow rapidly or exponentially on a local scale, although the overall growth rate remains linear when viewed globally. Previous studies concluding an exponential growth of knowledge may have focused primarily on these local bursts of rapid growth around key developments, leading to the misconception of a global exponential trend. Our findings help to reconcile the discrepancy between the perceived exponential growth and the actual linear growth of knowledge by highlighting the distinction between local and global growth patterns. Overall, our findings reveal major science development trends for policymaking, showing that producing knowledge is far more challenging than producing papers.</description>

      <title>DELTA: Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty for Active Graph Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from substructures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Is Fact-Checking Politically Neutral? Asymmetries in How U.S. Fact-Checking Organizations Pick Up False Statements Mentioning Political Elites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08821</link>

Abstract: Political elites play an important role in the proliferation of online misinformation. However, an understanding of how fact-checking platforms pick up politicized misinformation for fact-checking is still in its infancy. Here, we conduct an empirical analysis of mentions of U.S. political elites within fact-checked statements. For this purpose, we collect a comprehensive dataset consisting of 35,014 true and false statements that have been fact-checked by two major fact-checking organizations (Snopes, PolitiFact) in the U.S. between 2008 and 2023, i.e., within an observation period of 15 years. Subsequently, we perform content analysis and explanatory regression modeling to analyze how veracity is linked to mentions of U.S. political elites in fact-checked statements. Our analysis yields the following main findings: (i) Fact-checked false statements are, on average, 20% more likely to mention political elites than true fact-checked statements. (ii) There is a partisan asymmetry such that fact-checked false statements are 88.1% more likely to mention Democrats, but 26.5% less likely to mention Republicans, compared to fact-checked true statements. (iii) Mentions of political elites in fact-checked false statements reach the highest level during the months preceding elections. (iv) Fact-checked false statements that mention political elites carry stronger other-condemning emotions and are more likely to be pro-Republican, compared to fact-checked true statements. In sum, our study offers new insights into understanding mentions of political elites in false statements on U.S. fact-checking platforms, and bridges important findings at the intersection between misinformation and politicization.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Attacks for Black-box Social Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on argeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework MultiAttack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.</description>

      <title>A recommender network perspective on the informational value of critics and crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do the ratings of critics and amateurs compare and how should they be combined? Previous research has produced mixed results about the first question, while the second remains unanswered. We have created a new, unique dataset, with wine ratings from critics and amateurs, and simulated a recommender system using the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. We then formalized the advice seeking network spanned by that algorithm and studied people's relative influence. We find that critics are more consistent than amateurs, and thus their advice is more predictive than advice from amateurs. Getting advice from both groups can further boost performance. Our network theoretic approach allows us to identify influential critics, talented amateurs, and the information flow between groups. Our results provide evidence about the informational function of critics, while our framework is broadly applicable and can be leveraged to devise good decision strategies and more transparent recommender systems.</description>

      <title>ComGPT: Detecting Local Community Structure with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT, have demonstrated the ability to understand graph structures and have achieved excellent performance in various graph reasoning tasks, such as node classification. Despite their strong abilities in graph reasoning tasks, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of community-related graph information, which hinders their capabilities in the community detection task. Moreover, local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion, referred to as seed expansion algorithms, often face the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. To use LLMs to overcome the above shortcomings, we explore a GPT-guided seed expansion algorithm named ComGPT. ComGPT iteratively selects potential nodes by local modularity M from the detected community's neighbors, and subsequently employs LLMs to choose the node to join the detected community from these selected potential nodes. To address the above issues faced by LLMs, we improve graph encoding method, called Incident, by incorporating community knowledge to improve LLMs's understanding of community-related graph information. Additionally, we design the NSG (Node Selection Guide) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that ComGPT outperforms the comparison methods, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the improved graph encoding method and prompts.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Graph Transformers Across Diverse Graphs and Tasks via Pre-Training on Industrial-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.</description>
