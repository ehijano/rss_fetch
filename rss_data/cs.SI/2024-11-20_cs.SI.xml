      <title>Measuring social consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many organizations describe their processes as consensus-driven, but there is no consensus on the definition of consensus. Qualitative definitions of consensus prioritize social phenomena like "unity" that are not necessarily measurable. Quantitative definitions of consensus derive from numbers of votes and can be realized in software. When unity and cooperation become unobtainable for any reason, measuring consensus as a quantity (an amount of agreement) is a reasonable adaptation to alleviate gridlock and possibly avoid escalation of conflicts. This article investigates the metrology of social consensus.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of relationship-driven cooperation under recommendation protocol on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional game models often simplify interactions among agents as static, real-world social relationships are inherently dynamic, influenced by both immediate payoffs and alternative information. Motivated by this fact, we introduce a coevolutionary multiplex network model that incorporates the concepts of a relationship threshold and a recommendation mechanism to explore how the strength of relationships among agents interacts with their strategy choices within the framework of weak prisoner's dilemma games. In the relationship layer, the relationship strength between agents varies based on interaction outcomes. In return, the strategy choice of agents in the game layer is influenced by both payoffs and relationship indices, and agents can interact with distant agents through a recommendation mechanism. Simulation of various network topologies reveals that a higher average degree supports cooperation, although increased randomness in interactions may inhibit its formation. Interestingly, a higher threshold value of interaction quality is detrimental, while the applied recommendation protocol can improve global cooperation. The best results are obtained when the relative weight of payoff is minimal and the individual fitness is dominated by the relationship indices gained from the quality of links to neighbors. As a consequence, the changes in the distribution of relationship indices are closely correlated with overall levels of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Learning To Sample the Meta-Paths for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media data is inherently rich, as it includes not only text content, but also users, geolocation, entities, temporal information, and their relationships. This data richness can be effectively modeled using heterogeneous information networks (HINs) as it can handle multiple types of nodes and relationships, allowing for a comprehensive representation of complex interactions within social data. Meta-path-based methods use the sequences of relationships between different types of nodes in an HIN to capture the diverse and rich relationships within the social networks. However, the performance of social event detection methods is highly sensitive to the selection of meta-paths and existing meta-path based detectors either rely on human efforts or struggle to determining the effective meta-path set for model training and evaluation. In order to automatically discover the most important meta-paths, we propose a simple, yet effective, end-to-end Learning To Sample (LTS) framework for meta-path searching. Specifically, we build graphs that contain not only user profiles, textual content, and details about entities, but also the intricate relationships among them. The prioritized meta-paths, based on their importance, are sampled from the maintained distribution and their features are constructed before feeding into the social event detector. After picking up the top-ranked meta-paths, we streamline the exponential increment of meta-path combinations into a finite set of highly influential ones. The chosen meta-paths, along with their respective weights, are then used to train our social event detection model. As an alternative to social event detector training, we further propose an extra non-parametric evaluation process in order to determine the importance of each meta-path, which can further guide the paths sampling during model training.</description>

      <title>Identifying Core-Periphery Structures in Networks via Artificial Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core periphery structure represents a meso-scale structure in networks, characterized by a dense interconnection of core nodes and sparse connections among peripheral nodes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for detecting core periphery structure, leveraging Artificial Ants. Core-periphery structures play a crucial role in elucidating network organization across various domains. The proposed approach, inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, employs artificial pheromone trails to iteratively construct and refine solutions, thereby eliminating the need for arbitrary partitions that often constrain traditional methods. Our method is applied to a diverse selection of real world networks including historical, literary, linguistic, sports, and animal social networks highlighting its adaptability and robustness. We systematically compare the performance of our approach against established core-periphery detection techniques, emphasizing differences in node classification between the core and periphery. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior flexibility and precision, offering marked improvements in the accuracy of core periphery structure detection.</description>

      <title>Two models of sparse and clustered dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two models of sparse dynamic networks that display transitivity - the tendency for vertices sharing a common neighbour to be neighbours of one another. Our first network is a continuous time Markov chain $G=\{G_t=(V,E_t), t\ge 0\}$ whose states are graphs with the common vertex set $V=\{1,\dots, n\}$. The transitions are defined as follows. Given $t$, the vertex pairs $\{i,j\}\subset V$ are assigned independent exponential waiting times $A_{ij}$. At time $t+\min_{ij} A_{ij}$ the pair $\{i_0,j_0\}$ with $A_{i_0j_0}=\min_{ij} A_{ij}$ toggles its adjacency status. To mimic clustering patterns of sparse real networks we set intensities $a_{ij}$ of exponential times $A_{ij}$ to be negatively correlated with the degrees of the common neighbours of vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G_t$. Another dynamic network is based on a latent Markov chain $H=\{H_t=(V\cup W, E_t), t\ge 0\}$ whose states are bipartite graphs with the bipartition $V\cup W$, where $W=\{1,\dots,m\}$ is an auxiliary set of attributes/affiliations. Our second network $G'=\{G'_t =(E'_t,V), t\ge 0\}$ is the affiliation network defined by $H$: vertices $i_1,i_2\in V$ are adjacent in $G'_t$ whenever $i_1$ and $i_2$ have a common neighbour in $H_t$. We analyze geometric properties of both dynamic networks at stationarity and show that networks possess high clustering. They admit tunable degree distribution and clustering coefficients.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Preference Enhanced Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item according to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item interactions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic heterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender system. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model heterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and modelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other hand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in interaction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced Transformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level graph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph convolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency representation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical cross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a novel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user preference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential pattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference . Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Innovativeness of Celebrated Scientists and Their Embeddedness in Collaboration Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matthew effects, or the tendency for early achievements in science to lead to more recognition and opportunities, are a potential source of stratification and lost innovation when they draw unreasonable attention away from equally innovative but less celebrated scholars. Here, we analyze whether prizewinners produce more innovative works before and after being awarded a prize compared to equivalently impactful non-prizewinning contenders. Our data covers the careers of prizewinners and their dynamically matched non-prizewinners, a longitudinal, science-wide sample of 23,562 scholars and 5.7 million publications. We measured the innovativeness of prizewinners' and non-prizewinners' publications in terms of their novelty, convergent thinking, and interdisciplinarity. We find that prizewinners display distinctive forms of innovativeness relative to their non-prizewinning counterparts in terms of combining ideas in novel ways, bridging foundational and cutting-edge work on a topic, and formulating approaches to problems that leverage the strengths of interdisciplinarity. Further, prizewinners' innovativeness is strongly predicted by their type of network embeddedness. In contrast to matched non-prizewinners, prizewinners have shorter-term collaborations, their collaborators tend to focus their attention on topics that are new to the prizewinners, and their collaborators' collaborators have minimal overlap.</description>

      <title>Cities beyond proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of `proximity-based cities' has gained attention as a new urban organizational model. Most prominently, the 15-minute city contends that cities can function more effectively, equitably and sustainably if essential, everyday services and key amenities are within a 15-minute walk or cycle. However, focusing solely on travel time risks overlooking disparities in service quality, as the proximity paradigm tends to emphasize the mere presence of an element in a location rather than bringing up more complex questions of identity, diversity, quality, value or relationships. Transitioning to value-based cities by considering more than just proximity can enhance local identity, resilience and urban democracy. Fostering bottom-up initiatives can create a culture of local care and value, while predominantly top-down governing strategies can lead to large inequalities. Balancing these approaches can maximize resilience, health and sustainability. This equilibrium has the potential to accompany sustainable growth, by encouraging the creation of innovative urban solutions and reducing inequalities.</description>

      <title>An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</description>

      <title>Variational Graph Autoencoder for Heterogeneous Information Networks with Missing and Inaccurate Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges, have recently demonstrated excellent performance in graph mining. However, most existing heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) ignore the problems of missing attributes, inaccurate attributes and scarce labels for nodes, which limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a generative self-supervised model GraMI to address these issues simultaneously. Specifically, GraMI first initializes all the nodes in the graph with a low-dimensional representation matrix. After that, based on the variational graph autoencoder framework, GraMI learns both node-level and attribute-level embeddings in the encoder, which can provide fine-grained semantic information to construct node attributes. In the decoder, GraMI reconstructs both links and attributes. Instead of directly reconstructing raw features for attributed nodes, GraMI generates the initial low-dimensional representation matrix for all the nodes, based on which raw features of attributed nodes are further reconstructed to leverage accurate attributes. In this way, GraMI can not only complete informative features for non-attributed nodes, but rectify inaccurate ones for attributed nodes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of GraMI in tackling HINs with missing and inaccurate attributes.</description>

      <title>GraphSnapShot: Graph Machine Learning Acceleration with Fast Storage and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.
  The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at https://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize dealership network planning for a luxury car manufacturer in the U.S. By conducting a comprehensive literature review on dealership location determinants, the study identifies 65 county-level explanatory variables, augmented by two additional measures of regional interconnectedness derived from social and mobility data. An ablation study involving 34 variable combinations and ten state-of-the-art GNN operators reveals key insights into the predictive power of various variables, particularly highlighting the significance of competition, demographic factors, and mobility patterns in influencing dealership location decisions. The analysis pinpoints seven specific counties as promising targets for network expansion. This research not only illustrates the effectiveness of GNNs in solving complex geospatial decision-making problems but also provides actionable recommendations and valuable methodological insights for industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Synergizing LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph for Socioeconomic Prediction in LBSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast development of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has led to significant changes in society, resulting in popular studies of using LBSN data for socioeconomic prediction, e.g., regional population and commercial activity estimation. Existing studies design various graphs to model heterogeneous LBSN data, and further apply graph representation learning methods for socioeconomic prediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on heuristic ideas and expertise to extract task-relevant knowledge from diverse data, which may not be optimal for specific tasks. Additionally, they tend to overlook the inherent relationships between different indicators, limiting the prediction accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning, embedding, and multi-agent collaboration, in this work, we synergize LLM agents and knowledge graph for socioeconomic prediction. We first construct a location-based knowledge graph (LBKG) to integrate multi-sourced LBSN data. Then we leverage the reasoning power of LLM agent to identify relevant meta-paths in the LBKG for each type of socioeconomic prediction task, and design a semantic-guided attention module for knowledge fusion with meta-paths. Moreover, we introduce a cross-task communication mechanism to further enhance performance by enabling knowledge sharing across tasks at both LLM agent and KG levels. On the one hand, the LLM agents for different tasks collaborate to generate more diverse and comprehensive meta-paths. On the other hand, the embeddings from different tasks are adaptively merged for better socioeconomic prediction. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the synergistic design between LLM and KG, providing insights for information sharing across socioeconomic prediction tasks.</description>
