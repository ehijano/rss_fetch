      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>The ${\phi NN,J/\psi NN,\eta_c NN}$ systems based on HAL QCD interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of bound states and resonances in the ${\phi NN, J/\psi NN, \eta_c NN}$ systems using HAL QCD interactions for ${\phi N, J/\psi N}$, and ${\eta_c N}$. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"odinger equation and find no resonances or bound states in the ${J/\psi NN}$ and ${\eta_c NN}$ systems. We estimate the interaction between charmonium and nuclei, concluding that the $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ is likely to bind with ${}^3\mathrm{H}$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}$, ${}^4\mathrm{He}$, and heavier nuclei. For the $\phi NN$ system, the lattice QCD $\phi N\left({ }^2 S_{1 / 2}\right)$ interaction is absent. We combine the $\phi p$ correlation function analysis and HAL QCD results in Model A. We assume the spin-spin interactions for $J/\psi N$ and $\phi N$ systems are inversely proportional to their masses in Model B. Model A predicts a stronger $\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties. In contrast, these states are very loosely bound in Model B, with binding energies below 1 MeV and an existent probability of about 60\% when parameter uncertainties are considered. In both models, there exist very loosely bound $I(J^P) = 0(2^-)$ three-body states which resemble a $\phi$-d atom with the $\phi$ meson surrounding the deuteron, but their existences are sensitive to parameter uncertainties. No bound states or resonances are found in the isovector $I(J^P) = 1(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ system.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Gluonic structure from instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instanton vacuum provides an effective description of chiral symmetry breaking by local topological fluctuations of the gauge fields, as observed in lattice QCD simulations. The resulting effective dynamics at momenta below $1/\bar\rho \approx$ 0.6 GeV explains the basic features of light-quark correlation functions and is used extensively in studies of hadron structure. The instanton fields also make definite contributions to the gluonic structure of light hadrons, as expressed in the matrix elements of composite quark-gluon or gluon operators. The article reviews the gluonic structure of light hadrons (nucleon, pion) induced by instantons. This includes: (i) twist-2 parton distributions and momentum sum rule; (ii) twist-3 angular momentum and spin-orbit interactions; (iii) twist-3 and 4 quark-gluon correlations and power corrections; (iv) trace anomaly and hadron mass decomposition; (v) scalar gluon form factors and mechanical properties; (vi) axial anomaly and pseudoscalar gluon form factors. It also discusses possible further applications of the methods and recent developments including gauge field configurations beyond instantons.</description>

      <title>A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decays $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow \Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decays of $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow\Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in all lepton channels. To do this, we first obtain the form factors defining these decay modes within the framework of QCD sum rules. Then, using the transferred momentum squared-dependent form factors, we compute the decay widths and branching fractions for all lepton channels and compare the results of our calculations with those obtained from other theoretical methods. We also estimate the branching ratios and the ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels to provide useful information for future experiments may be planned at different Colliders. Such comparison will provide valuable information about the consistency/inconsistency of the SM theory predictions with experimental data in weak semileptonic single heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Gluon gravitational form factors of the proton in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton using a light-front spectator model based on soft-wall AdS/QCD, where the active parton is a gluon. The model parameters are determined by fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution function to the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Subsequently, we predict the polarized gluon distribution, finding consistency with global analyses. Our predictions for the gluon GFFs show good agreement with recent lattice QCD simulations and experimental extractions. Using these gluon GFFs, we compute the contribution of the gluon to the proton mass and mechanical radii. We also analyze the gluonic contribution to the two-dimensional Galilean densities, including energy density, radial and tangential pressure, isotropic pressure, and pressure anisotropy of the proton.</description>

      <title>Entropic bottlenecks to nematic ordering in an $RP^{2}$ apolar spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Quarkonia Spectral Functions in the Pseudoscalar Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quarkonia, the bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, are important tools for studying the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this study, we examine the behavior of in-medium quarkonium bound states in the QGP by analyzing their spectral functions at two temperatures, $T = 220\,\textrm{MeV}$ and $T = 293\,\textrm{MeV}$. We use physics-motivated information to reconstruct the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator. Near the threshold, the spectral function is estimated through a complex potential, determined non-perturbatively from Wilson line correlators. Our results show that the real part of the potential undergoes color screening above $T_{pc}$, while the imaginary part grows rapidly with increasing distance and temperature. For the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectral function, we use the perturbative vacuum spectral function, as the temperature effects are suppressed in this region. In the absence of a transport peak in the pseudoscalar channel, we find that this combination effectively describes the pseudoscalar correlator on the lattice, calculated using relativistic quark fields. Our results show that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) experiences significant thermal effects, as indicated by the broadening of the $\eta_c(1S)$ state. In contrast, the $\eta_b(1S)$ state remains intact, with a sharp bound state peak.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. The decays to $DD$ and $BB$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilations of $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $ m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(140 \pm 13)~ \mathrm{MeV }$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics of Black Holes in Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities using the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel and higher resolution using renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.</description>
