      <title>N-Way Joint Mutual Exclusion Does Not Imply Any Pairwise Mutual Exclusion for Propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of N propositions, if any pair is mutual exclusive, then the set of all propositions are N-way jointly mutually exclusive. This paper provides a new general counterexample to the converse. We prove that for any set of N propositional variables, there exist N propositions such that their N-way conjunction is zero, yet all k-way component conjunctions are non-zero. The consequence is that N-way joint mutual exclusion does not imply any pairwise mutual exclusion. A similar result is true for sets since propositional calculus and set theory are models for two-element Boolean algebra.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Greedy and randomized heuristics for optimization of k-domination models in digraphs and road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs provide more subtle and precise modelling tools for optimization in road networks than simple graphs. In particular, they are more suitable in the context of alternative fuel vehicles and new automotive technologies, like electric vehicles. In this paper, we introduce the new general concept of a reachability digraph associated with a road network to model the placement of refuelling facilities in road networks as k-dominating sets in the reachability digraph. Two new greedy heuristics are designed and experimentally tested to search for small k-dominating sets in two types of digraphs, including the reachability digraphs. Refined greedy strategies are shown to be efficient, capable of finding good quality solutions, and suitable for application in very large digraphs and road networks. Also, a probabilistic method is used to prove a new upper bound on the k-domination number of a digraph, which informs the development of a new randomized heuristic to search for k-dominating sets in the digraph. Generalizing the randomized heuristic ideas, making the heuristic more flexible, tuning and combining it with the greedy strategies allows us to obtain even better results for the reachability digraphs. Computational experiments are conducted for a case study of road networks in the West Midlands (UK).</description>

      <title>Random local access for sampling k-SAT solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sublinear time algorithm that gives random local access to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to an arbitrary k-CNF formula $\Phi$, at exponential clause density. Our algorithm provides memory-less query access to variable assignments, such that the output variable assignments consistently emulate a single global satisfying assignment whose law is close to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to $\Phi$.
  Such models were formally defined (for the more general task of locally sampling from exponentially sized sample spaces) in 2017 by Biswas, Rubinfeld, and Yodpinyanee, who studied the analogous problem for the uniform distribution over proper q-colorings. This model extends a long line of work over multiple decades that studies sublinear time algorithms for problems in theoretical computer science. Random local access and related models have been studied for a wide variety of natural Gibbs distributions and random graphical processes. Here, we establish feasiblity of random local access models for one of the most canonical such sample spaces, the set of satisfying assignments to a k-CNF formula.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Inferring Chemical Compounds with the Desired Aqueous Solubility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous solubility (AS) is a key physiochemical property that plays a crucial role in drug discovery and material design. We report a novel unified approach to predict and infer chemical compounds with the desired AS based on simple deterministic graph-theoretic descriptors, multiple linear regression (MLR) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Selected descriptors based on a forward stepwise procedure enabled the simplest regression model, MLR, to achieve significantly good prediction accuracy compared to the existing approaches, achieving the accuracy in the range [0.7191, 0.9377] for 29 diverse datasets. By simulating these descriptors and learning models as MILPs, we inferred mathematically exact and optimal compounds with the desired AS, prescribed structures, and up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms in a reasonable time range [6, 1204] seconds. These findings indicate a strong correlation between the simple graph-theoretic descriptors and the AS of compounds, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of their AS without relying on widely used complicated chemical descriptors and complex machine learning models that are computationally expensive, and therefore difficult to use for inference. An implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/ku-dml/mol-infer/tree/master/AqSol.</description>

      <title>An algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating connected induced subgraphs of size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating connected subgraphs of a given size in a graph has been extensively studied in recent years. In this short communication, we propose an algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of size $k$ in an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $k$ and $\Delta$ are respectively the size of subgraphs and the maximum degree of $G$. The proposed algorithm improves upon the current best delay bound $\mathcal{O}(k^2\Delta)$ for the connected induced subgraph enumeration problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $d$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance at least $d$. A $d$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,d)$ and $K(n,d)$ be the maximum size of a $d$-Cayley and a $d$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2d}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^d}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>
