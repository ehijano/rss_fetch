      <title>Jones-Wenzl projectors and odd Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jones-Wenzl projectors are particular elements of the Temperley-Lieb algebra essential to the construction of quantum 3-manifold invariants. As a first step toward categorifying quantum 3-manifold invariants, Cooper and Krushkal categorified these projectors. In another direction, Naisse and Putyra gave a categorification of the Temperley-Lieb algebra compatible with odd Khovanov homology, introducing new machinery called grading categories. We provide a generalization of Naisse and Putyra's work in the spirit of Bar-Natan's canopolies or Jones's planar algebras, replacing grading categories with grading multicategories. We use our setup to prove the existence and uniqueness of categorified Jones-Wenzl projectors in odd Khovanov homology. This result quickly implies the existence of a new, "odd" categorification of the colored Jones polynomial.</description>

      <title>Invariants of almost embeddings of graphs in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we motivate studies of the invariants from the title. A graph drawing in the plane is called an almost embedding if the images of any two non-adjacent simplices (i.e. vertices or edges) are disjoint. We introduce integer invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu numbers. We prove some relations between the invariants. We demonstrate connection of these relations to homology of the deleted product of a graph. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these invariants.
  This paper is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area (and to students). All the necessary definitions are recalled. We present some ideas of algebraic and geometric topology in a language accessible to non-topologists. However elementary, this paper is motivated by frontline of research; there are some conjectures and an open problem.</description>

      <title>The structure of MDC-Schottky extension groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M^{0}$ be a complete hyperbolic $3$-manifold whose conformal boundary is a closed Riemann surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$. If $M=M^{0} \cup S$, then let ${\rm Aut}(S;M)$ be the group of conformal automorphisms of $S$ which extend to hyperbolic isometries of $M^{0}$. If the natural homomorphism at fundamental groups, induced by the natural inclusion of $S$ into $M$, is not injective, then it is known that $|{\rm Aut}(S;M)| \leq 12(g-1)$. If $M$ is a handlebody, then it is also known that the upper bound is attained.
  In this paper, we consider the case when $M$ is homeomorphic to the connected sum of $g \geq 2$ copies of $D^{*} \times S^{1}$, where $D^{*}$ denotes the punctured closed unit disc and $S^{1}$ the unit circle. In this case, we obtain that: (i) if $g=2$, then $|{\rm Aut}(S;M)| \leq 12$ and the equality is attained, this happening for ${\rm Aut}(S;M)$ isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $12$, and (ii) if $g \geq 3$, then $|{\rm Aut}(S;M)|&lt;12(g-1)$, in particular, the above upper bound is not attained.</description>

      <title>Constraints on embedded spheres and real projective planes in 4-manifolds from Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariants of branched covers of prime degree, where the branch locus consists of embedded spheres. Aside from the formula itself, our calculations give rise to some new constraints on configurations of embedded spheres in 4-manifolds. Using similar methods, we also obtain new constraints on embeddings of real projective planes and spheres with a cusp singularity. Moreover, we show that the existence of certain configurations of surfaces would give rise to 4-manifolds of non-simple type. Our proof makes use of equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants as well as a gluing formula for the relative Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds with positive scalar curvature boundary.</description>

      <title>Torsion elements in the associated graded modules of filtrations over the Torelli group and the homology cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clasper surgery induces the $Y$-filtration $\{Y_n\mathcal{IC}\}_n$ over the monoid of homology cylinders, which serves as a $3$-dimensional analogue of the lower central series of the Torelli group of a surface. In this paper, we investigate the torsion submodules of the associated graded modules of these filtrations. To detect torsion elements, we introduce a homomorphism on $Y_n\mathcal{IC}/Y_{n+1}$ induced by the degree $n+2$ part of the LMO functor. Additionally, we provide a formula of this homomorphism for clasper surgery, and use it to demonstrate that every non-trivial torsion element in $Y_6\mathcal{IC}/Y_7$ has order $3$.</description>

      <title>Surface Quotients of Right-Angled Hyperbolic Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic buildings are central objects in both hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, exhibiting a wide range of intriguing characteristics, especially with respect to group actions. In this paper, we develop the theory of surface quotients of Fuchsian buildings. For a large family of Fuchsian buildings, we prove the existence of a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of the automorphism group of the Fuchsian building whose quotient is a compact surface without boundary. We also provide some necessary conditions for the existence of such lattices, in terms of the symmetries of the building. The proof is based on another result of ours that generators of the fundamental group of a tessellated surface can be chose by closed geodesics in the 1-skeleton of the tessellation, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>$(t,q)$-Series Invariants of Seifert Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gukov, Pei, Putrov, and Vafa developed a $q$-series invariant of negative definite plumbed $3$-manifolds with spin$^{c}$ structures, building on earlier work of Lawrence and Zagier. This was recently generalized to an an infinite family of two-variable $(t,q)$-series invariants by Akhmechet, Johnson, and Krushkal (AJK). We calculate one such series for all Seifert manifolds with $b_{1}=0.$ These results extend a previous theorem of Liles and McSpirit to any number of exceptional fibers and the Reduction Theorem of Gukov, Svoboda, and Katzarkov to the two-variable case. As a consequence, a previous result of Liles and McSpirit on modularity properties and radial limits is enhanced to a larger family of manifolds. We also calculate the infinite collection of $(t,q)$-series invariants for three infinite families of manifolds, finding mixed modularity properties for one such family.</description>

      <title>Searching for non-order-preserving braids algorithmically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-strand braid is order-preserving if its action on the free group $F_n$ preserves some bi-order of $F_n$. A braid $\beta$ is order-preserving if and only if the link $L$ obtained as the union of the closure of $\beta$ and its axis has bi-orderable complement. We describe and implement an algorithm which, given a non-order-preserving braid $\beta$, confirms this property and returns a proof that $\beta$ is indeed not order-preserving. Guided by the algorithm, we prove that the infinite family of simple 3-braids $\sigma_1\sigma_2^{2m+1}$ are not order-preserving for any integer $m$.</description>

      <title>Spinal open books and symplectic fillings with exotic fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinal open book decompositions provide a natural generalization of open book decompositions. We show that any minimal symplectic filling of a contact 3-manifold supported by a planar spinal open book is deformation equivalent to the complement of a positive multisection in a bordered Lefschetz fibration, which generalizes a result of Wendl. Along the way, we give an explicit local model for a non-compactly supported singularity in a generalized version of bordered Lefschetz fibrations, given by pseudoholomorphic foliations associated to the spinal open books. This provides new tools to classify symplectic fillings of a contact 3-manifold that is not supported by an amenable spinal open book, by studying monodromy factorizations in the newly defined spinal mapping class group. As an application, we complete the classification of strong fillings of all parabolic torus bundles, and make progress towards classifying symplectic fillings of contact 3-manifolds supported by non-planar open books.</description>

      <title>Cusp types of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining when a flat manifold can occur as a cusp cross-section within a given commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds of simplest type. This reduces the problem of identifying which commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds can contain a specific flat manifold as a cusp cross-section to a question involving rational representations of the flat manifold's holonomy group. As applications, we prove that a flat manifold $M$ with a holonomy group of odd order appears as a cusp cross-section in every commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds if and only if $b_1(M)\geq 3$. We also provide examples of flat manifolds that arise as cusp cross-sections in a unique commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds and exhibit examples of pairs of flat manifolds that can never appear as cusp cross-sections within the same commensurability class.</description>

      <title>The Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture for FAMED geometric triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an asymptotic expansion conjecture for the partition functions in Teichm\"uller TQFT; we then prove this conjecture for all FAMED geometric triangulations of hyperbolic knot complements, where FAMED means that the triangulation satisfies certain combinatorial properties.
  Our conjecture predicts that (1) the invariant decays exponentially with decrease rate the hyperbolic volume of a cone structure determined by the prescribed angle structure and (2) the 1-loop invariant, which conjecturally is the same as the adjoint twisted Reidemeister torsion, shows up as the 1-loop term in the asymptotic expansion formula.
  Based on this, we connect our volume conjecture with the Casson conjecture on angle structures by relating the exponential decay rate of the invariant to the volume functional defined on certain subspace of angle structures of ideal triangulations.
  Furthermore, for FAMED triangulations, we prove the existence of the Jones functions in Teichm\"uller TQFT, which is expected to be an analogue of the Kashaev invariant of the knot when the manifold is a knot complement in $S^3$.
  Then, for FAMED geometric triangulations, we obtain an asymptotic expansion formula for the Jones function, which generalizes the Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture in \cite{AK}.
  We also provide a simple argument to relate the asymptotic expansion formula of the Jones function with a weaker version of the AJ conjecture for the Teichm\"uller TQFT.
  Finally, we prove that the geometric ideal triangulations of hyperbolic twist knot complements constructed in \cite{BAGPN} are FAMED, which implies that these triangulations of twist knot complements satisfy all the previously mentioned results.</description>

      <title>Inducing recurrent flows by twisting on infinite surfaces with unbounded cuffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Riemann surface $X$ is parabolic if and only if the geodesic flow (for the hyperbolic metric) on the unit tangent bundle of $X$ is ergodic. Consider a Riemann surface $X$ with a single topological end and a sequence $\alpha_n$ of pairwise disjoint, simple closed geodesics converging to the end, called {\it cuffs}. Basmajian, the first and the third author, proved that when the lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ of cuffs are at most $2\log n$, the surface $X$ is parabolic. One could expect that having arbitrary large cuff lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ (think of $\ell (\alpha_n)=n!^{n!}$) would allow the geodesic flow to escape to infinity, thus making $X$ not parabolic.
  Contrary to this and motivated by their proof of the Surface Subgroup Theorem, Kahn and Markovi\'c conjectured that for every choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$, there is a choice of twists that would make $X$ parabolic. We show that their conjecture is essentially true. Namely, for any sequence of positive numbers $\{ a_n\}$, there is a choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)\geq a_n$ such that the (relative) twists by $1/2$ make $X$ parabolic. This result extends to the surfaces with countably many ends while it does not hold for uncountably many ends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely determine the free parts of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter (co)homology groups of finite cyclic biquandles, along with fully computing the torsion subgroups of their 1st and 2nd homology groups. Furthermore, we provide upper bounds for the orders of torsions in the 3rd and higher dimensional homology groups. This work partially solves the conjecture that the normalized set-theoretic Yang-Baxter homology of cyclic biquandles satisfy $H_{n}^{NYB}(C_{m}) = \mathbb{Z}^{(m-1)^{n-1}} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{m}$ when $n$ is odd and $H_{n}^{NYB}(C_{m}) = \mathbb{Z}^{(m-1)^{n-1}}$ when $n$ is even. In addition, we obtain cocycle representatives of a basis for the rational cohomology group of a cyclic biquandle and introduce several non-trivial torsion homology classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex having $n$ faces of dimension $k$, and $M$ a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-dimensional manifold. We prove that for $k\ge3$ odd $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if there are
  $\bullet$ a skew-symmetric $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with $\mathbb Z$-entries whose rank over $\mathbb Q$ does not exceed $rk H_k(M;\mathbb Z)$,
  $\bullet$ a general position PL map $f:K\to\mathbb R^{2k}$, and
  $\bullet$ orientations on $k$-faces of $K$ such that for any nonadjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$ of $K$ the element $A_{\sigma,\tau}$ equals to the algebraic intersection of $f\sigma$ and $f\tau$.
  We prove some analogues of this result including those for $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability. Our results generalize the Bikeev-Fulek-Kyn\v cl criteria for the $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability of graphs to surfaces, and are related to the Harris-Krushkal-Johnson-Pat\'ak-Tancer criteria for the embeddability of $k$-complexes into $2k$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The homology of moduli spaces of 4-manifolds may be infinitely generated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simply-connected closed manifold $X$ of $\dim X \neq 4$, the mapping class group $\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}(X))$ is known to be finitely generated. We prove that analogous finite generation fails in dimension 4. Namely, we show that there exist simply-connected closed smooth 4-manifolds whose mapping class groups are not finitely generated. More generally, for each $k&gt;0$, we prove that there are simply-connected closed smooth 4-manifolds $X$ for which $H_k(B\mathrm{Diff}(X);\mathbb{Z})$ are not finitely generated. The infinitely generated subgroup of $H_k(B\mathrm{Diff}(X);\mathbb{Z})$ which we detect are topologically trivial, and unstable under the connected sum of $S^2 \times S^2$. The proof uses characteristic classes obtained from Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Products of curves as ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $g_1, g_2 \ge 0$, this paper shows that there is a cocompact lattice $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{PU}(2,1)$ such that the ball quotient $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2$ is birational to a product $C_1 \times C_2$ of smooth projective curves $C_j$ of genus $g_j$. The only prior examples were $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, due to Deligne--Mostow and rediscovered by many others, and a lesser-known product of elliptic curves whose existence follows from work of Hirzebruch. Combined with related new examples, this answers the rational variant of a question of Gromov in the positive for surfaces of Kodaira dimension $\kappa \le 0$, namely that they admit deformations $V^\prime$ such that there is a compact ball quotient $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2$ with a rational map $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2 \dashrightarrow V^\prime$. Often the proof gives the stronger conclusion that $V^\prime$ is birational to a ball quotient orbifold. It also follows that every simply connected $4$-manifold is dominated by a complex hyperbolic manifold. All examples considered in this paper are shown to be arithmetic, and even arithmeticity of Hirzebruch's example appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Generalized Mazur Patterns and Immersed Heegaard Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing prior work of Levine, we give infinitely many examples of pattern knots P such that P(K) is not slice in any rational homology 4-ball, for any companion knot K. To show this, we establish a closed formula for the concordance invariants tau and epsilon of a family of satellite knots obtained from generalized Mazur patterns. Our main computational tool is the immersed curve technique from bordered Heegaard Floer homology arising from the work of Chen-Hanselman.</description>

      <title>New degeneration phenomenon for infinite-type Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the Teichm\"uller space of a surface $R$ is a deformation space of complex structures defined on $R$, its Bers boundary describes the degeneration of complex structures in a certain sense. In this paper, constructing a concrete example, we prove that if S is a Riemann surface of infinite type, there exists a Riemann surface with the marking, which is homeomorphic to the surface $R$ in the Bers boundary. We also show that many such degenerations exist in the Bers boundary.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies for Relatively Hyperbolic Virtually Special Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.12284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wise's Quasiconvex Hierarchy Theorem classifying hyperbolic virtually compact special groups in terms of quasiconvex hierarchies played an essential role in Agol's proof of the Virtual Haken Conjecture. Answering a question of Wise, we construct a new virtual quasiconvex hierarchy for relatively hyperbolic virtually compact special groups. We use this hierarchy to prove a generalization of Wise's Malnormal Special Quotient Theorem for relatively hyperbolic virtually compact special groups with arbitrary peripheral subgroups.</description>
