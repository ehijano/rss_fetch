      <title>Application of Deep Learning for Factor Timing in Asset Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper examines the performance of regression models (OLS linear regression, Ridge regression, Random Forest, and Fully-connected Neural Network) on the prediction of CMA (Conservative Minus Aggressive) factor premium and the performance of factor timing investment with them. Out-of-sample R-squared shows that more flexible models have better performance in explaining the variance in factor premium of the unseen period, and the back testing affirms that the factor timing based on more flexible models tends to over perform the ones with linear models. However, for flexible models like neural networks, the optimal weights based on their prediction tend to be unstable, which can lead to high transaction costs and market impacts. We verify that tilting down the rebalance frequency according to the historical optimal rebalancing scheme can help reduce the transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Application and practice of AI technology in quantitative investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, using machine learning technology to predict market trends may no longer be out of reach. In recent years, artificial intelligence has become a research hotspot in the academic circle,and it has been widely used in image recognition, natural language processing and other fields, and also has a huge impact on the field of quantitative investment. As an investment method to obtain stable returns through data analysis, model construction and program trading, quantitative investment is deeply loved by financial institutions and investors. At the same time, as an important application field of quantitative investment, the quantitative investment strategy based on artificial intelligence technology arises at the historic moment.How to apply artificial intelligence to quantitative investment, so as to better achieve profit and risk control, has also become the focus and difficulty of the research. From a global perspective, inflation in the US and the Federal Reserve are the concerns of investors, which to some extent affects the direction of global assets, including the Chinese stock market. This paper studies the application of AI technology, quantitative investment, and AI technology in quantitative investment, aiming to provide investors with auxiliary decision-making, reduce the difficulty of investment analysis, and help them to obtain higher returns.</description>

      <title>Dominance between combinations of infinite-mean Pareto random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic dominance between portfolios of independent and identically distributed (iid) extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) Pareto random variables. With the notion of majorization order, we show that a more diversified portfolio of iid extremely heavy-tailed Pareto random variables is larger in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result is further generalized for Pareto random variables caused by triggering events, random variables with tails being Pareto, bounded Pareto random variables, and positively dependent Pareto random variables. These results provide an important implication in investment: Diversification of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto profits uniformly increases investors' profitability, leading to a diversification benefit. Remarkably, different from the finite-mean setting, such a diversification benefit does not depend on the decision maker's risk aversion.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Period Black-Litterman Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Black-Litterman model is a framework for incorporating forward-looking expert views in a portfolio optimization problem. Existing work focuses almost exclusively on single-period problems and assumes that the horizon of expert forecasts matches that of the investor. We consider a multi-period generalization where the horizon of expert views may differ from that of a dynamically-trading investor. By exploiting an underlying graphical structure relating the asset prices and views, we derive the conditional distribution of asset returns when the price process is geometric Brownian motion. We also show that it can be written in terms of a multi-dimensional Brownian bridge. The new price process is an affine factor model with the conditional log-price process playing the role of a vector of factors. We derive an explicit expression for the optimal dynamic investment policy and analyze the hedging demand associated with the new covariate. More generally, the paper shows that Bayesian graphical models are a natural framework for incorporating complex information structures in the Black-Litterman model.</description>

      <title>To VaR, or Not to VaR, That is the Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider economic obstacles that limit the reliability and accuracy of value-at-risk (VaR). Investors who manage large market transactions should take into account the impact of the randomness of large trade volumes on predictions of price probability and VaR assessments. We introduce market-based probabilities of price and return that depend on the randomness of market trade values and volumes. Contrary to them, the conventional frequency-based price probability describes the case of constant trade volumes. We derive the dependence of market-based price volatility on the volatilities and correlation of trade values and volumes. In the coming years, that will limit the accuracy of price probability predictions to Gaussian approximations, and even the forecasts of market-based price volatility will be inaccurate and highly uncertain.</description>
