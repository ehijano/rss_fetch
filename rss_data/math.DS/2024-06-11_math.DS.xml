      <title>Discovery of differential equations using sparse state and parameter regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse regression strategy for discovery of ordinary and partial differential equations from incomplete and noisy data. Inference is performed over both equation parameters and state variables using a statistically motivated likelihood function. Sparsity is enforced by a selection algorithm which iteratively removes terms and compares models using statistical information criteria. Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. Illustrations involving canonical systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are used to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach. Accurate reconstruction of systems is found to be possible even in extreme cases of limited data and large observation noise.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Likelihood Approach to Filtering for advection-diffusion1 Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian data assimilation scheme is formulated for advection-dominated advective and diffusive evolutionary problems, based upon the Dynamic Likelihood (DLF) approach to filtering. The DLF was developed specifically for hyperbolic problems -waves-, and in this paper, it is extended via a split step formulation, to handle advection-diffusion problems. In the dynamic likelihood approach, observations and their statistics are used to propagate probabilities along characteristics, evolving the likelihood in time. The estimate posterior thus inherits phase information. For advection-diffusion the advective part of the time evolution is handled on the basis of observations alone, while the diffusive part is informed through the model as well as observations. We expect, and indeed show here, that in advection-dominated problems, the DLF approach produces better estimates than other assimilation approaches, particularly when the observations are sparse and have low uncertainty. The added computational expense of the method is cubic in the total number of observations over time, which is on the same order of magnitude as a standard Kalman filter and can be mitigated by bounding the number of forward propagated observations, discarding the least informative data.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily slow decay in the logarithmically averaged Sarnak conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017 Tao proposed a variant Sarnak's M\"{o}bius disjointness conjecture with logarithmic averaging: For any zero entropy dynamical system $(X,T)$, $\frac{1}{\log N} \sum_{n=1} ^N \frac{f(T^n x) \mu (n)}{n}= o(1)$ for every $f\in \mathcal{C}(X)$ and every $x\in X$. We construct examples showing that this $o(1)$ can go to zero arbitrarily slowly. Nonetheless, all of our examples satisfy the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the real Rel orbits of some translation surfaces in the stratum $\mathcal{H}(1,1)$. Specifically, surfaces that are tremors of the locus of branched double covers of tori. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on tremors of a surface so that the real Rel orbit is recurrent. As a consequence, we are able to provide explicit examples of trajectories of real Rel that are not recurrent.</description>

      <title>How big is a tiling's return module?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rank of a tiling's return module depends on the geometry of its tiles and is not a topological invariant. However, the rank of the first \v Cech cohomology $\check H^1(\Omega)$ gives upper and lower bounds for the size of the return module. For all sufficiently large patches, the rank of the return module is at most the same as the rank of the cohomology. For a generic choice of tile shapes and an arbitrary reference patch, the rank of the return module is at least the rank of $\check H^1(\Omega)$. Therefore, for generic tile shapes and sufficiently large patches, the rank of the return module is equal to the rank of $\check H^1(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>The Price of Cognition and Replicator Equations in Parallel Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are aiming to propose a novel mathematical model that studies the dynamics of synaptic damage in terms of concentrations of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters during neurotransmission processes. Our primary objective is to employ Wardrop's first and second principles within a neural network of the brain. In order to comprehensively incorporate Wardrop's first and second principles into the neural network of the brain, we introduce two novel concepts: \textit{neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's) equilibrium} and \textit{synapses optimum}. The \textit{neuropeptide/neurotransmitter equilibrium} refers to \textit{a distribution of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters that leads to uniform damage across all synaptic links}. Meanwhile, \textit{synapses optimum} is \textit{the most desirable distribution of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters that minimizes the cumulative damage experienced by all synapses}. In the context of a neural network within the brain, an analogue of the price of anarchy is \textit{the price of cognition} which is \textit{the most unfavorable ratio between the overall impairment caused by toxic neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's) equilibrium in comparison to the optimal state of synapses (synapses optimum)}. To put it differently, \textit{the price of cognition} measures \textit{the loss of cognitive ability resulting from increased concentrations of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters}. Additionally, a replicator equation is proposed within this framework that leads to the establishment of the synapses optimum during the neurotransmission process.</description>

      <title>On Learning what to Learn: heterogeneous observations of dynamics and establishing (possibly causal) relations among them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set. The second attempts to relate our framework to a form of causality: if one of the observation processes measures ``now'', while the second observation process measures ``in the future'', the function to be learned among what is common across observation processes constitutes a dynamical model for the system evolution.</description>

      <title>Modified Legendre-Gauss Collocation Method for Solving Optimal Control Problems with Nonsmooth Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modified form of Legendre-Gauss orthogonal direct collocation is developed for solving optimal control problems whose solutions are nonsmooth due to control discontinuities. This new method adds switch-time variables, control variables, and collocation conditions at both endpoints of a mesh interval, whereas these new variables and collocation conditions are not included in standard Legendre-Gauss orthogonal collocation. The modified Legendre-Gauss collocation method alters the search space of the resulting nonlinear programming problem and enables determining accurately the location of the nonsmoothness in the optimal control. The transformed adjoint system of the modified Legendre-Gauss collocation method is then derived and shown to satisfy a discrete form of the continuous variational necessary conditions for optimality. The method is motivated via a control-constrained triple-integrator minimum-time optimal control problem where the solution possesses a two-switch bang-bang optimal control structure. In addition, the method developed in this paper is compared with existing Gaussian quadrature collocation methods. The method developed in this paper is shown to be capable of accurately solving optimal control problems with a discontinuous optimal control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inviscid Burgers equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}:=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ forced by the derivative of a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We construct global solutions with mean $\theta$ simultaneously for all $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, and in addition construct their associated global shocks (which are unique except on a countable set of $\theta$). We then show that as $\theta$ changes, the solution only changes through the movement of the global shock, and give precise formulas for this movement. This is an analogue of previous results by the author and Yu Gu in the viscous case with white-in-time forcing, which related the derivative of the solution in $\theta$ to the density of a particle diffusing in the Burgers flow.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in empirical mutualistic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual species may experience diverse outcomes, from prosperity to extinction, in an ecological community subject to external and internal variations. Despite the wealth of theoretical results derived from random matrix ensembles, a theoretical framework still remains to be developed to understand species-level dynamical heterogeneity within a given community, hampering real-world ecosystems' theoretical assessment and management. Here, we consider empirical plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, additionally including all-to-all intragroup competition, where species abundance evolves under a Lotka-Volterra-type equation. Setting the strengths of competition and mutualism to be uniform, we investigate how individual species persist or go extinct under varying the interaction strengths. By employing bifurcation theory in tandem with numerical continuation, we elucidate transcritical bifurcations underlying species extinction and demonstrate that the Hopf bifurcation of unfeasible equilibria and degenerate transcritical bifurcations give rise to multistability, i.e., the coexistence of multiple attracting feasible equilibria. These bifurcations allow us to partition the parameter space into different regimes, each with distinct sets of extinct species, offering insights into how interspecific interactions generate one or multiple extinction scenarios within an ecological network.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models based on dynamical transport of measure, such as diffusion models, flow matching models, and stochastic interpolants, learn an ordinary or stochastic differential equation whose trajectories push initial conditions from a known base distribution onto the target. While training is cheap, samples are generated via simulation, which is more expensive than one-step models like GANs. To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism. With experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, we show that flow map matching leads to high-quality samples with significantly reduced sampling cost compared to diffusion or stochastic interpolant methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided weak-form discovery of reduced-order models for trapped ultracold hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a highly collisional, ultracold but nondegenerate gas of polar molecules. Confined within a harmonic trap, the gas is subject to fluid-gaseous coupled dynamics that lead to a breakdown of first-order hydrodynamics. An attempt to treat these higher-order hydrodynamic effects was previously made with a Gaussian ansatz and coarse-graining model parameter [R. R. W. Wang &amp; J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 108, 013322 (2023)], leading to an approximate set of equations for a few collective observables accessible to experiments. Here we present substantially improved reduced-order models for these same observables, admissible beyond previous parameter regimes, discovered directly from particle simulations using the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics). The interpretable nature of the learning algorithm enables estimation of previously unknown physical quantities and discovery of model terms with candidate physical mechanisms, revealing new physics in mixed collisional regimes. Our approach constitutes a general framework for data-driven model identification leveraging known physics.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Hausdorff and box dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hausdorff and box dimension are two familiar notions of fractal dimension. Box dimension can be larger than Hausdorff dimension, because in the definition of box dimension, all sets in the cover have the same diameter, but for Hausdorff dimension there is no such restriction. This thesis focuses on a family of dimensions parameterised by $\theta \in (0,1)$, called the intermediate dimensions, which are defined by requiring that $\mbox{diam}(U) \leq (\mbox{diam}(V))^{\theta}$ for all sets $U,V$ in the cover.
  We begin by generalising the intermediate dimensions to allow for greater refinement in how the relative sizes of the covering sets are restricted. These new dimensions can recover the interpolation between Hausdorff and box dimension for compact sets whose intermediate dimensions do not tend to the Hausdorff dimension as $\theta \to 0$. We also use a Moran set construction to prove a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of Dini derivatives, for a given function to be realised as the intermediate dimensions of a set.
  We proceed to prove that the intermediate dimensions of limit sets of infinite conformal iterated function systems are given by the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This applies to sets defined using continued fraction expansions, and has applications to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images.
  Finally, we determine a formula for the intermediate dimensions of all self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets. The functions display features not witnessed in previous examples, such as having countably many phase transitions. We deduce that two carpets have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the multifractal spectra of the corresponding uniform Bernoulli measures coincide.</description>

Abstract: Our context is Filippov systems defined on two-dimensional manifolds having a finite number of tangency points. We prove that topological transitivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of non-deterministic chaos when the Filippov system has non-empty sliding or escaping regions. A fundamental result for continuous flows is the equivalence of topological transitivity and existence of a dense orbit. We prove in our setting that topological transitivity for Filippov systems is indeed equivalent to the existence of a dense Filippov orbit, although, in contrast to the continuous case, we are not able to garantee that the dense orbit implies the existence of a residual set of dense orbits. Finally we prove that, in this context, topological transitivity implies strictly positive topological entropy for the Filippov system. This calculation is made using techniques similar to those from symbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a stochastic port-Hamiltonian car-following model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian systems are pertinent representations of many nonlinear physical systems. In this study, we formulate and analyse a general class of stochastic car-following models with a systematic port-Hamiltonian structure. The model class is a generalisation of classical car-following approaches, including the optimal velocity model of Bando et al. (1995), the full velocity difference model of Jiang et al. (2001), and recent stochastic following models based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In contrast to traditional models where the interaction is totally asymmetric (i.e., depending only on the speed and distance to the predecessor), the port-Hamiltonian car-following model also depends on the distance to the follower. We determine the exact stability condition of the finite system with $N$ vehicles and periodic boundaries. The stable system is ergodic with a unique Gaussian invariant measure. Other properties of the model are studied using numerical simulation. It turns out that the Hamiltonian component improves the flow stability and reduces the total energy in the system. Furthermore, it prevents the problematic formation of stop-and-go waves with oscillatory dynamics, even in the presence of stochastic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. Instead, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>

      <title>Robust non-computability of dynamical systems and computability of robust dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between the stability of the dynamical system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ and the computability of its basins of attraction. We present a computable $C^{\infty}$ system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ that possesses a computable and stable equilibrium point, yet whose basin of attraction is robustly non-computable in a neighborhood of $f$ in the sense that both the equilibrium point and the non-computability of its associated basin of attraction persist when $f$ is slightly perturbed. This indicates that local stability near a stable equilibrium point alone is insufficient to guarantee the computability of its basin of attraction. However, we also demonstrate that the basins of attraction associated with a structurally stable - globally stable (robust) - planar system defined on a compact set are computable. Our findings suggest that the global stability of a system and the compactness of the domain play a pivotal role in determining the computability of its basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $C^2$-cosine type potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Anderson localization, strong dynamical localization and the $(\frac 12-)$-H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS) for some multi-dimensional discrete quasi-periodic (QP) Schr\"odinger operators with asymmetric $C^2$-cosine type potentials. We extend both the iteration scheme of \cite{CSZ23a} and the interlacing method of \cite{FV21} to handle asymmetric Rellich functions with collapsed gaps.</description>
