      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard, even when protocols are limited to a constant number of alternations, resolving a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2505.12345); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols that use only constant alternations, so NP-hardness holds under stronger restrictions than those considered in concurrent and independent work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff (arXiv:2507.06789), whose proof requires unbounded alternations.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound, and we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Subset Sum in Near-Linear Pseudopolynomial Time and Polynomial Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multiset $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ of positive integers and a target integer $t$, the Subset Sum problem asks if there is a subset of $A$ that sums to $t$. Bellman's [1957] classical dynamic programming algorithm runs in $O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space. Since then, there have been multiple improvements in both time and space complexity.
  Notably, Bringmann [SODA 2017] uses a two-step color-coding technique to obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and $\tilde{O}(t)$ space. On the other hand, there are polynomial space algorithms -- for example, Jin, Vyas and Williams [SODA 2021] build upon the algorithm given by Bringmann, using a clever algebraic trick first seen in Kane's Logspace algorithm, to obtain an $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(\log(nt))$ space algorithm. A natural question, asked by Jin et al. is if there is an $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time algorithm running in poly$(n, \log t)$ space. Another natural question is whether it is possible to construct a deterministic polynomial space algorithm with time complexity comparable to that of Bellman's.
  In this paper, we answer both questions affirmatively. We build on the framework given by Jin et al., using a multipoint evaluation-based approach to speed up a bottleneck step in their algorithm. We construct a deterministic algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$ space and a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$ space.</description>

      <title>Minimal Model Reasoning in Description Logics: Don't Try This at Home!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of `pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal, has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.</description>

      <title>A full dichotomy for Holant$^c$, inspired by quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holant problems are a family of counting problems parameterised by sets of algebraic-complex valued constraint functions, and defined on graphs. They arise from the theory of holographic algorithms, which was originally inspired by concepts from quantum computation. Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results about holant problems in a concise way and to derive two new dichotomies: one for a new family of problems, which we call Holant$^+$, and, building on this, a full dichotomy for Holant$^c$. These two families of holant problems assume the availability of certain unary constraint functions -- the two pinning functions in the case of Holant$^c$, and four functions in the case of Holant$^+$ -- and allow arbitrary sets of algebraic-complex valued constraint functions otherwise. The dichotomy for Holant$^+$ also applies when inputs are restricted to instances defined on planar graphs. In proving these complexity classifications, we derive an original result about entangled quantum states.</description>
