      <title>Time-domain interferometry of electron weak localization through terahertz nonlinear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the nonlinear optical response of disordered electrons in the regime of weak (anti)localization. Our analytical and numerical calculations reveal that, in orthogonal/symplectic class systems, two consecutive, phase coherent optical pulses generates an electric current echo that appears after the second pulse, and at a time equal to the pulse delay time. The current echo reflects the quantum interference between a self-intersecting electron path and its time reversal partner, and, therefore, provide a time-domain interferometry of weak (anti)localization. Our results can be potentially tested on disordered metal films by using terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy or ultrafast transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Controllable suppression of Non-Hermitian skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a phenomenon in which the bulk states tends to the boundary in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and has a wide range of application scenarios. The fully understanding of the skin mode anomalies in NHSEs is vital for the application. Recently, some innovative work reported the suppression [Phys. Rev. Lett 127, 256402 (2021)] and enhancement [Phys. Rev. Lett 131, 116601 (2023)] of NHSEs by magnetic field, respectively. In our work, we constructed magnetic field-like onsite potential energy distribution and random-like onsite potential energy distribution, and found that onsite potential energy has non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns on skin modes. Non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns are two typical forms in the transition from order to disorder. Only relying on onsite potential energy, not only we have obtained a profound understanding of the connection and difference between order and disorder, but also developed a general strategy to achieve both robustness and adjustability of the skin modes. By linking with the scaling theory in disorder, the controllable suppression of NHSEs, based on mutual transformation between order and disorder, is generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Polarization textures in crystal supercells with topological bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a highly tunable platform for studying the momentum space topology of the electronic wavefunctions and real space topology in terms of skyrmions, merons, and vortices of an order parameter. Such textures for electronic polarization can exist in moir\'e heterostructures. A quantum-mechanical definition of local polarization textures in insulating supercells was recently proposed. Here, we propose a definition for local polarization that is also valid for systems with topologically non-trivial bands. We introduce semilocal hybrid polarizations, which are valid even when the Wannier functions in a system cannot be made exponentially localized in all dimensions. We use this definition to explicitly show that nontrivial real-space polarization textures can exist in topologically non-trivial systems with non-zero Chern number under (1) an external superlattice potential, and (2) under a stacking-induced moir\'e potential. In the latter, we find that while the magnitude of the local polarization decreases discontinuously across a topological phase transition from trivial to topologically nontrivial, the polarization does not completely vanish. Our findings suggest that band topology and real-space polar topology may coexist in real materials.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive transport on lattices with nodal impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that 1D lattice models exhibit superdiffusive transport in the presence of random "nodal impurities" in the absence of interaction. Here a nodal impurity is defined as a localized state, the wave function of which has zeros (nodes) in momentum space. The dynamics exponent $z$, a defining quantity for transport behaviors, is computed to establish this result. To be specific, in a disordered system having only nodal impurities, the dynamical exponent $z=4n/(4n-1)$ where $n$ is the order of the node. If the system has time reversal, the nodes appear in pairs and the dynamical exponent can be enhanced to $z=8n/(8n-1)$. As $1&lt;z&lt;2$, both cases indicate superdiffusive transport.</description>

      <title>No bulk thermal currents in massive Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the energy current flowing in the bulk of a (2+1)-dimensional system of massive Dirac fermions and along a (1+1)-dimensional domain wall generated by flipping the sign of the particle mass. We show that, at low temperatures and in the long-wavelenghth limit, the system does not support a bulk thermal Hall current proportional to the temperature gradient. The only such contribution is due to states localised at the domain wall. This puts an end to a controversy existing in the literature and amends previous results obtained via first-order perturbation calculations.</description>

      <title>Hall response in interacting bosonic and fermionic ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases (Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the Galilean invariant case.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of the semiclassical theory and the response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is long believed that the response theory can give quantum correction (or interband coherent effects) to the semiclassical theory, while both formulations essentially are perturbatively solving the time-dependent Sch\"odinger equation in a periodic potential probed by the electric field within the independent-particle approximation. In this work, by extending the semiclassical theory under a uniform electric field to the nonlinear AC regime, we show explicitly that up to the second order of the electric field, the AC semiclassical theory gives exactly the same results as the response theory in the absence of relaxation. Remarkably, this equivalence can be expected even in DC limit when the zero-frequency divergence is regulated on the same footing. Particularly, at the linear order of the electric field, we show that both formulations deliver the same Drude current, intrinsic anomalous Hall current, and the displacement current, where the last one arising from the time variation of the first-order \textit{positional shift} can only appear in AC transport and is usually overlooked. Furthermore, at the second order of the electric field, we show that all the well-known transport effects, including the nonlinear Drude and Hall effects (that can be driven by the Berry curvature dipole or/and quantum metric dipole) can be derived by both formulations. Additionally, we show that the nonlinear displacement current due to the time variation of the second-order \textit{positional shift} and the nonlinear intrinsic Ohmic current due to the second-order energy correction (which is determined by the first-order \textit{positional shift}) in AC semiclassical theory can also be obtained by response theory.</description>

      <title>Excitonic response in TMD heterostructures from first-principles: impact of stacking, twisting, and interlayer distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform to engineer optoelectronic devices tuning their optical properties via stacking, twisting, or straining. Using ab initio Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we predict the electronic and optical (absorption and photoluminescence spectra) properties of MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayers with different stacking and twisting. We analyse the valley splitting and optical transitions, and explain the enhancement or quenching of the inter- and intra-layer exciton states. Contrary to established models, that focus on transitions near the high-symmetry point K, our results include all possible transitions across the Brillouin Zone. This result, for a twisted Se-based heterostructures, in an interlayer exciton with significant electron density in both layers and a mixed intralayer exciton distributed over both MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$. We propose that it should be possible to produce an inverted order of the excitonic states in some MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, where the energy of the intralayer WSe$_2$ exciton is lower than that in MoSe$_2$. We predict the variability of the exciton peak positions ($\sim$100 meV) and the exciton radiative lifetimes, from pico- to nano-seconds, and even micro-seconds in twisted bilayers. The control of exciton energies and lifetimes paves the way towards applications in quantum information technologies and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Band structure of Bi surfaces formed on Bi2Se3 upon exposure to air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has been the focus of intense interest over the past decade due to its topological properties. Bi surfaces are known to form on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ upon exposure to atmosphere, but their electronic structure has not been investigated. We report band structure measurements of such Bi surfaces using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Measured spectra can be well explained by the band structure of a single bilayer of Bi on Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and show that Bi surfaces consistently dominate the photoemission signal for air exposure times of at least 1 hour. These results demonstrate that atmospheric effects should be taken into consideration when identifying two-dimensional transport channels, and when designing surface-sensitive measurements of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, ideally limiting air exposure to no more than a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Inductive magnon noise spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State tomography allows to characterize quantum states, and was recently applied to reveal the dynamic magnetization state of a parametrically driven magnet. The identification of non-classical states, such as squeezed states, relies on a careful analysis of their emission and their distinction from thermal and vacuum fluctuations. A technique allowing to detect equilibrium magnetization fluctuations is a crucial first step in this regard. In this Letter, we show that inductive magnon noise spectroscopy (iMNS) allows to characterize the thermal magnetization fluctuations of a ferromagnetic thin film in a broadband coplanar waveguide-based scheme. Relative to a cold microwave background, the microwaves emitted by the equilibrium magnetization fluctuations can be detected via spectrum analysis. We provide a comprehensive picture of our microwave system by quantitatively modeling its response, including the thermalizing influence of the cables. The model allows for direct comparison to low-power broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements with excellent agreement, corroborating the equilibrium character of the iMNS measurement by probing the linear response of the equilibrium state. Our work thus demonstrates broadband access to the equilibrium properties of magnetization fluctuations using a purely inductive approach.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Exciton Diffusion in WSe$_2$/Graphene Heterostructures Revealed by Heterodyne Transient Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using heterodyne transient grating spectroscopy, we observe a significant enhancement of exciton diffusion within a monolayer WSe$_2$ stacked on top of graphene. We further demonstrate that the diffusion dynamics can be optically tuned on the ultrafast time scale (i.e. a few picoseconds) by altering the photoexcited charge carrier density in graphene. The results reveal that, on a time scale of a few picoseconds, the effective diffusion constant in the WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructure is approximately 40 cm$^2 $/s, representing a substantial improvement over the 2 cm$^2 $/s typical for an isolated monolayer of WSe$_2$. The enhanced diffusion can be understood in terms of a transient screening of impurities, charge traps, and defect states in WSe$_2$ by photoexcited charge carriers in graphene. Furthermore, we observe that the diffusion within WSe$_2$ is affected by interlayer interactions, like charge transfer, exhibiting different dynamic states depending on the incident excitation fluence. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of screening and diffusion processes in heterostructures of 2D semiconductors and graphene and provide valuable insights for future applications of these systems in ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>NH$_3$ adsorption and competition with H$_2$O on a hydroxylated aluminosilicate surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between ammonia (NH$_3$) and (alumino)silicates is of fundamental and applied importance, yet the specifics of NH$_3$ adsorption on silicate surfaces remain largely unexplored, mainly because of experimental challenges related to their electrically insulating nature. An example of this knowledge gap is evident in the context of ice nucleation on silicate dust, wherein the role of NH$_3$ for ice nucleation remains debated. This study explores the fundamentals of the interaction between NH$_3$ and microcline feldspar (KAlSi$_3$O$_8$), a common aluminosilicate with outstanding ice nucleation abilities. Atomically resolved non-contact atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory-based calculations elucidate the adsorption geometry of NH$_3$ on the lowest-energy surface of microcline, the (001) facet, and its interplay with surface hydroxyls and molecular water. NH$_3$ and H$_2$O are found to adsorb molecularly in the same adsorption sites, creating H-bonds with the proximate surface silanol (Si-OH) and aluminol (Al-OH) groups. Despite the closely matched adsorption energies of the two molecules, NH$_3$ readily yields to replacement by H$_2$O, challenging the notion that ice nucleation on microcline proceeds via the creation of an ordered H$_2$O layer atop pre-adsorbed NH$_3$ molecules.</description>

      <title>Relations between normal state nonreciprocal transport and the superconducting diode effect in the trivial and topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport effects can occur in the normal state of conductors and in superconductors when both inversion and time-reversal symmetry are broken. Here, we consider systems where magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) of the energy spectrum due to an externally applied magnetic field results in a rectification effect in the normal state and a superconducting (SC) diode effect when the system is proximitised by a superconductor. Focussing on nanowire systems, we obtain analytic expressions for both normal state rectification and SC diode effects that reveal the commonalities - as well as differences - between these two phenomena. Furthermore, we consider the nanowire brought into an (almost) helical state in the normal phase or a topological superconducting phase when proximitised. In both cases this reveals that the topology of the system considerably modifies its nonreciprocal transport properties. Our results provide new insights into how to determine the origin of nonreciprocal effects and further evince the strong connection of nonreciprocal transport with the topological properties of a system.</description>

      <title>Synchronization-induced violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations affect the functionality of nanodevices. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), derived within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, show that a minimal amount of dissipation is required to obtain a given relative energy current dispersion, that is, current precision has a thermodynamic cost. It is therefore of great interest to explore the possibility that TURs are violated, particularly for quantum systems, leading to accurate currents at lower cost. Here, we show that two quantum harmonic oscillators are synchronized by coupling to a common thermal environment, at strong dissipation and low temperature. In this regime, periodically modulated couplings to a second thermal reservoir, breaking time-reversal symmetry and taking advantage of non-Markovianity of this latter reservoir, lead to strong violation of TURs for local work currents, while maintaining finite output power. Our results pave the way for the use of synchronization in the thermodynamics of precision.</description>

      <title>Strategy of a separation technique for different particles with the same size and zeta potential: Application of non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we use knowledge gained from our recent study to present a technique for separation of nanoparticles such as exosomes, anticancer drugs, and vaccines. The technique involves adding non-adsorptive polymers to a system in which two types of nanoparticles with the same size and zeta potential are dispersed. The different types of nanoparticles can be separated based on differences in their hydrophobicities and softness of the polymer. Using the non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory and assuming a realistic model system, we were able to separate the two types of the particles with the same size and zeta potential in the model system.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Power Single-Sensor-Based E-Nose System Powered by Duty Cycling and Deep Learning for Real-Time Gas Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel, ultralow-power single-sensor-based electronic nose (e-nose) system for real-time gas identification, distinguishing itself from conventional sensor-array-based e-nose systems whose power consumption and cost increase with the number of sensors. Our system employs a single metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor built on a suspended 1D nanoheater, driven by duty cycling-characterized by repeated pulsed power inputs. The sensor's ultrafast thermal response, enabled by its small size, effectively decouples the effects of temperature and surface charge exchange on the MOS nanomaterial's conductivity. This provides distinct sensing signals that alternate between responses coupled with and decoupled from the thermally enhanced conductivity, all within a single time domain during duty cycling. The magnitude and ratio of these dual responses vary depending on the gas type and concentration, facilitating the early-stage gas identification of five gas types within 30 s via a convolutional neural network (classification accuracy = 93.9%, concentration regression error = 19.8%). Additionally, the duty-cycling mode significantly reduces power consumption by up to 90%, lowering it to 160 $\mu$W to heat the sensor to 250$^\circ$C. Manufactured using only wafer-level batch microfabrication processes, this innovative e-nose system promises the facile implementation of battery-driven, long-term, and cost-effective IoT monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor--ferromagnetic-insulator bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Revealing mode formation in quasi-bound states in the continuum metasurfaces via near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, all of which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high quality factors and strong near-field enhancement. Here, we quantitatively investigate the mode formation in quasi-BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique. We find that the quasi-BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10 x 10-unit cells much smaller than expected from far-field measurements. Furthermore, we show that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi-BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far-field and near-field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Multifold topological semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of topological semimetals with multifold band crossings has opened up a new and exciting frontier in the field of topological physics. These materials exhibit large Chern numbers, leading to long double Fermi arcs on their surfaces, which are protected by either crystal symmetries or topological order. The impact of these multifold crossings extends beyond surface science, as they are not constrained by the Poincar\'e classification of quasiparticles and only need to respect the crystal symmetry of one of the 1651 magnetic space groups. Consequently, we observe the emergence of free fermionic excitations in solid-state systems that have no high-energy counterparts, protected by non-symmorphic symmetries. In this work, we review the recent theoretical and experimental progress made in the field of multifold topological semimetals. We begin with the theoretical prediction of the so-called multifold fermions and discuss the subsequent discoveries of chiral and magnetic topological semimetals. Several experiments that have realized chiral semimetals in spectroscopic measurements are described, and we discuss the future prospects of this field. These exciting developments have the potential to deepen our understanding of the fundamental properties of quantum matter and inspire new technological applications in the future.</description>

Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show unique physical, optical, and electronic properties. The known phases of TMDs are 2H and 3R in bulk form, 1T and associated reconstructions, and 1H in monolayer form. This paper reports a hypothetical phase, 9R, that may exist in TMDs (Mo, W)(S, Se, Te)$_2$, meeting both dynamical stability and elastic stability criteria. 9R phase has the same space group as 3R, $i.e.$ rhombohedral $R3m$ without inversion symmetry, and has 9 layers in a conventional unit cell. We find that 9R has an energy within 1 meV per formula unit of 3R and can be energetically favored by a particular strain condition. We further calculate the electronic, elastic, piezoelectric, Raman, and second-harmonic generation signatures of 9R TMDs and compare them with the corresponding 2H and 3R phases. 9R has similar properties to 3R but shows distinctive Raman peaks in the low-frequency regime, improved piezoelectric properties, and unique band splitting arising from layer coupling at the conduction band minimum. These distinct properties make 9R an attractive candidate for applications in piezotronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between a topological degeneracy and the residue degeneracy (also known as the residue entropy) of quantum criticality remains as an important but not thoroughly understood topic. We find that this topological degeneracy, provided by a Majorana zero mode pair, relaxes the otherwise strictly requested symmetry requirement, to observe the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition (QPT) of a dissipative resonant level. Our work indicates that the topological degeneracy can be potentially viewed as an auxiliary symmetry that realizes a robust boundary QPT. The relaxation of the symmetry requirement extends the transition from a point to a finite area, thus greatly reducing the difficulty to experimentally observe the QPT. This topology-involved exotic BKT phase diagram, on the other hand, provides another piece of evidence that can further confirm the existence of a Majorana zero mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a robust topological phenomenon featuring quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. We report the QAHE in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/monolayer WS2 heterostructure. Distinct from other experimentally confirmed QAHE systems, this system has neither magnetic element nor moir\'e superlattice effect. The QAH states emerge at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = +-5 at temperatures up to about 1.5 K. This large QAHE arises from the synergy of the electron correlation in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the gate-tuning effect, and the proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit-coupling. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and band topology physics, and may enable a route for engineering chiral Majorana edge states.</description>

Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid in a channel formed in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with no-slip boundary conditions. To generate vorticity in the fluid the flow is influenced by an array of micromagnets on the top of 2DEG. We analyse the viscous boundary layer and demonstrate anti-Poiseuille behaviour in this region. Furthermore we predict a longitudinal voltage modulation, where a periodic magnetic field generates a voltage term periodic in the direction of transport.From the experimental point of view we propose a method for a boundary-independent measurement of the viscosity of different electron fluids. The results are applicable to graphene away from the charge neutrality point and to semiconductors.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Graphene Nanoribbons with Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid nanoribbon geometries. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the effective theory remains applicable in the presence of Hubbard interactions. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the origin of the localisations to date.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Quantum Simulation on Andreev Bound State Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of superconducting qubits and cavities offer a promising route for realizing highly controllable artificial materials. However, many analog simulations of superconducting circuit hardware have focused on bosonic systems. Fermionic simulations, on the other hand, have largely relied on digital approaches that require non-local qubit couplings, which could limit their scalability. Here, we propose and study an alternative approach for analog fermionic quantum simulation based on arrays of coherently coupled mesoscopic Josephson junctions. These Josephson junction arrays implement an effective superlattice of Andreev bound state "atoms" that can trap individual fermionic quasiparticles and, due to their wavefunction overlap, mediate quasiparticle hoppings. By developing a Wannier function approach, we show that these Andreev bound state arrays form an all-superconducting and circuit QED-compatible platform for emulating lattice models of fermionic quasiparticles that are phase- and gate-programmable. Interestingly, we also find that the junction lattices can undergo a topological transition and host fermionic boundary modes that can be probed by conductance measurements. We hope our results will inspire the realization of artificial and possibly topological materials on Andreev bound state quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic domain wall bimerons (DWBMs) are topological spin textures residing within the magnetic domain walls of in-plane magnets. In this study, we employ both numerical and analytical methods to explore the stabilization of N\'eel-type DWBMs in a ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayer, facilitated by interfacial Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI), and their dynamics when excited by damping-like spin-orbit torque. Our findings reveal two unique and intriguing dynamic mechanisms, which depend on the polarization direction of the spin current: In the first scenario, the magnetic domain wall serves as a track that confines the motion of the bimeron and effectively suppresses the skyrmion Hall effect. In the second scenario, pushing the magnetic domain wall triggers a rapid sliding of the bimeron along the wall. This process significantly enhances the dynamics of the DWBM, resulting in a velocity increase of approximately 40 times compared to other topological solitons, including skyrmions and bimeron solitons. The damping effect plays a varied role in these mechanisms. Our results highlight the potential advantages of the skyrmion Hall effect in developing energy-efficient spintronic devices based on domain wall bimerons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elementary point charge excitations in 3+1D topological phases can condense along a line and form a descendant excitation called the Cheshire string. Unlike the elementary flux loop excitations in the system, Cheshire strings do not have to appear as the boundary of a 2d disc and can exist on open line segments. On the other hand, Cheshire strings are different from trivial excitations that can be created with local unitaries in 0d and finite depth quantum circuits in 1d and higher. In this paper, we show that to create a Cheshire string, one needs a linear depth circuit that acts sequentially along the length of the string. Once a Cheshire string is created, its deformation, movement and fusion can be realized by finite depths circuits. This circuit depth requirement applies to all nontrivial descendant excitations including symmetry-protected topological chains and the Majorana chain.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions out of quantum Hall states in moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental breakthroughs in observing Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in moir\'e materials, we propose and study various unconventional phase transitions between quantum Hall phases and Fermi liquids or charge ordered phases upon tuning the bandwidth. At a fixed rational lattice filling $\nu$, we describe a quantum Ginzburg-Landau theory to describe the intertwinement between the FQAH and Charge Density Wave (CDW) orders. We use this theory to describe phase transitions between the FQAH and a CDW insulator. The critical theory for a direct second order transition resembles that of the familiar deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) but with an additional Chern-Simons term. At filling -1/2, we study the possibility of a continuous transition between the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and the Fermi liquid (FL) building on and refining previous work by Barkeshli and McGreevy. Crucially we show that filling constraints ignored in that work ensure that translation symmetry alone is enough to enable a second order CFL-FL transition. We argue that there must be critical CDW fluctuations though neither phase has long range CDW order. We present experimental signatures the most striking of which is a universal jump of both longitudinal and Hall resistivities at the critical point. With disorder, we argue that the CDW order gets pinned and the CFL-FL evolution happens through an intermediate electrically insulating phase with mobile neutral fermions. A clean analog of this insulating phase with long range CDW order and a neutral fermi surface can potentially also exist. We also present a critical theory for the CFL to FL transition at filling -3/4. Our work opens up a new avenue to realize deconfined criticality and fractionalized phases beyond familiar Landau level physics in the moire Chern band system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do quantum correlations lead to better performance with respect to several different systems working independently? For quantum thermal machines, the question is whether a working medium (WM) made of $N$ constituents exhibits better performance than $N$ independent engines working in parallel. Here, by inspecting a microscopic model with the WM composed by two non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators, we show that the presence of a common environment can mediate non-trivial correlations in the WM leading to better quantum heat engine performance -- maximum power and efficiency -- with respect to an independent configuration. Furthermore, this advantage is striking for strong dissipation, a regime in which two independent engines cannot deliver any useful power. Our results show that dissipation can be exploited as a useful resource for quantum thermal engines, and are corroborated by optimization techniques here extended to non-Markovian quantum heat engines.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has emerged as a subfield of spintronics, where an AFM N\'eel vector is used as a state variable. Efficient electric control and detection of the N\'eel vector are critical for spintronic applications. This review article features fundamental properties of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) as spintronic devices where such electric control and detection can be realized. We emphasize critical requirements for observing a large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in AFMTJs with collinear and noncollinear AFM electrodes, such as a momentum-dependent spin polarization and N\'eel spin currents. We further discuss spin torques in AFMTJs that are capable of N\'eel vector switching. Overall, AFMTJs have potential to become a new standard for spintronics providing larger magnetoresistive effects, few orders of magnitude faster switching speed, and much higher packing density than conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet engineering</title>

Abstract: In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb assisted hopping on STM signal: extended two site Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping. We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current (instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis used in the literature so far). We find an exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling between tip and sample) expression for the current as a function of the bias voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are non-trivial corrections - where the $dI/d\mathcal{V}$ (the rate of change of the current with respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard model analysis would predict. We also show that for realistic conditions the corrections predicted here are order one.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>

Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>
