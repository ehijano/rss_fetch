      <title>An analogue of the Milnor conjecture for the de Rham-Witt complex in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the modulo $2$ de Rham-Witt complex of a field of characteristic $2$, in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-geometric fixed points of real topological restriction homology TRR. This is analogous to the conjecture of Milnor, proved by Kato for fields of characteristic $2$, which describes the modulo $2$ Milnor K-theory in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the Witt group of symmetric forms. Our proof provides a somewhat explicit description of these objects, as well as a calculation of the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed points of TRR and of real topological cyclic homology, for all fields.</description>

      <title>Borel-Hirzebruch type formula for the graph equivariant cohomology of a projective bundle over a GKM-graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the GKM theoretical counterpart of the equivariant complex vector bundles as the "leg bundle". We also provide a definition for the projectivization of a leg bundle and prove the Borel-Hirzebruch type formula for its graph equivariant cohomology, assuming that the projectivization is again a GKM graph. Furthermore, we study the realization of the projective GKM fiber bundle, in the sense of Guillemin-Sabatini-Zara, can be obtained from the projectivization of a leg bundle.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of directed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore links between natural homology and persistent homology for the classification of directed spaces. The former is an algebraic invariant of directed spaces, a semantic model of concurrent programs. The latter was developed in the context of topological data analysis, in which topological properties of point-cloud data sets are extracted while eliminating noise. In both approaches, the evolution homological properties are tracked through a sequence of inclusions of usual topological spaces. Exploiting this similarity, we show that natural homology may be considered a persistence object, and may be calculated as a colimit of uni-dimensional persistent homologies along traces. Finally, we suggest further links and avenues of future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Homological Lie brackets on moduli spaces and pushforward operations in twisted K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of pushforward operations for principal $G$-bundles equipped with a certain type of orientation.
  In the case $G=BU(1)$ and orientations in twisted K-theory we construct two pushforward operations, the projective Euler operation, whose existence was conjectured by Joyce, and the projective rank operation. We classify all stable pushforward operations in this context and show that they are all generated by the projective Euler and rank operation.
  As an application, we construct a graded Lie algebra structure on the homology of a commutative H-space with a compatible $BU(1)$-action and orientation. These play an important role in the context of wall-crossing formulas in enumerative geometry.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Pl\"ucker formulas using equivariant cohomology of coincident root strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new method to calculate the universal cohomology classes of coincident root loci. We show a polynomial behavior of them and apply this result to prove that generalized Pl\"ucker formulas are polynomials in the degree, just as the classical Pl\"ucker formulas counting the bitangents and flexes of a degree $d$ generic plane curve. We establish an upper bound for the degrees of these polynomials, and we calculate the leading terms of those whose degrees reach this upper bound.
  We believe that the paper is understandable without detailed knowledge of equivariant cohomology. It may serve as a demonstration of the use of equivariant cohomology in enumerative geometry through the examples of coincident root strata. We also explain how the equivariant method can be "translated" into the traditional non-equivariant method of resolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a bordism version of Gromov's linearity conjecture over a large family of acyclic groups, for manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Every group embeds into one of these acyclic groups, and thus it follows that the conjecture is true if one allows to enlarge a given group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. In the PL case, our results hold without assuming bounded local geometry. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers. We also show that the minimum number of simplices in a PL triangulation of $(4k-1)$-manifolds with a fixed simple homotopy type is unbounded if the fundamental group has nontrivial torsion. The proof of our main results builds on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over the simplicial classifying spaces of groups.</description>
