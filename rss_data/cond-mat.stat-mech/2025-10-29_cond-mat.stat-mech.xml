      <title>Free-Fermion Measurement-Induced Volume- to Area-Law Entanglement Transition in the Presence of Fermion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point.</description>

      <title>Group word dynamics from local random matrix Hamiltonians and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one dimensional quantum spin chains whose nearest neighbor interactions are random matrices that square to one. By employing free probability theory, we establish a mapping from the many-body quantum dynamics of energy density in the original chain to a single-particle hopping dynamics when the local Hilbert space dimension is large. The hopping occurs on the Cayley graph of an infinite Coxeter reflection group. Adjacency matrices on large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability. Our results put into contact ideas in free probability theory, quantum mechanics of hyperbolic lattices, and the physics of both generic and integrable Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>On distinguishability among cell-division models based on population and single-cell-level distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the different cell-division models, such as Timer, Sizer, and Adder, can be distinguished based on the correlations between different single-cell-level quantities such as birth-size, division-time, division-size, and division-added-size. Here, we show that other statistical properties of these quantities can also be used to distinguish between them. Additionally, the statistical relationships and different correlation patterns can also differentiate between the different types of single-cell growth, such as linear and exponential. Further, we demonstrate that various population-level distributions, such as age, size, and added-size distributions, are indistinguishable across different models of cell division despite them having different division rules and correlation patterns. Moreover, this indistinguishability is robust to stochasticity in growth rate and holds for both exponential and linear growth. Finally, we show that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by simulations and supported by existing single-cell experimental data.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of Direct Higher-Order Formulations in Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines, including quantum annealing machines, are promising next-generation computers for combinatorial optimization problems. However, due to hardware limitations, most Ising-type hardware can only solve objective functions expressed in linear or quadratic terms of binary variables. Therefore, problems with higher-order terms require an order-reduction process, which increases the number of variables and constraints and may degrade solution quality. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of directly solving such problems without order reduction by using a high-performance simulated annealing-based optimization solver capable of handling polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) formulations. We compare its performance against a conventional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solver on the same hardware platform. As benchmarks, we use the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem and the vehicle routing problem with distance balancing, both of which naturally include higher-order interactions. Results show that the PUBO solver consistently achieves superior solution quality and stability compared to its QUBO counterpart, while maintaining comparable computational time and requiring no order-reduction compilation indicating potential advantages of directly handling higher-order terms in practical optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical typicality in classical lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering deterministic classical lattice systems with continuous variables, we show that, if the initial conditions are sampled according to a probability distribution in which the dynamical variables are statistically independent, the dynamical trajectory of any macroscopic observable is approximately the same for the vast majority of the states in the sample. Our proof relies on general concentration of measure results which provide tight bounds for the deviation from typical behavior in the case of large system sizes. The only condition that we assume for the dynamics is that the influence of a local perturbation in the initial state decays sufficiently fast with distance at any finite time. Our results are relevant, in particular, to classical Hamiltonian systems on a lattice. We apply our general results to a system of coupled rotors with long-range interactions, and report dynamical simulations which verify our findings.</description>

      <title>Accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effect for operators in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent this problem by defining a \textit{dressed} distance between operators that decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case, only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal, non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of significant interest.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</description>

      <title>Exact nematic and mixed magnetic phases driven by competing orders on the pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets are a paradigmatic example of three-dimensional frustrated systems and provide an excellent platform for studying a variety of exotic many-body phenomena, including spin liquids, nematic phases, fragmentation, and order by disorder. In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to bilinear spin models on this lattice, where multiple magnetic phases can be degenerate in energy, often stabilizing unconventional magnetic states. In this work, we focus on one such model, parametrized by the interaction coupling $J_{z\pm}$, which defines a line in parameter space corresponding to the phase boundary between three distinct magnetic phases. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that this model exhibits an order-by-disorder mechanism at low temperatures, giving rise to a \emph{mixed} magnetic phase. This represents the first realization of a $\mathbf{q}=0$ long-range-ordered phase in a pyrochlore magnet characterized by two distinct order parameters, which we denote as the $A_2 \oplus \psi_2$ phase. Furthermore, at $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, the model acquires a subextensive number of discrete symmetries, which preclude the stabilization of conventional long-range order and instead lead to the emergence of a novel nematic phase. We characterize this nematic phase, describe how its ground-state configurations are constructed, and analyze its stability at higher temperatures and under small deviations from $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different forms of the tetrahedron equation appear when all possible ways to label the scattering process of infinitely long straight lines are considered in three dimensional spacetime. This is expected to lead to three dimensional integrability, analogous to the Yang-Baxter equation. Among the three possibilities, we consider two of them and their variants. We show that Clifford algebras solve both the constant and the spectral parameter dependent versions of all of them. We also present a scheme for canonically solving higher simplex equations using tetrahedron solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting order, to be realized in a 2d ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary symmetry principles. This interaction allow us to formulate a duality, similar to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory Skyrmion and vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge field. The static interaction potential is attractive for a Skyrmion and a vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Learning to generalize in evolution through annealed population heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes. The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions.
  Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</description>

      <title>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24713v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</description>

Abstract: Many driven systems alternate between bursts of activity and quiescence and can become trapped in an absorbing state, such as complete inactivity in reaction-diffusion processes or extinction in predator-prey dynamics. It is generally assumed that, conditioned on survival, their long-lived (quasi-stationary) behavior is unique and independent of the initial condition. We show this need not hold, even for memoryless Markov dynamics. When the configuration space fractures into multiple macroscopic communicating classes, where configurations can be reach from one another within a class but not across classes, the system retains a measurable memory of its preparation, which can directly affect the critical exponents near absorbing transitions. Using a minimal birth-death-diffusion model, we demonstrate that the quasi-stationary state is unique when birth processes are present, but becomes nonunique and initial-condition dependent when they are suppressed. This mechanism, arising from vanishing of inter-class escape-rate ratios in thermodynamic limit, challenges the conventional universality hypothesis and suggests possibility of history-dependent critical scaling in controlled lattice or colloidal systems with tunable particle-number.</description>

      <title>Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this Letter that there are, in fact, \textit{two} distinct critical antiferromagnetic phases, where the roles of the local dimer field and its dual field are interchanged: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase near the Heisenberg point $J_2 = 0$, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is gapless and part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase which appears at sufficiently large ferromagnetic $J_2$, where the dimer field is gapped out and its \textit{dual} field -- the instanton density of the $O(3)$ N\'eel field -- is critical instead. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We support these predictions with density matrix renormalisation group calculations.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of the free energy of mixed quantum-classical systems: coupling classical and electronic density functional theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11821v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations, the two major ones being: i) the definition of the QM and MM regions as well as the description of their coupling, and ii) the choice of the methods and levels of approximation made to describe each region. This paper addresses the second point and develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation. We establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start by recalling the expression of the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a mixed system made of Nqm quantum and Nmm classical particles. Then, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full, non-equilibrium, QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities.This paper generalizes both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) to QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional to make the standard eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals explicitly appear, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes. An extension to the semi-grand canonical ensemble, where the number of classical particles is allowed to fluctuate, is provided in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>A simpler probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in closed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Axiomatic Formulation and Foundation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which unifies reversible dynamics described by the Nambu bracket and irreversible processes driven by entropy gradients. The formulation provides a covariant description of systems far from equilibrium, where entropy may transiently decrease as a result of reversible circulations or exchanges with the surroundings, extending the applicability of conventional thermodynamic formalisms.
  As an illustrative example, a triangular chemical reaction system is analyzed. It is shown that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric structures that behave as conserved quantities in the reversible limit naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified and covariant formulation for describing both cyclic dynamics and dissipative processes within a single theoretical structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>The Topology of Rayleigh-Levy Flights in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rayleigh-L\'evy flights are simplified cosmological tools which capture certain essential statistical properties of the cosmic density field, including hierarchical structures in higher-order correlations, making them a valuable reference for studying the highly non-linear regime of structure formation. Unlike standard Markovian processes, they exhibit long-range correlations at all orders. Following on recent work on one dimensional flights, this study explores the one-point statistics and Minkowski functionals (density PDF, perimeter, Euler characteristic) of Rayleigh-L\'evy flights in two dimensions. We derive the Euler characteristic in the mean field approximation and the density PDF and iso-field perimeter $W_{1}$ in beyond mean field calculations, and validate the results against simulations. The match is excellent throughout, even for fields with large variances, in particular when finite volume effects in the simulations are taken into account and when the calculation is extended beyond the mean field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption modeling and analysis through an integrated workflow, which includes isotherm fitting, estimation of the enthalpy of adsorption, prediction of mixture behavior, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM supports 13 isotherm models for isotherm fitting and includes the implementation of Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) (FastIAS) and extended Langmuir models for predicting mixture isotherms. Moreover, the isotherm models can be used to run non-isothermal breakthrough simulations along with isosteric enthalpies of adsorption from the Clausius-Clapeyron and Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners. We compared the breakthrough simulation results from the AIM workflow and compared that with the experimental data in the literature for a ternary gas mixture (CO2/H2/N2) and found excellent agreement for outlet compositions and temperature profiles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations in three-dimensional chiral active fluids by using a simple model of helical self-propelled particles. Helical motion is generated by a constant angular velocity (or chiral torque) acting on the self-propelled force. The chiral torque is assumed to have the same direction and magnitude for all particles. Due to the helical nature of the particle motion, the system is generically anisotropic even when it is spatially homogeneous. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the helicity induces an anisotropic pattern and a singularity in the static structure factor (the density correlation function in Fourier space) in the low-wavenumber limit. Moreover, the system in the limit of infinite persistence time exhibits hyperuniformity in the direction perpendicular to the chiral torque, while giant density fluctuations emerge along the parallel direction. We then construct a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for the system to describe the singular behavior. A linear analysis of the resulting equations yields an analytical expression for the static structure factor, which qualitatively agrees with our numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heralding and Optimal Decoders for Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a statistical mechanics model for fixed-point non-Abelian TOs with perfect measurements under any noise model, which yields the optimal threshold conditioned on measuring anyon syndromes. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find a conditioned optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.</description>
