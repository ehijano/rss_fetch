      <title>Evolution of Generic Varying-Tension Cosmic Strings in Expanding Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been realised that strings with time-dependent tensions exhibit interesting dynamics; in particular, when the tension decreases loops of string can grow and possibly percolate. We extend previous analytic studies of strings with time-dependent tensions to numerical studies of non-circular loops. We show that the dynamics of a varying-tension string in expanding universe is mathematically equivalent to the evolution of a fixed-tension string in a universe with a modified scale factor. We use numerical solvers and machine learning techniques to explore the dynamics of non-circular string loops with radii close to the Hubble scale.</description>

      <title>Integral constraints for $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills from a squashed sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric localization and Ward identities have been used in the past several years to derive two integral constraints on the four-point function of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. These constraints are powerful tools for studying the theory, especially when used in tandem with analytic and/or numerical bootstrap techniques. In this paper, we consider three additional integral constraints that can be derived starting from the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory placed on a squashed four-sphere. These constraints are technically much more challenging to derive than the ones in the literature, and much of the paper is devoted to developing techniques to make this computation tractable. Our end result is that these three constraints are implied by the two constraints already appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining in time, emergent temperature in 2d CFT at large central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the monodromy method, a compact expression is obtained for the identity block contribution to the expectation value of two low-energy probe operators on a broad class of time-dependent heavy pure states in large-$c$ 2d CFTs. It will be shown that the size of the compact spatial dimension sets a coarse-graining time-scale above which the thermal two-point function naturally emerges. A phenomena will be highlighted where the information of the pure state appears to get projected down to a single conformal representation. We will see that this projection is corroborated by known conformal bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models and holographic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare different limits of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ complex fermion with $p$-fermion interactions. First, we compute the fermion Green's function and free energy in the limit of large $N$ followed subsequently by the limit of large $p$. Next, we examine the `double-scaling' limit in which the large $N,p$ limits are taken at fixed $\lambda = p^2/N$. Earlier results on the latter limit are resummed for small $\lambda$, and shown to match our results for the first limit. We also describe the holographic match of our results to two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an additional $U(1)$ gauge field.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops on the Coulomb branch of $N=4$ super-Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Wilson loops on the Coulomb branch of $N = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, by solving for minimal surfaces that connect the contour on the boundary with the D3-brane in the bulk of AdS$_5 \times S^5$. The circular loop undergoes the Gross-Ooguri transition as a function of the radius and angular separation, and we fully map its phase diagram. As a byproduct we find evidence that the expectation value of the straight line is tree-level exact.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the parity-odd part of the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions in a background gravitational field. We start from a manifestly real form of the Lagrangian (that is, not only real up to a total derivative), and we regularize it by means of Pauli-Villars fermions. All parity-odd terms in the anomaly cancel in the integrand, so that the result of the anomaly is necessarily parity-even.</description>

      <title>Various phase transitions in a holographic p-wave superfluid model with nonlinear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates various phase transitions, including those of 2nd, 1st, and 0th order, in a holographic p-wave superfluid model incorporating 4th- and 6th-order nonlinear terms with coefficients $\lambda$ and $\tau$. We demonstrate that these nonlinear terms provide universal control over the phase transitions of the p-wave model, qualitatively consistent with findings in the holographic s-wave case. By analyzing the condensate and free energy behavior across typical phase transitions, we quantitatively map out the $\lambda-\tau$ parameter space that characterizes different transition types. For a slightly negative $\lambda$, we further establish a $\tau-\rho$ phase diagram featuring a line of first-order phase transition points that terminates at a critical point, beyond which lies a supercritical region. Our results confirm the precise tunability of the p-wave superfluid phase transitions through $\lambda$ and $\tau$. The comprehensive phase diagrams and quantitative transition criteria we provide offer a valuable resource for future studies.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall formation from $Z_2$ spontaneous symmetry breaking/restoration in Scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study offers a detailed analysis of domain wall formation and its cosmological consequences in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity coupled to a scalar field. A central aspect of the model is the scalar field Lagrangian's ability to spontaneously break and restore its $Z_2$ discrete symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental prerequisite for topological defect formation. In this context, domain walls arise as kink-like, solitonic solutions that interpolate between the distinct vacuum states of the theory. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamics of a neutral scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, exploring its behavior across different cosmological backgrounds. Our results show that coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term enables the formation of static domain walls with a fixed proper distance within a de Sitter (inflationary) background. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a radiation-dominated epoch, where we identify that the cosmic expansion causes the "melting" of these domain walls. To assess the potential observational signatures of this scenario, we calculate the predicted spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves generated by the network dynamics using {\it CosmoLattice} package. We also examine the possible generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) associated with collapsing domain walls. Regrettably, our calculations indicate that the direct observational detection of such domain walls from this model lies beyond the reach of foreseeable experiments. Our results constitute a No-Go argument against the generation of PBHs as well as of large amplitude GW signals from domain walls in a Scalar-EGB spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism.</description>

      <title>4d/3d reduction of dualities with O6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theories with a pair of two-index tensors interacting through a quartic superpotential, in addition to fundamentals and antifundamentals. The models have a brane engineering in terms of NS, D4, D6 branes and an O6 plane. Depending on the representation of the tensorial matter we have either an O6$^{+}$ plane, an O6$^{-}$ plane or a combined state of O6$^{+}$ and O6$^{-}$, with the addition of 8 semi-infinite half-D6 branes, where the last case realizes a chiral theory. The 4d IR duality is realized through an HW transition in the brane description. Here we study the circle reduction of these dualities from the brane perspective by T-dualizing along the compact direction. We then compare the results against the one obtained from field theoretical considerations and from localization, finding a precise agreement. When we consider the reduction of the 4d superconformal index to the 3d squashed three sphere partition function we observe that it is not always possible to obtain convergent 3d result with the standard reduction prescription, and that the double scaling limit is necessary.</description>

      <title>Superconformal interfaces from 5D N=4 gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a large class of new supersymmetric Janus solutions from five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to five vector multiplets with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. The gauged supergravity admits four supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua, two $N=4$ with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetric $AdS_5$ vacua and two $N=2$ with $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetric ones. In a truncation to three vector multiplets, the gauge group is given by $SO(2)\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$, and the resulting gauged supergravity admits only two $N=4$ supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua with $SO(2)\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)\times SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ residual symmetries. By considering the $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant sector within this truncation, we find a number of supersymetric Janus interfaces between the two $N=4$ vacua on both sides as well as an RG-flow interface between $SO(2)\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)\times SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetric vacua on each side. By repeating the analysis in the full $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauged supergravity, we find Janus solutions interpolating between the aforementioned four supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua as well as examples of multi-Janus interfaces between these vacua.</description>

      <title>Twisting the Hagedorn temperature in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at finite temperature with chemical potentials that couple either to the $R$-charges or the spins of the operators. We find expressions for the Hagedorn temperatures at both zero coupling by explicitly counting states, and at strong coupling using the string theory dual. We then apply the quantum spectral curve (QSC) to this problem, which adds additional twists to the $Q$-functions. For a single chemical potential $\mu$ coupled to one of the $R$-charges, we find the analytic weak-coupling Hagedorn temperature to one-loop order for any value of $\mu$, and to two-loop order for $\mu=1/2$. We then solve the QSC numerically, showing that at strong coupling there is good agreement with the string theory prediction to order $1/\lambda^{1/4}$. This provides further evidence for a recent conjecture of Harmark for the form of the world-sheet zero-point shift. We also use the QSC to find the analytic one-loop correction to the Hagedorn temperature with non-zero chemical potentials coupled to the spins.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction and Landau Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that Feynman integral reduction is controlled by solutions of the Landau equations. We study integral relations with prescribed propagator powers using syzygy methods and discuss how syzygies can be expressed as a sum over components of the Landau singularity locus. This leads to a determinantal approach to solving the syzygy problem, giving rise to highly compact and physically transparent solutions. We demonstrate the method in applications to planar two-loop five-point integrals relevant for the $pp \rightarrow t\overline{t}H$ process. Our results suggest an efficient method of Feynman integral reduction and provide a novel physical perspective on the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional massless celestial amplitudes are distributional and fail to realize the celestial OPE -- most sharply in the non-MHV paradox, where OPEs predict nonzero celestial amplitudes with helicities $-{+}{+}+$ that are known to vanish at tree level. To resolve this, we introduce regular celestial amplitudes. We demonstrate that at tree-level, these amplitudes are non-distributional and, crucially, consistent with the celestial OPE. This suggests a revised dictionary: CCFT correlators are the regular, not conventional, celestial amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make use of the improved K-matrix algorithm to obtain unitarized amplitudes in $R+\alpha R^2$ gravity (the so-called
  Starobisnsky model, of cosmological relevance). The procedure is of some complexity because infrared divergences
  are present and need to be properly regulated. We focus on the behaviour of a bona fide scalar resonance, known to
  exist in this model, and compare it to an apparent resonance detected in previous studies, thus confirming
  that the latter seems to be an artifact due to the introduction of the infrared regulator. We analyze the existence of other
  dynamical resonances and dwell on the amplitudes made unitary by this procedure.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.</description>

      <title>CoLoRFulNNLO for hadron collisions: regularizing initial-state double real emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We provide explicit momentum mappings and the complete set of double-real counterterms required for this class of processes. The counterterms are systematically derived from the known infrared limit formulae of QCD matrix elements, and particular care has been taken to ensure their analytic integrability. The resulting construction involves a relatively small number of counter-events, preserving the locality and efficiency of the scheme. All formulae have been implemented within the publicly available NNLOCAL Monte Carlo program, and we explicitly validate all IR limits using arbitrary-precision computer algebra and present representative results. The counterterms presented here constitute a self-contained subset applicable to general hadronic processes within the CoLoRFulNNLO approach.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of deformed extremal horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that extremal black holes can act as amplifiers of new physics, due to horizon instabilities that enhance the effects of ultraviolet corrections. In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose process in Kerr-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, references [1,2] found that the repetitive Penrose process cannot extract all the extractable rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and reference [3] found that the repetitive electric Penrose process cannot extract all the electrical energy of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first certificate of the gauge-independent bubble nucleation at the electroweak phase transition with the standard model effective field theory. Taking advantage of the thermal effective field theory framework, with the power counting $\lambda \sim g^3$, we rigorously demonstrate the gauge independence of the bubble nucleation rate up to two-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of relevant phase transition parameters on the gauge parameter and investigate its implications for gravitational waves generated by the electroweak phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the calculation of the inclusive jet function for highly energetic heavy quarks at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ using boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). This jet function describes the effect of collinear radiation emitted by energetic heavy quarks on observables dependent on the jet invariant mass $M$. In particular, we focus on the regime $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, which is relevant for boosted top quark production at high-energy colliders in the resonance region. Our results are consistent with non-Abelian exponentiation and reproduce the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions up to three loops. We also verify that the $n_\ell^2 \alpha_s^3$ contribution, with $n_\ell$ denoting the number of light quark flavors, agrees with predictions from renormalon calculus. This calculation completes the list of ingredients required for the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution, an essential component for calibrating the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. It likewise contributes to the invariant-mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks, enabling precise mass determinations at future lepton colliders. Finally, we determine the relation between the pole and two short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and provide an estimate of the non-logarithmic part of the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithm for the diagonalization of the Integration-by-Parts (IBP) equations. Diagonalized IBP equations are indispensable for reducing loop integrals with high numerator powers to master integrals and for solving IBP identities in closed analytic form. A prime example is provided by multivariate Mellin representations of loop amplitudes and cross sections. The extension of these methods to other multivariate recurrence relations is also discussed. As a by-product of our diagonalization procedure, we show how the IBP equations can be cast into an efficient, fully triangular form that is well suited for computer implementation. Several complicated topologies have been computed.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Quantum Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions originating from vacuum fluctuations of mediator fields. Such forces inevitably arise between ordinary matter particles whenever they couple to light mediator species. Conventional computations of quantum forces rely on evaluating one-loop Feynman diagrams of the relevant scattering processes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to compute quantum forces. Instead of relying on perturbative scattering amplitudes, we directly evaluate the quantum fluctuations of the mediator field by solving its quantized equation of motion with appropriate boundary conditions. This approach remains valid beyond the Born approximation and thus applies to regimes of strong coupling between the mediator and matter fields. In the weak-coupling limit, our results reproduce the known expressions from the Feynman diagram approach. In the strong-coupling regime, the result is modified by a factor that can suppress or enhance the effect. In contrast to classical forces, quantum forces intrinsically violate the superposition principle. Our approach may therefore offer a useful tool for probing non-perturbative effects in the infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>Reformulation and Extension of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classically equivalent reformulation of the Standard Model. In this framework, the Higgs doublet is recast as a $2\times2$ matrix and right-handed fermion singlets are organized into novel doublets. This restructuring reveals a latent algebraic geometry that naturally realizes a new local gauge principle: the \textbf{extended Weyl symmetry}. Generalizing Hermann Weyl's 1929 idea of local scale invariance to internal multiplet spaces, this symmetry extends the scope of local gauge symmetries beyond the conventional Yang--Mills framework and provides the foundation for a classical extension of the Standard Model. The resulting theory introduces new gauge bosons (potential dark matter candidates) and a second scalar field. Weyl symmetry breaking renders this additional scalar non-dynamical and leaves the observed Higgs boson as the sole dynamical scalar. The extended Weyl symmetry also leads to several notable theoretical consequences: (i) parity violation is embedded within an underlying parity-symmetric structure; (ii) the minus sign of the Higgs potential is uniquely fixed by the symmetry breaking pattern rather than chosen \textit{by hand}; and (iii) a right-handed neutrino is required by the doublet structure, with its masslessness protected by the extended Weyl symmetry. Quantum aspects of this framework -- particularly potential gauge anomalies and renormalizability -- remain open and warrant dedicated investigation.</description>

      <title>Full universal enveloping vertex algebras from factorisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a systematic construction of the symmetries, or observables in the vacuum sector, of a full conformal field theory on an arbitrary real two-dimensional conformal manifold $\Sigma$. Specifically, we construct a prefactorisation algebra on $\Sigma$ which locally encodes the full (non-chiral) version $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{a},\alpha} = \mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak{a},\alpha} \otimes \bar{\mathbb{V}}^{\mathfrak{a},\alpha}$ of a universal enveloping vertex algebra $\mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak a,\alpha}$, where $\mathfrak a$ is a finite-dimensional vector space labelling the set of fields and $\alpha$ is a $2$-cocycle controlling the central extension of their Lie brackets. Our construction provides a unified treatment of the three canonical examples of (full) universal enveloping vertex algebras - Kac-Moody, Virasoro and $\beta\gamma$ system - using the notion of unital local Lie algebra. By using the coordinate-invariant nature of prefactorisation algebras we derive an analogue of Huang's change of variable formula for full vertex algebras. We give a careful treatment of (both Euclidean and Lorentzian) reality conditions in this formalism which allows us, in the Kac-Moody and Virasoro cases, to construct a Hermitian sesquilinear form on these full vertex algebras by using the factorisation product to the global observables on $S^2$. We also give an explicit derivation of Borcherds type identities and a construction of the operator formalism for $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak a,\alpha}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion in a small cosmological constant, we compute leading, subleading and sub-subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude for the tree-level scatterings in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in [JHEP10(2023)055] for the soft photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. By utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, alongside Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loops in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of B-branes in a class of nonabelian GLSMs realizing the canonical line bundle $K_{Gr(2,N)}$ in their geometric phase. By analysing the hemisphere partition function, i.e. B-brane central charge, we propose a grade restriction rule and the corresponding window categories for a specific class of paths between phases. We find very striking differences between the cases of N even and N odd. In particular, for the case of N even, we suggest that more than one window category can be possible, for a fixed path. A detailed computation of the open Witten index and some monodromies provides evidence for our proposal for window categories. In addition, we make some remarks about B-branes on the the strongly coupled phase, for the case $N=4$, based on our window proposal.</description>

Abstract: The canonical quantization of a field theory for spin-$1/2$ massive bosons that satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation is presented. The breakdown of the usual spin-statistics connection is due to the redefinition of the dual field, rendering the theory pseudo-Hermitian. The normal-ordered Hamiltonian is bounded from below with real eigenvalues, and the theory is consistent with microcausality and invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Seiberg-like duality of adjoint SQCD(Kim-Park duality) with linear monopole superpotential terms which encompasses known monopole deformed Kim-Park dualities. Equipped with this, we classify all the monopole deformed Kim--Park dualities up to quadratic powers of monopole deformations, and find all are equivalent either to the original Kim--Park, or to the proposed duality. With the recently developed deconfined perspective, this means all the working monopole deformed Kim--Park dualities up to quadratic terms are assembled by the Aharony and Benini-Benvenuti-Pasquetti dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature, we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then examine how these corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical backreaction and find that their sign depends on the initial conditions. In order to place our results in context, we compare them to the corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant derived in [1].</description>

Abstract: We explore consistent truncations from 10d/11d supergravity to supergravity theories on brane worldvolumes. Supersymmetric black-brane solutions to these lower-dimensional theories can be uplifted to 10d/11d supergravity and interpreted as intersecting-brane solutions with a particular smearing pattern. We survey this novel family of intersecting-brane solutions which also includes cases that are not related to previously known consistent truncations. Turning the argument on its head, we argue that the knowledge of such solutions allows us to generate appropriate embedding ans\"atze for consistent truncations. We demonstrate this by deriving new consistent embeddings of pure 5d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity on D4-branes in type IIA theory and of pure 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity on NS5-branes in type IIB theory.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.</description>

      <title>Bounding field excursions along null geodesics with applications to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua, and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.</description>

      <title>Kosmic Field Theories: Towards Holographic Duals for Unitary String Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on cosmological amplitudes has established reality conditions (derived from unitarity) for general particle-creation processes in flat FLRW cosmologies, in the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. In light of these results, we propose a new class of large-$N$ holographic gauge theories with $d$ spatial dimensions, which we call Kosmic Field Theories (KFTs), of which only a subset are conformal (KCFTs). By imposing an appropriate -- $d$ dependent -- complex phase for the number of colours $N$ and the t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$, we show that the complex phases of $n$-point functions in a KFT match the reality conditions required by $d + 1$ bulk unitarity, to all orders in bulk and boundary perturbation theory, including loop diagrams. Since $N^2/\lambda$ is imaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap with the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary investigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\pm$ sign of $N^2$ and $\lambda$.
  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real dimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is odd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented and/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of freedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$ expansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Connections Between Krylov and Nielsen Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between Krylov and Nielsen complexity by choosing the Krylov basis to be part of the elementary gate set of Nielsen geometry and selecting a Nielsen complexity metric compatible with the Krylov metric. Up to normalization, the Krylov complexity of a Hermitian operator then equals the length squared of a straight-line trajectory on the manifold of unitaries that connects the identity operator with a precursor operator. The corresponding length provides an upper bound on Nielsen complexity that saturates whenever the straight line is a minimal geodesic. While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.</description>

      <title>Towards six W-boson amplitude at two loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the planar integrand of the six-leg amplitude of massive W-bosons on the special Coulomb branch of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to two-loop order. We use the six-dimensional supersymmetric spinor-helicity formalism and the generalized unitarity-cut sewing technique to perform this analysis. The thus-found expression corresponds in the massless limit to the six-gluon maximally helicity-violating amplitude. The upshot of the current consideration is that the former is just an uplift of the latter from four to six dimensions. This repeats the pattern found earlier for four- and five-leg amplitudes of massive W-bosons.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non-stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer and can differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models at late times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are completing their evaporation process at the present epoch.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass relation from a standard-model boson operator representation in terms of fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields in a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common Higgs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top and bottom quark masses[Phys. Rev. D 99, 073001, 2019]. Using second quantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs field, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of top and bottom quark operators, considering discrete degrees of freedom and chirality. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of composite models. The vacuum expectation value is calculated quantum mechanically, which relates to the common mass-generating scalar operator and it reproduces the vector and quark-doublet masses. This also links the corresponding scalar-vector and Yukawa vertices, and restricts the t- and b-quark masses in a hierarchy relation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, we notice that the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on dynamical vacuum selection in a landscape scanning the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition violation and beyond Horndeski physics in light of DESI DR2 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation and dark energy (DE), both featuring accelerated expansion, are crucial components of modern cosmology. As indicated by singularity theorems, null energy condition (NEC) violation is essential for resolving the initial singularity of inflation. The latest DESI DR2 results show that the DE equation of state evolves from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ at redshift $z \lesssim 1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ today, reinforcing interest in testing NEC violation in the observable Universe. Within a unified effective field theory framework that applies to both inflation and DE, we use DESI DR2 data and a non-parametric reconstruction approach to test, for the first time, the ``beyond Horndeski'' physics known to support fully stable NEC violation in nonsingular cosmology. Therefore, our work provides a novel avenue to constrain the physics underlying NEC violation in a model agnostic way. It also highlights the potential relevance of NEC violation to both the primordial Universe and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Physics case for low-$\sqrt{s}$ QCD studies at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23855</link>

Abstract: Measurements of hadronic final states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Hadronic final states can be studied over a range of hadronic energies $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{had}} \approx 20\mbox{--}80\,\mathrm{GeV}$ by exploiting events with hard initial- and final-state QED radiation (ISR/FSR) during the high-luminosity Z-pole run, as well as in dedicated short (about one month long) $e^{+}e^{-}$ runs at CM energies $\sqrt{s} \approx 40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $60\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Using realistic estimates and fast detector simulations, we show that data samples of about $10^{9}$ hadronic events can be collected at the FCC-ee at each of the low-CM-energy points. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics, complementing data from nominal FCC-ee runs at higher center-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s} \approx 91, 160, 240,$ and $365\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Causal structure and topology change in (2+1)-dimensional simplicial gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for analyzing the causal structure at vertices in (2+1)-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial gravity. By examining the intersection patterns of lightcones emanating from a vertex with its simplicial neighbourhood, we identify 13 distinct causal types of Lorentzian tetrahedra -- excluding configurations with null faces. This classification forms the basis for a topological characterization of the local causal structure in terms of the number of connected regions on the triangulated 2-sphere that are spacelike and timelike separated from a bulk vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular causal configurations and new types of irregular causal configurations, generalizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and `Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.
  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by analyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit configurations. Transitions in `vertex-causality' coincide with discontinuities in the curvature, suggesting discrete topology change. Causally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while vertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities. Interestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally independent. These results have direct implications for discrete quantum gravity approaches where the emergence of semiclassical spacetime depends on how causal structures are encoded within the triangulation.</description>

      <title>Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use a non-parametric analytical model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls - originating in models with an approximate (or biased) discrete symmetry breaking - generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, describes systems in which the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, in contrast to classical hidden-variable descriptions. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that localized interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results show that contextuality is a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum and establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>The 3d mixed BF Lagrangian 1-form: a variational formulation of Hitchin's integrable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of gauged Lagrangian $1$-forms, extending the notion of Lagrangian $1$-forms to the setting of gauge theories. This general formalism is applied to a natural geometric Lagrangian $1$-form on the cotangent bundle of the space of holomorphic structures on a smooth principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ over a compact Riemann surface $C$ of arbitrary genus $g$, with or without marked points, in order to gauge the symmetry group of smooth bundle automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}$. The resulting construction yields a multiform version of the $3$d mixed BF action with so-called type A and B defects, providing a variational formulation of Hitchin's completely integrable system over $C$. By passing to holomorphic local trivialisations and going partially on-shell, we obtain a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. The cases of genus $0$ and $1$ with marked points are treated in greater detail, producing explicit Lagrangian $1$-forms for the rational Gaudin hierarchy and the elliptic Gaudin hierarchy, respectively, with the elliptic spin Calogero-Moser hierarchy arising as a special subcase.</description>

      <title>DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a realization of that idea which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves.</description>
