      <title>Thoracic Fluid Measurements by Bioimpedance: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioimpedance is an extensively studied non-invasive technique with diverse applications in biomedicine. This comprehensive review delves into the foundational concepts, technical intricacies, and practical implementations of bioimpedance. It elucidates the underlying principles governing bioimpedance measurements, including the relevant physics equations employed for estimating body fluid levels. Moreover, a thorough examination of the prevalent single-chip analog front end (AFE) available in the market, such as AD5933, MAX30001, AD5940, and AFE4300, is conducted, shedding light on their specifications and functionalities. The review focuses on using bioimpedance to assess thoracic impedance for heart failure detection by utilizing the relation between lung water and heart failure. Traditional techniques are compared with bioimpedance-based methods, demonstrating the latter's efficacy as a non-invasive tool for cardiac evaluation. In addition, the review addresses the technical limitations and challenges associated with bioimpedance. Pertinent issues such as contact impedance, motion artifacts, calibration, and validation regarding their impact on measurement precision and dependability are thoroughly examined. The review also explores strategies and advancements in using artificial intelligence to mitigate these challenges.</description>

      <title>From Radiation Dose to Cellular Dynamics: A Discrete Model for Simulating Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches have been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach, dating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the survival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider tissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While reasonable for large scale models, e.g., for human organs, any cellular scale effects become, by necessity, neglected. They do, however, influence growth, morphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling the effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological \textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of cells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo procedure into \textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival probability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by phagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were simulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly proliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared to prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good agreement. In addition, we simulated proliferating systems and analyzed the probability density of the contact forces. We determined the state of the system with respect to the jamming transition and found very good agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>VPAL: A novel method to reduce reconstruction time for 5D free-running imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Ferumoxytal-enhanced 5D free-running whole heart CMR provides image quality comparable to CTA, but requires hours-long reconstruction time, preventing clinical usage. This study developed a variable projection augmented Lagrangian (VPAL) method for 5D motion-resolved image reconstruction and compared it with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in five numerical simulations and 15 in-vivo pediatric data set.
  Approach: Relative error of the reconstructed images against the ground-truth images was assessed in numerical simulations. In-vivo analysis compared reconstruction time, mid-short axis (SA) blood-myocardium sharpness, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a radiologist's image quality ratings between VPAL and ADMM. A paired t-test (p&lt;0.05) was used to determine statistical significance, while linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis for agreement assessments.
  Results: VPAL and ADMM had similar relative errors compared to the ground truth, p = 0.07. In in-vivo datasets, VPAL reduced the reconstruction time from 16.3 +/- 3.6 hours (ADMM) to 4.7 +/- 1.1 hours (VPAL), p=1e-10. Blood-myocardium border sharpness in VPAL closely correlates to ADMM , R^2 = 0.97. The LVEFs values measured by VPAL and ADMM reconstructions are largely similar, 56 +/- 6 % in ADMM and 56 +/- 6 % in VPAL, p=0.55. Both VPAL and ADMM reconstructions have good to excellent diagnostic ratings (VPAL vs. ADMM: 3.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.4 in 2-chamber; 3.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- in 4-chamber; 3.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5 in mid-SA reformatted views. Conclusion: VPAL enables faster reconstruction than ADMM while maintaining equivalent image quality for functional assessments, supporting its potential for clinical use.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.</description>
