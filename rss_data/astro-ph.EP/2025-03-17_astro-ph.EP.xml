      <title>LiDO: Exploring the Stable Plutino Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a publicly available, high-resolution, filled-parameter-space synthetic distribution of the Plutinos, trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) librating in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune, with particular focus on the Plutinos simultaneously Kozai-librating. This synthetic distribution was built in preparation for results from the Large inclination Distant Objects (LiDO) Survey, which pointed at locations on the sky where Kozai Plutinos are predicted to come to pericenter and are thus most easily detected in magnitude-limited surveys. Although we do not expect the full stable parameter-space presented here to be populated with real TNOs, it provides a useful starting point for comparison with Neptune migration simulations and debiased observational results. Our new stable parameter space synthetic distribution of fictitious Plutinos is consistent with previous works, and we build on past results by focusing on the behavior of Kozai Plutinos over 4Gyr integrations. We find that 95% of 4Gyr stable Kozai Plutinos remain in the same omega-libration island for the entire integration. This provides an interesting diagnostic opportunity: any asymmetry in the true number of 4Gyr stable Kozai Plutinos in the two omega-libration islands must be caused by the details of emplacement during giant planet migration. Through analysis of previously published Neptune migration models, we show that the intrinsic fraction of Plutinos captured into Kozai depends on Neptune's migration speed and mode. Combining the filled-parameter-space synthetic distribution with future migration simulations and the results of the carefully characterized LiDO survey will enable interpretation of the intrinsic orbital distribution of the Kozai and non-Kozai Plutinos.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Atmospheric Mass Loss and Planet Migration in the Time Evolution of Short-Period Transiting Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative studies of young and old exoplanet populations offer a glimpse into how planets may form and evolve with time. We present an occurrence rate study of short-period ($&lt;$12 days) planets between 1.8--10 Rearth around 1374 FGK stars in nearby (200 pc) young clusters ($&lt;$1 Gyr), utilizing data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. These planets represent a population closer to their primordial state. We find that the occurrence rate of young planets is higher ($64^{+32}_{-22}$%) compared to the Gyr-old population observed by \kepler ($7.98^{+0.37}_{-0.35}$%). Dividing our sample into bins of young (10--100 Myr) and intermediate (100\,Myr--1 Gyr) ages, we also find that the occurrence distribution in orbital period remains unchanged while the distribution in planet radius changes with time. Specifically, the radius distribution steepens with age, indicative of a larger planet population shrinking due to the atmospheric thermal cooling and mass loss. We also find evidence for an increase (1.9$\sigma$) in occurrence after 100 Myr, possibly due to tidal migration driving planets inside of 12 days. While evidence suggests post-disk migration and atmospheric mass loss shape the population of short-period planets, more detections of young planets are needed to improve statistical comparisons with older planets. Detecting long-period young planets and planets $&lt;$1.8 Rearth will help us understand these processes better. Additionally, studying young planetary atmospheres provides insights into planet formation and the efficiency of atmospheric mass loss mechanisms on the evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking long-period resonance chains with stellar flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Planetary migration models predict multiple planets captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances during the disk phase. Over a dozen systems have been observed in these configurations, nearly all close-in planets, with a lack of resonant chains for planets with orbital periods larger than ~300 days. Aims. Dynamical studies often overlook the fact that stars do not evolve in isolation. In this work, we explore the possibility that the absence of giant planets in long-period resonant chains may be due to post-formation disruption caused by stellar flybys. Methods. For planets in the 2:1-2:1 and 3:2-3:2 resonant chains, we evaluate the long-term stability after varying parameters such as the planet masses, as well as the inclination, pericentric distance, and mass of the flyby star. Results. Our integrations show that the 2:1-2:1 resonant chain is significantly more resilient to a stellar flyby than for the 3:2-3:2 configuration. The nature of the instability is different in both scenarios, the 2:1-2:1 becomes unstable quickly, soon after a penetrative close encounter. Instead, planets in the 3:2-3:2 chain become unstable in long timescales due to more distant flybys (up to q/a_out ~ 25 for Jupiter-mass planets) that only provide small perturbations for the system to chaotically dissolve. Conclusions. If an encounter occurs between a star hosting planets and a passing star, Jupiter-mass systems with 3 planets in a 3:2-3:2 resonant chain or more compact initial configurations are likely to be disrupted.</description>

      <title>Dust Clumping in Outer Protoplanetary Disks: the Interplay Among Four Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.</description>

      <title>NH-rich organic compounds from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu: nanoscale spectral and isotopic characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of spectral bands at 3.06 um by MicrOmega, combined with the chemical identification of other NH-containing organic molecules in Ryugu samples, suggests the presence of potential NH-bearing compounds. However, the chemical forms of these NH-rich compounds, whether associated with N-rich organics, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4 or NH-organics-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms, remain to be better understood. In this study, we report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using multi-scale infrared (mm-reflectance, micro-FTIR, and nano-AFM-IR) and NanoSIMS techniques to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components in the Ryugu asteroid. Our findings show that Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare, micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (mainly due to C=O stretching of the amide I band) and 1550 cm-1 (mainly due to N-H bending vibration mode of the amide II band), indicative of amide-related compounds. In contrast, these compounds are absent in C0050. Notably, nitrogen isotopic analysis reveals that these amides in C0052 are depleted in 15N (d15N = -215 +/- 92 permil), confirming their indigenous origin, while carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions are indistinguishable from terrestrial values within errors (d13C = -22 +/- 52 and dD = 194 +/- 368 permil). The amides detected in C0052 could have formed through hydrothermal alteration from carboxylic acids and amines precursors on the Ryugu's parent planetesimal. Alternatively, they could have originated from the irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice by UV light or galactic cosmic rays, either at the surface of the asteroid in the outer Solar System or on mantle of interstellar dust grains in the interstellar medium. Amides delivered to early Earth by primitive small bodies, such as asteroid Ryugu, may have played a crucial role in prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Constraints on the Stellar and Planetary Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass function (MF) of isolated objects measured by microlensing consists of both a stellar and a planetary component. We compare the microlensing MFs of Gould et al (2022) and Sumi et al (2023) to other measurements of the MF. The abundance of brown dwarfs in the Sumi et al (2023) stellar MF is consistent with measurements from the local solar neighborhood (Kirkpatrick et al 2024). Microlensing free-floating planets ($\mu$FFPs) may may be free-floating or orbit host stars with semimajor axes $a\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{au}$ and therefore can constrain the populations of both free-floating planetary-mass objects and wide-orbit planets. Comparisons to radial velocity and direct imaging planet populations suggest that either most of the $\mu$FFP population with masses $&gt;1~M_{\rm Jup}$ is bound to hosts more massive than M dwarfs or some fraction of the observed bound population actually comes from the low-mass tail of the stellar population. The $\mu$FFP population also places strong constraints on planets inferred from debris disks and gaps in protoplanetary disks observed by ALMA.</description>

      <title>Investigating the formation and growth of Titan's atmospheric aerosols using an experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan has a climate system with similarities to Earth, including the presence of a thick atmosphere made up of several atmospheric layers. As on Earth, Titan's climate is influenced by several factors: the gaseous species making up the atmosphere, the energy deposited on the satellite, and solid organic aerosols. Indeed, numerous observations have revealed the presence of solid particles in the form of an opaque orange haze in Titan's atmosphere, influencing radiation balance and atmospheric dynamics, for example. However, the influence of these suspended solid particles seems to evolve according to the atmospheric altitude where they are located, certainly testifying to the presence of organic solids with different physico-chemical properties. At present, it is suspected that several populations/classes of atmospheric aerosols may form following different chemical pathways, and that aerosols undergo growth processes that modify their properties. We propose the calculation of an uptake coefficient between six neutral gaseous products (C2H2, HCN, C2H6, C2H3N, HC3N, C2N2) and the surface of the Titan aerosol analogues produced in this study.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170\,000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several Gaia DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 20 best candidates of which two are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. The companion around the Sun-like star G\,15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>Spin and Obliquity Evolution of Hot Jupiter Hosts from Resonance Locks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars typically have smaller obliquities, which may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$). Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ($-2 \leq m \leq 2$). Stars spin up for $m &gt; 0$, and spin down for $m &lt; 0$. We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$-values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation. The possible suppression of resonance locking by non-linear dissipation of gravity waves remains an outstanding issue.</description>
