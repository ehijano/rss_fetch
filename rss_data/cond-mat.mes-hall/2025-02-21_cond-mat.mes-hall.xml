      <title>Dynamical Confinement and Magnetic Traps for Charges and Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Indexing current-voltage characteristics using a hash function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiating between devices of the same size is essential for ensuring their reliability. However, identifying subtle differences can be challenging, particularly when the devices share similar characteristics, such as transistors on a wafer. To address this issue, we propose an indexing method for current-voltage characteristics that assigns proximity numbers to similar devices. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to Coulomb blockade phenomena observed in PMOSFETs and nanowire transistors. In this approach, lengthy data on current characteristics are replaced with hashed IDs, facilitating identification of individual devices, and streamlining the management of a large number of devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ Tunneling Contact for 2D Transition-metal Dichalcogenides Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based transistors has been constrained by high contact resistance and inadequate current delivery, primarily stemming from metal-induced gap states and Fermi level pinning. Research into addressing these challenges is essential for the advancing 2D transistors from laboratory experiments to industrial-grade production. In this work, we present amorphous Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a novel tunneling contact layer for multilayer WS2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) to enhance electrical performance. The addition of this innovative tunneling layer avoid Schottky barrier forming while finally change into a tunneling barrier with the barrier height to just 3.7 meV, near-ideal ohmic contacts. This approach effectively reduces contact resistance to only 2.38 k$\Omega\,\mu$m and specific contact resistivity as low as $3 \times 10^{-5}$ $\Omega$cm$^2$. A record-high electron mobility of 296 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and ON-OFF ratio over 106 are realized for WS$_2$ transistor at room temperature. Compared to other tunneling materials, ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ layer offers scalability, cost-efficient production and broad substrate compatibility, making it well-suited for seamless integration with industrial wafer-scale electronics. A robust device performance remains highly consistent in a large-scale transistor array fabricated on $1.5\times 1.5$ cm$^2$ chips, with the average mobility closing to 200 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. These findings establish a new benchmark for contact performance in 2D transistors and prove the potential of tunneling contact engineering in advancing high-performance, scalable 29 pelectronics with promising applications in quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetism in Honeycomb Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital magnetic susceptibility of the tight-binding model for the honeycomb ladder with the additional vertical hopping. Despite being one-dimensional, the magnetic flux penetrating the hexagonal rings affects the energetics of electrons, resulting in the finite orbital magnetic response. We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is sensitive to the parameters as well as the chemical potential. At half-filling, the response is diamagnetic when the system is close to the pure honeycomb ladder, whereas it turns to paramagnetic when it is close to the two-leg ladder. We also find several characteristic properties away from half-filling, such as the diamagnetic response at the band top and bottom, and the large paramagnetic response at the band gap sandwiched by the divergent density of states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Kitaev's real-space formulation of the first Chern number to the second Chern number and establish a computational framework for its evaluation. To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductance at superradiant phase transition in quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a few-body quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this work, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our work can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable few-body phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically driven spin resonances in double quantum dots can lift the spin blockade and give rise to a resonant current. This current can probe the properties of coupled two-spin states for different quantum dot configurations. Using a Floquet-Markov quantum transport model we compute the resonant current for different driving amplitudes and ac field frequencies in spin-orbit coupled quantum dots. We show that the resonant current has a very rich interference pattern which can give valuable insight into the singlet-triplet state mixing.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting and superconducting properties of 2D hexagonal materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beginning of high interest in two-dimensional (2D) crystals is marked by the synthesis of graphene, which constitutes exemplary monolayer material. This is due to the multiple extraordinary properties of graphene, particularly in the field of quantum electronic phenomena. However, there are electronic features that are notably missing in this material due to the inherent nature of its charge carriers. Of particular importance is that pristine graphene does not exhibit semiconducting or superconducting properties, preventing related applications. Certain modifications to graphene or even synthesis of sibling materials is needed to arrive with semiconducting and superconducting 2D hexagonal materials. Here, the representative examples of such materials are discussed in detail along with their expected properties. Special attention is given to the unique semiconducting and superconducting phenomena found in these materials e.g. the non-adiabatic superconductivity, spin- and valley-dependent conductivity or the bulk-like Schottky-type potential barriers. The discussion is supplemented with some pertinent conclusions and perspectives for future work.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect led to the classification of materials as topological insulators, and the generalization of this classification to non-Hermitian band theory is an active area of research. While the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on Weyl Hamiltonians is expected to provide valuable insights for classifying topological phase transitions, predicting the effect of non-Hermiticity on Hall conductivity remains complex. In fact, previous theoretical work has shown that the quantization of Hall conductivity in the quantum anomalous Hall effect is lost, even though it is classified as a non-Hermitian Chern insulator. In this work, the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Superlative spin transport of holes in ultra-thin black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of energy-efficient spin-based hybrid devices that can perform functions such as logic, communication, and storage requires the ability to control and transport highly polarized spin currents over long distances in semiconductors. While traditional semiconductors such as silicon support spin transport, the effects of carrier type and concentration on important spin parameters are not well understood due to the need for extrinsic doping, which can cause additional momentum and hence spin scattering. Two-dimensional semiconductors, on the other hand, offer the ability to tune carrier type and concentration through field effect gating and inherently have long intrinsic spin lifetimes, making them a desirable platform for spin transport. Here, we study gate-tunable spin transport across narrow band-gap black phosphorus-based spin valves which enable us to systematically investigate spin transport with varying hole and electron concentrations under non-local geometry. Our findings demonstrate exceptional pure spin transport that approaches intrinsic limit, particularly in the low hole doping range. We achieved record non-local signals reaching 350 {\Omega} and spin lifetimes exceeding 16 ns. Contrary to the behaviour seen in typical semiconductors, we find that the spin transport performance of holes in black phosphorus is significantly better than that of electrons, with the Elliott-Yafet process being the primary spin scattering mechanism. The observation of gate-tunable nanosecond spin lifetimes and colossal pure spin signals in both p- and n-type black phosphorus offers promising prospects for the development of novel semiconducting spintronics devices requiring sharp p-n interfaces.</description>

      <title>Identification of soft modes in amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ via first-principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <title>Slave-spin approach to the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a strongly interacting quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads using a slave-spin representation of the dot. At the mean-field level the problem maps into a resonant level model with superconducting leads, coupled to an auxiliary spin-1/2 variable accounting for the parity of the dot. We obtain the mean-field phase diagram, showing a transition between a Kondo (singlet) and a local moment (doublet) regime, corresponding to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction. The mean-field theory qualitatively captures the Kondo singlet phase and its competition with superconductivity for weak values of the BCS gap, including the non-trivial dependence of the Andreev bound states on the interaction, but fails in the doublet regime where it predicts a dot decoupled from the bath. Using diagrammatic techniques and a random phase approximation, we include fluctuations on top of the mean-field theory to describe finite-frequency dynamics of the effective spin variable. This leads to the formation of high-energy Hubbard bands in the spectral function and a coherent Kondo peak with a BCS gap at low energies. Finally, we compute the Josephson current and the induced superconducting correlations on the dot.</description>

      <title>Itinerant topological magnons and spin excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides: Mapping electron topology to spin counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.</description>

      <title>Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Tunable Localization of Simultaneous Type I and Type II Band Alignment in a MoSe2/WS2 Heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e heterobilayers exhibiting spatially varying band alignment and electron and hole localization that can be precisely controlled through the twist angle have emerged as exciting platforms for studying complex quantum phenomena. While most heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a type II band alignment, the introduction of type I band alignment could enable stronger light-matter coupling and enhanced radiative emission. Here, we show through a combination of first-principles GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements that contrary to previous understanding, the MoSe2/WS2 heterobilayer has a type I band alignment at large twist angles and simultaneous regions of type I and type II band alignment due to the structural reconstruction in different high symmetry regions at small twist angles. In tr-ARPES, consistent with our calculations, a long-lived electron population is only observed in MoSe2 for samples with large twist angles, while in samples with small twist angles, signals from two distinct long-lived excitons are observed. Moreover, despite the near degeneracy of the conduction bands of the two layers, no excitonic hybridization occurs, suggesting that previously observed absorption peaks in this material arise from lattice reconstruction. Our findings clarify the complex energy landscape in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures, where the coexistence of type I and type II band alignment opens the door to moir\'e-tunable optoelectronic devices with intrinsic lateral heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Fast spin precession and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films improved by Pd buffer layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets take the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets making them promise for spintronic applications. Here we prepared ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films with high Curie temperature and investigated the crystalline structure and magnetic properties affected by the Pd buffer layer. We demonstrated that both crystalline quality and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Mn4N thin films are enhanced significantly due to the relaxation of tensile stress induced by the Pd buffer layer. We also demonstrated a fast spin precession at room temperature, almost 100 GHz, in Mn4N thin films. With the characteristics of high thermal stability, enhanced PMA by buffer layer and fast spin precession, Mn4N thin film is a promising material for spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction in atomistic systems is usually described by the classical Prandtl-Tomlinson model suitable for capturing the dragging force of a nanoparticle in a periodic potential. Here we consider the quantum mechanical version of this model in which the dissipation is facilitated by releasing heat to an external bath reservoir. The time evolution of the system is captured with the Liouville-von Neumann equation through the density matrix of the system in the Markov approximation. We examine several kinetic and dissipative properties of the nanoparticle by delineating classical vs quantum mechanical effects. We find that that the Landau-Zener tunneling is a key factor in the overall reduction of the frictional dissipation when compared to the classical motion in which such tunneling is absent. This in-depth study analyzes the interplay between velocity, strength of interaction, and temperature to control the frictional process and provide useful guidelines for experimental data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations-driven Melting Transitions in Two-dimensional Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are pivotal in driving quantum phase transitions, exemplified by the quantum melting of Wigner crystals into Fermi liquids in electron systems. However, their impact on superconducting systems near zero temperature, particularly in the superconductor-insulator/metal transition, remains poorly understood. In this study, through electric transport measurements on the two-dimensional (2D) superconductor (SnS)1.17NbS2, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations induce vortex displacement from their mean position, leading to the quantum melting of vortex solid near zero temperature. Quantitative analysis reveals the magnetic field-induced anomalous metal originates from this quantum melting transition, with energy dissipation governed by quantum fluctuations-driven vortex displacements. Remarkably, further extending this analysis to various 2D superconductors yields the same results, and many properties of anomalous metal can be qualitatively understood within the framework of quantum melting. The connection between the quantum melting of vortex solids and dissipative anomalous metal opens a novel pathway towards understanding quantum phase transitions through vortex dynamics, providing new insights on both fields.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted tracking of magnetic objects using quantum diamond magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote magnetic sensing can be used to monitor the position of objects in real-time, enabling ground transport monitoring, underground infrastructure mapping and hazardous detection. However, magnetic signals are typically weak and complex, requiring sophisticated physical models to analyze them and a detailed knowledge of the system under study, factors that are frequently unavailable. In this work, we provide a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a Machine Learning (ML) method that can be trained exclusively on experimental data, without the need of any physical model, to predict the position of a magnetic target in real-time. The target can be any object with a magnetic signal above the floor noise, and in this case we use a quantum diamond magnetometer to track variations of few hundreds of nanoteslas produced by an elevator moving along a single axis. The one-dimensional movement is a simple yet challenging scenario, resembling realistic environments such as high buildings, tunnels or train circuits, and is the first step towards building broader applications. Our ML algorithm can be trained in approximately 40 min, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting the target's position at a rate of 10 Hz, for a positional error tolerance of 30 cm, which is a precise distance compared to the 4-meter spacing between parking levels. Our results open up the possibility to apply this ML method more generally for real-time monitoring of magnetic objects, which will broaden the scope of magnetic detection applications.</description>

      <title>Discovery of transient topological crystalline order in optically driven SnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation of quantum materials has opened new frontiers for transiently inducing novel phases of matter, including magnetism, charge density waves, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity beyond the constraints of equilibrium thermodynamics. Triggering a transient topological order in a trivial semiconductor represents a key milestone, as it could provide an on-demand route to topological functionality for device applications. However, achieving a topologically nontrivial phase from a large-gap (~ 1 eV) semiconductor remains a major challenge, as substantial energy modification is required to invert the band gap. Here, we report the discovery of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in a sizable-gap (~ 0.8 eV) layered semiconductor, SnSe, through femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a Dirac-like linear dispersion forming within the band gap on a subpicosecond timescale. This transient state shows hallmark features of a reflection-invariant topological crystalline insulator, including a high Fermi velocity (2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points located away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, persisting for several picoseconds even at room temperature. Our findings establish a nonequilibrium pathway to ultrafast topological order in a semiconductor, opening new avenues for optically driven spintronic and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Passive Demultiplexed Two-photon State Generation from a Quantum Dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Heterostructures of stacked two-dimensional lattices have shown great promise for engineering novel material properties. As an archetypal example of such a system, the hexagon-shared honeycomb-kagome lattice has been experimentally synthesized in various material platforms. In this work, we explore three rotationally symmetric variants of the honeycomb-kagome lattice: the hexagonal, triagonal, and biaxial phases. While the triagonal and biaxial phases exhibit trivial insulating and Dirac semimetal band structures, respectively, the hexagonal phase hosts a higher-order topological phase driven by band inversion near the $\Gamma$-point. This highlights a key distinction from the conventional band inversions at the $K$-point observed in hexagonal homobilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the distinct topological properties of these phases result in network band structures within moir\'e heterostructures formed by twisted or lattice-mismatched HK systems. These network band structures can be experimentally observed through extrinsic twisting or intrinsic lattice mismatching between the honeycomb and kagome systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a model with Weyl magnons and nodal-line magnons ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) in a collinear altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice. Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition to the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the magnon topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon spin Nernst effect when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. We calculate the differential gyromagnetic ratio induced purely by the topology of altermagnetic magnons, which can be probed through the Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect.</description>

Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and discuss the possible superconducting ground states as well as the interplay between superconducting states and magnetic orders. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of robust unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra- and penta-layer graphene in the absence of moir\'e superlattice effects. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne as low as 2.4*1011 cm-2 in three tetralayer and two pentalayer devices. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking (TRSB) due to electron's orbital motion is found, and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including: 1. In the superconducting state, Rxx shows magnetic hysteresis in varying out-of-plane magnetic field B, which is absent from all other superconductors; 2. the superconducting states are immune to in-plane magnetic field and are developed within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal phase; 3. the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B of up to 1.4 Tesla, higher than any graphene superconductivity reported so far and indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close to the BCS-BEC crossover. Our observations establish a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity, and pave the way to explore Majorana modes and topological quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Orbital magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the band topology of bulk crystalline insulators. Typical examples include the half quantized Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion insulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their nontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined only for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects in 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open questions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the spatial gradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that such quantized orbital magnetoelectric response is exact for various types of interlayer hoppings and stackings, and remains robust even against disorder and lack of crystalline symmetries. We argue that the exact quantization has a topological origin and is protected by Chern number. Furthermore, we propose two promising material platforms to observe the proposed quantized orbital magnetoelectric response thanks to recent experimental developments in detecting spatial magnetic-field distributions in device systems.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate that many non-excitonic dielectric and optical properties of semiconductors and insulators caused by interband absorption are originated from quantum geometry, including charge susceptibility, relative dielectric constant, optical conductivity, dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, reflectance, and transmittance. The key to this recognition is the complex optical conductivity, which contains the quantum metric in the optical transition matrix element, and the fact that all these dielectric and optical properties can be expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of optical conductivity. Our formalism allows to map all these properties to real space lattice sites as local markers, which can help to explain the spatial inhomogeneity of optical properties detected by near-field scanning optical microscopy, as demonstrated by a minimal model of 3D topological insulators. In addition, the dielectric function marker can be used to detect a recently proposed fidelity marker, or equivalently the spread of valence-band Wannier functions generalized to disordered insulators.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of helical states revealed by crossed Andreev reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge states of a quantum spin Hall insulator exhibit helical properties, which has generated significant interest in the field of spintronics. Although it is predicted theoretically that Rashba spin-orbit coupling can effectively regulate edge state spin, experimental characterization of this spin control remains challenging. Here, we propose utilizing crossed Andreev reflection to probe the efficiency of gate voltage control on edge state spin. We calculate the transport properties of the quantum spin Hall isolators-superconductor heterojunction by using non-equilibrium Green's function method. We find that the probabilities of crossed Andreev reflection, electron transmission, and non-local conductance all include the relative spin rotation angle $\theta$ caused by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the helical edge states. Notably, when the incident energy is close to the superconducting gap, the differential conductance $G_2\propto-\cos{\theta}$. Thus, the influence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on edge state spin can be quantitatively characterized by crossed Andreev reflection, which provides a feasible scheme for experimental testing.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe methods to construct digital quantum simulation algorithms for quantum spin systems on a regular lattice with local interactions. In addition to tools such as the Trotter-Suzuki expansion and graph coloring, we also discuss the efficiency gained by parallel execution of an extensive number of commuting terms. We provide resource estimates and quantum circuit elements for the most important cases and classes of spin systems. As resource estimates we indicate the total number of gates $N$ and simulation time $T$, expressed in terms of the number $n$ of spin 1/2 lattice sites (qubits), target accuracy $\epsilon$, and simulated time $t$. We provide circuit constructions that realize the simulation time $T^{(1)}\propto nt^2/\epsilon$ and $T^{(2q)}\propto t^{1+\eta}n^\eta/\epsilon^\eta$ for arbitrarily small $\eta=1/2q$ for the first-order and higher-order Trotter expansions. We also discuss the potential impact of scaled gates, which have not yet been fully explored.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Luttinger parameter from a single wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy physics of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) is controlled by the Luttinger parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Altermagnetic Phases through Quantum Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently delimited altermagnetic phase is characterized by zero net magnetization but momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To explore the intriguing physical effects and potential applications of altermagnets, it is essential to analyze their Fermi surface properties, encompassing both configurations and spin textures. Here, we conduct a Fermiology study on metallic altermagnets and demonstrate that the collinear spin-split features of their Fermi surfaces can be clearly revealed through quantum oscillation measurements. By introducing a transverse Zeeman field to remove the spin-degenerate lines in the momentum space, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to spin-flipped cyclotron motion between orbits with opposite spins. Accordingly, the Lifshitz-Onsager quantization yields two sets of Landau levels, leading to frequency splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in conductivity. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman field causes two separate cyclotron orbits to merge at the Lifshitz transition point before splitting again. This results in the two original frequencies discontinuously changing into a single frequency equal to their sum. Our work unveils a unique and universal signature of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces that can be probed through quantum oscillation measurements.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials with stacked van der Waals (vdW) layers hosting non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Using high throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). We show that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-atomic-layer slabs separated by two I layers can accommodate a variety of metal atoms giving arise to topologically non-trivial features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce entanglement when applied to a part of the resource state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result contributes to mitigating noise in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.</description>
