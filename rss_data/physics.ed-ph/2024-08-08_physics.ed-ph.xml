      <title>Integrating Evolutionary Biology into Physics Classroom: Scaling, Dimension, Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Galileo and (more recently) D'Arcy Thompson, it has been understood that physical processes and constraints influence biological structures and their resulting functions. However these cross-discpline connections -- and their importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are rarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of physics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an important geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon clicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary concepts. By connecting abstract physical laws with biological (and technological) applications, our approach aims to help students appreciate the deep connections between physical and biological sciences, thereby enriching the learning experience in introductory physics courses.</description>

      <title>From enrollment to exams: Perceived stress dynamics among first-year physics students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current dropout rate in physics studies in Germany is about 60\%, with the majority of dropouts occurring in the first year. Consequently, the physics study entry phase poses a significant challenge for many students. Students' stress perceptions can provide more profound insights into the processes and challenges during that period. In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points involving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated students' stress perceptions with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified underlying sources of stress, and assessed self-estimated workloads across two different cohorts. This examination occurred almost every week during the first semester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of 3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent stress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by significant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from $M=20.1, SD=15.9$ to $M=63.6, SD=13.4$ on a scale from 0 to 100. Stress levels rise in the first weeks of the lecture, followed by stable, elevated stress levels until the exams and a relaxation phase afterward during the lecture-free time and Christmas vacation. In the first half of the lecture period, students primarily indicated the weekly exercise sheets, the physics lab course, and math courses as stressors; later on, preparation for exams and the exams themselves emerged as the most important stressors. Together with the students' self-estimated workloads that correlate with the PSQ scores, we can create a coherent picture of stress perceptions among first-year physics students, which builds the basis for supportive measures and interventions.</description>
