      <title>Idiosyncratic Risk, Government Debt and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does public debt matter for price stability? If it is useful for the private sector to insure idiosyncratic risk, government debt expansions can increase the natural rate of interest and create inflation. As I demonstrate using a tractable model, this holds in the presence of an active Taylor rule and does not require the absence of future fiscal consolidation. Further analysis using a full-blown 2-asset HANK model reveals the quantitative magnitude of the mechanism to crucially depend on the structure of the asset market: under standard assumptions, the effect of public debt on the natural rate is either overly strong or overly weak. Employing a parsimonious way to overcome this issue, my framework suggests relevant effects of public debt on inflation under active monetary policy: In particular, persistently elevated public debt may make it harder to go the last "mile of disinflation" unless central banks explicitly take its effect on the neutral rate into account.</description>

      <title>Modelling Global Fossil CO2 Emissions with a Lognormal Distribution: A Climate Policy Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have emerged as a critical issue with profound impacts on the environment, human health, and the global economy. The steady increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to climate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax, Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally, we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming years and propose two policies for reducing total fossil CO2 emissions. Our research aims to provide policy-makers with accurate and detailed information to support effective climate change mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Firm Entry and Exit with Unbounded Productivity Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Hopenhayn's (1992) entry-exit model productivity is bounded, implying that the predicted firm size distribution cannot match the power law tail observable in the data. In this paper we remove the boundedness assumption and, in this more general setting, provide an exact characterization of existence of stationary equilibria, as well as a novel sufficient condition for existence based on treating production as a Lyapunov function. We also provide new representations of the rate of entry and aggregate supply. Finally, we prove that the firm size distribution has a power law tail under a very broad set of productivity growth specifications.</description>
