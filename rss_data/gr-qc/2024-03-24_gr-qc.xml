      <title>Topology of dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the thermodynamic topological method to classify critical points for the dyonic AdS black holes with QTE in the EGB background. To this end, we find that there is a small/large BH phase transition in any space-time dimension, a conventional critical point exists with the total topological charge of $Q_t=-1$. The existence of the coupling constant $\alpha$ gives rise to a more intricate phase structure of the black hole, with the emergence of a triple points requires $\alpha\geq0.5$ and $d=6$. Interestingly, the condition for the simultaneous occurrence of small/intermediate and intermediate/large phase transition is that the coupling constant a takes a special value ($\alpha=0.5$), the two conventional critical points $(CP_{1},CP_{2})$ of the black hole are (physical) critical point, and the novel critical point that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free energy. The critical point ($Q_{CP_1}=Q_{CP_2}=-1$) is observed to occur at the maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical point $(Q_{CP_3}=1)$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature. Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical points. With the increase of the coupling constant $(\alpha = 1 )$, although the system has three critical points, only $CP_{1}$ is a (physical) critical point, and the $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase annihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $\alpha$ has a non-negligible effect on the phase structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Time and frequency transfers in optical spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the null geodesic equations for a ray of light is a difficult task even considering a stationary spacetime. The problem becomes even more difficult if the electromagnetic signal propagates through a flowing optical medium. Indeed, because of the interaction between light and matter, the signal does not follow a null geodesic path of the spacetime metric anymore. However, having a clear description of how the time and frequency transfers are affected in this very situation is of a prime importance in astronomy. As a matter of fact, ranging to satellites and Moon, very long baseline interferometry, global navigation satellite systems, and radio occultation experiments are few examples of techniques involving light propagation in flowing optical media. By applying the time transfer functions formalism to optical spacetime, we show that the time and frequency transfers can be determined iteratively up to any desired order within the quasi-Minkowskian path approximation. We present some applications in the context of radio occultation experiments and discuss possible future applications to the modeling of tropospheric delays.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bianchi-I cosmology in the Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of Bianchi-I space-times within the framework of the Horndeski theory with $G_5=\text{const}/X$. The space-times are filled a global unidirectional electromagnetic field interacting with a scalar field. We consider the minimal interaction and the non-minimal interaction by the law $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time, so the question arises of regulating the anisotropic level in this theory. Using the reconstruction method, we build models in which the anisotropic level tends to a small value as the Universe expands. One of the results is a model with a anisotropic bounce.</description>

      <title>Hot Casimir Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have for the first time considered the consequences of thermal fluctuations to the Casimir effect on a traversable wormhole. This was done by using finite temperature generalization of the Casimir effect as a source of a hot traversable wormhole. Thus, we have considered a more physical scenario, where the effects of thermal fluctuations are also considered as a source of a traversable wormhole. To obtain a dependence on such a thermal Casimir effect, consider the plates positioned at a distance either parametrically fixed or radially varying. In both cases, the temperature effects are investigated. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modify the throat of the wormhole. Such results have been obtained in both regimes, i.e. high temperature and low temperature. We explicitly investigate the effect of such finite temperature effects on the size of a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on the robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We preform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with and observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise by each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

      <title>Spatial covariant gravity with two degrees of freedom in the presence of an auxiliary scalar field: perturbation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of gravity theories respecting only spatial covariance, termed spatially covariant gravity, in the presence of an auxiliary scalar field. We examine the conditions on the Lagrangian required to eliminate scalar degrees of freedom, allowing only two tensorial degrees of freedom to propagate. Instead of strict constraint analysis, in this work, we employ the perturbation method and focus on the necessary conditions to evade the scalar mode at linear order in perturbations around a cosmological background. Starting from a general action and solving the auxiliary perturbation variables in terms of the would-be dynamical scalar mode, we derive the condition to remove its kinetic term, thus ensuring that no scalar mode propagates. As an application of the general condition, we study a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. We find that the auxiliary scalar field plays a nontrivial role, and new terms in the Lagrangian are allowed. Our analysis sheds light on constructing gravity theories with two degrees of freedom in the extended framework of spatially covariant gravity.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

      <title>Which symmetry group for elementary particles with an electric charge today and in the past?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding $G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>de Sitter Connectivity from Holographic Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering two antipodal observers in de Sitter space, we illustrate how spacetime connectivity between the holographic screens located on the (stretched) horizons emerges from holographic entanglement. To do so, we construct a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription in de Sitter space, including quantum corrections. While this prescription is inspired by the bilayer proposal, we argue that the monolayer proposal appears to be inconsistent. Entanglement wedge reconstruction implies an extension of static patch holography where the exterior region connecting the static patches is included, and reconstructible from the two screens. A phase transition occurs where there is an exchange of dominance between two competing quantum extremal surfaces, leading to a transfer of the encoding of the exterior region from one screen to the other. The effects in the bulk of integrating out degrees of freedom from the screens are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Collapse of Pressureless Matter in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an early matter phase of the Universe existed after inflation with the proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of gravitational waves produced in this scenario.</description>

      <title>First investigation of void statistics in numerical relativity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the kinetic curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%. Within the limits of resolution of the simulations, the results are consistent with the parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation in Various Dynamical Dark Energy Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$, the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models, with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative $d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models, whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: The theory of inflation provides an elegant explanation for the nearly flat universe observed today, which represents one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model. However, recent studies have reported some deviations from a flat geometry, arguing that a closed universe would be instead favored by observations. Given its central role played in the cosmological context, this paper revisits the issue of spatial curvature in light of the stochastic gravitational wave background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration. For this purpose, we investigate the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and their propagation in the post-inflationary universe. We propose a new parametrization of the gravitational wave power spectrum, taking into account spatial curvature, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index of tensor perturbations. Therefore, we compare the theoretical predictions with NANOGrav data to possibly constrain the geometry of the universe. We find that the choice of the priors has a significant effect on the computed posterior distributions. In particular, using flat uniform priors results in $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= 0.00 \pm 0.67$ at the 68\% confidence level. On the other hand, imposing a Planck prior, we obtain $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= -0.05 \pm 0.17$ at the 68\% confidence level. This result aligns with the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and no deviations from a flat universe are found.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Universe with Next Generation Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-filed regime, respectively.</description>

Abstract: A quantum cosmological bouncing model may exhibit an ambiguity stemming from the nonclassical nature of the background evolution: two classically equivalent theories can produce two qualitatively different potentials sourcing the perturbations. We derive explicitly the quantum canonical transformation involving the quantum background to show how it leads to inequivalent theories. We identify the relevant quantum parameter describing the difference and expand upon the ambiguity by calculating the expected power spectra produced for initial quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase of both potentials. We find that one spectral index corresponds to all values of this parameter but one, while the other thus represents a set of measure zero.</description>

      <title>On the foundations of entropic cosmologies: inconsistencies, possible solutions and dead end signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we explore the foundations of entropic cosmology and highlight some important flaws which have emerged and adopted in the recent literature. We argue that, when applying entropy and temperature on the cosmological horizon by assuming the holographic principle for all thermodynamic approaches to cosmology and gravity, one must derive the consistent thermodynamic quantities following Clausius relation. One key assumption which is generally overlooked, is that in this process one must assume a mass-to-horizon relation, which is generally taken as a linear one. We show that, regardless of the type of entropy chosen on the cosmological horizon, when a thermodynamically consistent corresponding temperature is considered, all modified entropic force models are equivalent to and indistinguishable from the original entropic force models based on standard Bekenstein entropy and Hawking temperature. As such, they are also plagued by the same problems and inability to describe in a satisfactory qualitative and quantitative way the cosmological dynamics as it emerges from the probes we have. We also show that the standard accepted parameterization for Hawking temperature (including a $\gamma$ rescaling) is actually not correctly applied, namely, it is not related to entropy in a thermodynamically consistent way. Finally, we clearly state that the explicit form of the entropic force on cosmological horizons is mostly dictated by the assumption on the mass-to-horizon relation. As such, we discuss what should be done in order to fix all such issues, and what conceptually could be implied by its correct implementation in order to advance in the field.</description>

      <title>Swarm-intelligent search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

      <title>Probing nontensorial gravitational waves with a next-generation ground-based detector network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, there are only two polarizations for gravitational waves. However, up to six polarizations are possible in a generic metric theory of gravity. Therefore, measuring the polarization content of gravitational waves provides an efficient way to test theories of gravity. We analyze the sensitivity of a next-generation ground-based detector network to nontensorial polarizations. We present our method to localize GW signals in the time-frequency domain and construct the model-independent null stream for events with known sky locations. We obtain results based on simulations of binary neutron star mergers in a six-detector network. For a single event at a luminosity distance $D_L=100 \, {\rm Mpc}$, at $5\sigma$ confidence, the smallest amplitude for detection of scalar and vector modes relative to tensor modes are respectively $A_{s}=0.045 $ and $A_{v}=0.014 $. For multiple events in an averaged observing run of 10 years, the detection limits at $5\sigma$ confidence are $A_s=0.05$ and $A_v=0.02$. If we are fortunate, a few strong events might significantly improve the limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the experience of a linearly accelerated observer with acceleration $a$, interacting with a massless scalar field in its vacuum state in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime, is identical to that of a static observer interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state of temperature $a/2\pi$ in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime. We study the robustness of this duality by comparing an observer undergoing circular motion in a thermal bath with an observer that undergoes circular motion around a linearly accelerated trajectory. We find that in most regimes, observers in these two cases experience the field in different ways, and are generally able to tell the difference between the two cases by measuring observables localized along their trajectories.</description>

      <title>Generalised Gaussian states in group field theory and $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define generalised Gaussian states for quantum cosmological models based on the $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ algebra, with particular emphasis on its realisation in group field theory for a single field mode, and study their semiclassical properties. These states are generalisations of coherent, squeezed and thermal states considered previously. As two possible characterisations of semiclassicality, we contrast the requirement of small relative fluctuations in volume and energy with the saturation of the Robertson--Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. We find that for the most general class of states the appearance of small relative fluctuations, which we take as the main criterion relevant for the emergence of cosmology, is mostly determined by the amount of displacement used to define the state. We also observe that defining such generalised Gaussian states is less straightforward in the algebraic approach to canonical quantisation of group field theory, and discuss special cases.</description>

      <title>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Testing strengths, limitations and biases of current Pulsar Timing Arrays detection analyses on realistic data</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves (GWs) in pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA) second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the perturbative stability of Euclidean axion-dilaton wormholes that asymptotically approach flat space, both with a massless and a massive dilaton, and focussing on homogeneous perturbations. We find massless wormholes to always be perturbatively stable. The phenomenologically more relevant case of a massive dilaton presents us with a wide variety of wormhole solutions, depending on the dilaton coupling and mass, and on the axion charge. We find that the solutions with the smallest dilaton potential are perturbatively stable and dominant, even in cases where the wormhole solutions are not continuously connected to the massless case by decreasing the mass. For branches of solutions emanating from a bifurcation point, one side of the branch always contains a negative mode in its spectrum, rendering such solutions unstable. The existence of classes of perturbatively stable wormhole solutions with massive dilaton sharpens the puzzles associated with Euclidean wormholes.</description>
