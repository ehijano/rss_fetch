      <title>Multi-Symmetric Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-symmetric generalization of the classical Schur functions called the multi-symmetric Schur functions. These functions form an integral basis for the ring of multi-symmetric functions indexed by tuples of partitions and are defined as certain stable-limits of key polynomials. We prove combinatorial results about the monomial expansions of the multi-symmetric Schur functions including a diagrammatic combinatorial formula and a triangularity result which completely characterizes their monomial multi-symmetric supports. The triangularity result involves a non-trivial generalization of the dominance order on partitions to tuples of partitions. We prove, using the Demazure character formula, that the multi-symmetric Schur functions expand positively into the basis of tensor products of ordinary Schur functions and describe the expansion coefficients as multiplicities of certain irreducible representations for Levi subgroups inside particular Demazure modules. Lastly, we find a family of multi-symmetric plethystic operators related to the classical Bernstein operators which act on the multi-symmetric Schur basis by a simple recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>Matroidal representations of low rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tropical subrepresentations of the Boolean regular representation $\mathbb{B}[G]$ of a finite group $G$. These are equivalent to the matroids on ground set $G$ for which left-multiplication by each element of $G$ is a matroid automorphism. We completely classify the tropical subrepresentations of $\mathbb{B}[G]$ for rank 3. When $G$ is an abelian group, our approach can be seen as a generalization of Golomb rulers. In doing so, we also introduce an interesting class of matroids obtained from equivalence relations on finite sets.</description>

      <title>Extendibility of Latin Hypercuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Latin hypercuboid of order $n$ is a $d$-dimensional matrix of dimensions $n\times n\times\cdots\times n\times k$, with symbols from a set of cardinality $n$ such that each symbol occurs at most once in each axis-parallel line. If $k=n$ the hypercuboid is a Latin hypercube. The Latin hypercuboid is \emph{completable} if it is contained in a Latin hypercube of the same order and dimension. It is \emph{extendible} if it can have one extra layer added. In this note we consider which Latin hypercuboids are completable/extendible. We also consider a generalisation that involves multidimensional arrays of sets that satisfy certain balance properties. The extendibility problem corresponds to choosing representatives from the sets in a way that is analogous to a choice of a Hall system of distinct representatives, but in higher dimensions. The completability problem corresponds to partitioning the sets into such SDRs. We provide a construction for such an array of sets that does not have the property analogous to completability. A related concept was introduced by H\"aggkvist under the name $(m,m,m)$-array. We generalise a construction of $(m,m,m)$-arrays credited to Pebody, but show that it cannot be used to build the arrays that we need.</description>

      <title>On the structure of modular lattices -- Unique gluing and dissection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proves that the process of gluing finite lattices to form a larger lattice is bijective, that is each lattice is the glued sum of a unique system of finite lattices, provided the class of lattices is constrained to modular, locally-finite lattices with finite covers. The results of this work are not surprising given the prior literature, but this seems to be the first proof that the processes of gluing and dissection can be made inverses, and hence that gluing is bijective.</description>

      <title>Covering points with planes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that each proper subset of a set $S$ of points in a vector space is contained in the union of planes of specified dimensions, but $S$ itself is not contained in any such union. How large can $|S|$ be?
  We prove a general upper bound on $|S|$, which is tight in some cases, for example when all of the planes have the same dimension. We produce an example showing that this upper bound does not hold for point sets whose proper subsets are covered by lines in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^2$ with $k\geq 2$, and prove an upper bound in this case. We also investigate the analogous problem for general matroids.</description>

      <title>Preservation of log-concavity on gamma polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every symmetric polynomial $h(x) = h_0 + h_1\,x + \cdots + h_n\,x^n$, where $h_i = h_{n-i}$ for each $i$, can be expressed as a linear combination in the basis $\{x^i(1+x)^{n-2i}\}_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$. The polynomial $\gamma_h(x) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \,x+ \cdots + \gamma_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\, x^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$, commonly referred to as the $\gamma$-polynomial of $h(x)$, records the coefficients of the aforementioned linear combination. Two decades ago, Br\"and\'en and Gal independently showed that if $\gamma_h(x)$ has nonpositive real roots only, then so does $h(x)$. More recently, Br\"and\'en, Ferroni, and Jochemko proved using Lorentzian polynomials that if $\gamma_h(x)$ is ultra log-concave, then so is $h(x)$, and they raised the question of whether a similar statement can be proved for the usual notion of log-concavity. The purpose of this article is to show that the answer to the question of Br\"anden, Ferroni, and Jochemko is affirmative. One of the crucial ingredients of the proof is an inequality involving binomial numbers that we establish via a path-counting argument.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Tur\'an number of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start a systematic investigation concerning bipartite Tur\'an number for trees. For a graph $F$ and integers $1 \leq a \leq b$ we define:
  $(i)$\quad $ex_b(a, b, F)$ is the largest number of edges that an $F$-free bipartite graph can have with part sizes $a$ and $b$. We write $ex_b(n, F)$ for $ex_b(n, n, F)$.
  $(ii)$\quad $ex_{b,c}(a, b, F)$ is the largest number of edges that an $F$-free connected, bipartite graph can have with part sizes $a$ and $b$. We write $ex_{b,c}(n, F)$ for $ex{b,c}(n, n, F)$.
  Both definitions are similar for a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs.
  We prove general lower bounds depending on the maximum degree of $F$, as well as on the cardinalities of the two vertex classes of $F$.
  We derive upper and lower bounds for $ex_b(n,F)$ in terms of $ex(2n,F)$ and $ex(n, F)$, the corresponding classical (not bipartite) Tur\'an numbers.
  We solve both problems for various classes of graphs, including all trees up to six vertices for any $n$, for double stars $D_{s ,t}$ if $a \geq f(s,t )$, for some families of spiders, and more.
  We use these results to supply an answer to a problem raised by L. T. Yuan and X. D. Zhang [{\it Graphs and Combinatorics}, 2017] concerning $ex_b( n, \mathcal{T}_{k,\ell} )$, where $\mathcal{T}_{k,\ell}$ is the family of all trees with vertex classes of respective cardinalities $k$ and $\ell$.
  The asymptotic worst-case ratios between Tur\'an-type functions are also inverstigated.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative chromatic quasi-symmetric functions, Macdonald polynomials, and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As shown in our paper [JCTA 177 (2021), Paper No. 105305], the chromatic quasi-symmetric function of Shareshian-Wachs can be lifted to ${\bf WQSym}$, the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions in noncommuting variables. We investigate here its behaviour with respect to classical transformations of alphabets and propose a noncommutative analogue of Macdonald polynomials compatible with a noncommutative version of the Haglund-Wilson formula. We also introduce a multi-$t$ version of these noncommutative analogues. For rectangular partitions, their commutative images at $q=0$ appear to coincide with the multi-$t$ Hall-Littlewood functions introduced in [Lett. Math. Phys. 35 (1995), 359]. This leads us to conjecture that for rectangular partitions, multi-$t$ Macdonald polynomials are obtained as equivariant traces of certain Yang-Baxter elements of Hecke algebras. We also conjecture that all (ordinary) Macdonald polynomials can be obtained in this way. We conclude with some remarks relating various aspects of quasi-symmetric chromatic functions to calculations in Hecke algebras. In particular, we show that all modular relations are given by the product formula of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and constructions of vertices of the polytope of polystochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multidimensional nonnegative matrix is called polystochastic if the sum of entries in each of its lines equals $1$. The set of all polystochastic matrices of order $n$ and dimension $d$ is a convex polytope $\Omega_n^d$ known as the Birkhoff polytope. In this paper, we identify all vertices of the polytopes $\Omega_4^3$ and $\Omega_3^4$ correcting the results of Ke, Li, and Xiao (2016). Additionally, we describe constructions vertices of $\Omega_n^d$ using multidimensional matrix products and find symmetric vertices of $\Omega_3^d$ for all $d \geq 4$ with large support sizes.</description>

      <title>On the stress transit function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stress interval $S(u,v)$ between $u,v\in V(G)$ is the set of all vertices in a graph $G$ that lie on every shortest $u,v$-path. A set $U \subseteq V(G)$ is stress convex if $S(u,v) \subseteq U$ for any $u,v\in U$. A vertex $v \in V(G)$ is s-extreme if $V(G)-v$ is a stress convex set in $G$. The stress number $sn(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set $U$ where $\bigcup_{u,v \in U}S(u,v)=V(G)$. The stress hull number $sh(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set whose stress convex hull is $V(G)$. In this paper, we present many basic properties of stress intervals. We characterize s-extreme vertices of a graph $G$ and construct graphs $G$ with arbitrarily large difference between the number of s-extreme vertices, $sh(G)$ and $sn(G)$. Then we study these three invariants for some special graph families, such as graph products, split graphs, and block graphs. We show that in any split graph $G$, $sh(G)=sn(G)=|Ext_s(G)|$, where $Ext_s(G)$ is the set of s-extreme vertices of $G$. Finally, we show that for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, deciding whether $sn(G) \leq k$ is NP-complete problem, even when restricted to bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Bijections in weakly increasing trees via binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a unification of increasing trees and plane trees, the weakly increasing trees labeled by a multiset was introduced by Lin-Ma-Ma-Zhou in 2021. Motived by some symmetries in plane trees proved recently by Dong, Du, Ji and Zhang, we construct four bijections on weakly increasing trees in the same flavor via switching the role of left child and right child of some specified nodes in their corresponding binary trees. Consequently, bijective proofs of the aforementioned symmetries found by Dong et al. and a non-recursive construction of a bijection on plane trees of Deutsch are provided. Applications of some symmetries in weakly increasing trees to permutation patterns and statistics will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>The number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an operator formula for the number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row, generalizing alternating sign matrices. The special case of the formula for monotone triangles previously provided an alternative proof for the enumeration of alternating sign matrices and led to several results on alternating sign triangles and alternating sign trapezoids. The generalization presented in this paper reveals an additional ``hidden operator'' that is annihilated in the special case of monotone triangles, whose discovery was a major challenge.
  The enumeration formula is conceptually simple: it applies, in addition to the newly discovered hidden operator, an operator ensuring row strictness to the formula for the number of Gelfand--Tsetlin trapezoids. Notably, the top row of the monotone trapezoid is not prescribed. Thus, our result involves a free boundary, which is a novel situation in this area. We also uncover an unexpected relation to the coinvariant algebra and propose a conjecture on its generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group, and let $\mathcal{X}$ be a set of integers greater than one. We consider the directed $\mathcal{X}$-excluded power graph of $G$, which takes $G$ as its vertex set and has an edge from $g$ to each power of $g$ other than itself provided the power is not divisible by any element of $\mathcal{X}$. We show that when $G=H\times K$ for $H$ and $K$ with coprime orders, excluding the prime factors of $|H|$ yields a power graph with a quotient consisting of multiple copies of a quotient of the power graph (no exclusions) of $K$. For any prime $p$, we describe the groups whose directed and undirected $\{p\}$-excluded power graphs consist of disjoint (directed) cliques.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any triple of complete flags in $\mathbb R^d$ admits a common generating set of size $\lfloor 5d/3\rfloor$ and that this bound is sharp. This result extends the classical linear-algebraic fact -- a consequence of the Bruhat decomposition of $\text{GL}_d(\mathbb R)$ -- that any pair of complete flags in $\mathbb R^d$ admits a common generating set of size $d$. We also deduce an analogue for $m$-tuples of flags with $m&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Interpolating chromatic and homomorphism thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of chromatic thresholds seeks for minimum degree conditions that ensure $H$-free graphs to have a bounded chromatic number, or equivalently a bounded size homomorphic image. The strengthened homomorphism thresholds problem further requires that the homomorphic image itself is $H$-free. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we define a generalized notion of threshold which encapsulates and interpolates chromatic and homomorphism thresholds via the theory of VC-dimension. Our first result shows a smooth transition between these two thresholds when varying the restrictions on homomorphic images. In particular, we proved that for $t \ge s \ge 3$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $K_s$-free graph with VC-dimension $d$ and $\delta(G) \ge (\frac{(s-3)(t-s+2)+1}{(s-2)(t-s+2)+1} + \epsilon)n$, then $G$ is homomorphic to a $K_t$-free graph $H$ with $|H| = O(1)$. Moreover, we construct graphs showing that this minimum degree condition is optimal. This extends and unifies the results of Thomassen, {\L}uczak and Thomass\'e, and Goddard, Lyle and Nikiforov, and provides a deeper insight into the cause of existences of homomorphic images with various properties.
  Second, we introduce the blowup threshold $\delta_B(H)$ as the infimum $\alpha$ such that every $n$-vertex maximal $H$-free graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge\alpha n$ is a blowup of some $F$ with $|F|=O(1)$. This notion strengthens homomorphism threshold. While the homomorphism thresholds for odd cycles remain unknown, we prove that $\delta_B(C_{2k-1})=1/(2k-1)$ for any integer $k\ge 2$. This strengthens the result of Ebsen and Schacht and answers a question of Schacht and shows that, in sharp contrast to the chromatic thresholds, 0 is an accumulation point for blowup thresholds. Our proofs mix tools from VC-dimension theory and an iterative refining process, and draw connection to a problem concerning codes on graphs.</description>

Abstract: Can machine learning help discover new mathematical structures? In this article we discuss an approach to doing this which one can call "mathematical data science". In this paradigm, one studies mathematical objects collectively rather than individually, by creating datasets and doing machine learning experiments and interpretations. After an overview, we present two case studies: murmurations in number theory and loadings of partitions related to Kronecker coefficients in representation theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Orthology and Near-Cographs in the Context of Phylogenetic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthologous genes, which arise through speciation, play a key role in comparative genomics and functional inference. In particular, graph-based methods allow for the inference of orthology estimates without prior knowledge of the underlying gene or species trees. This results in orthology graphs, where each vertex represents a gene, and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding genes are estimated to be orthologs. Orthology graphs inferred under a tree-like evolutionary model must be cographs. However, real-world data often deviate from this property, either due to noise in the data, errors in inference methods or, simply, because evolution follows a network-like rather than a tree-like process. The latter, in particular, raises the question of whether and how orthology graphs can be derived from or, equivalently, are explained by phylogenetic networks. Here, we study the constraints imposed on orthology graphs when the underlying evolutionary history follows a phylogenetic network instead of a tree. We show that any orthology graph can be represented by a sufficiently complex level-k network. However, such networks lack biologically meaningful constraints. In contrast, level-1 networks provide a simpler explanation, and we establish characterizations for level-1 explainable orthology graphs, i.e., those derived from level-1 evolutionary histories. To this end, we employ modular decomposition, a classical technique for studying graph structures. Specifically, an arbitrary graph is level-1 explainable if and only if each primitive subgraph is a near-cograph (a graph in which the removal of a single vertex results in a cograph). Additionally, we present a linear-time algorithm to recognize level-1 explainable orthology graphs and to construct a level-1 network that explains them, if such a network exists.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Waves and Edge Eigenvectors of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backhausz and Szegedy (2019) demonstrated that the almost eigenvectors of random regular graphs converge to Gaussian waves with variance $0\leq \sigma^2\leq 1$. In this paper, we present an alternative proof of this result for the edge eigenvectors of random regular graphs, establishing that the variance must be $\sigma^2=1$. Furthermore, we show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are asymptotically independent. Our approach introduces a simple framework linking the weak convergence of the imaginary part of the Green's function to the convergence of eigenvectors, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of the Taylor coefficients of differentially algebraic power series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f=\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n x^n \in \overline{\mathbb Q}[[x]$ be a solution of an algebraic differential equation $Q(x,y(x), \ldots, y^{(k)}(x))=0$, where $Q$ is a multivariate polynomial with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. The sequence $(f_n)_{n\ge 0}$ satisfies a non-linear recurrence, whose expression involves a polynomial $M$ of degree $s$. When the equation is linear, $M$ is its indicial polynomial at the origin. We show that when $M$ is split over $\mathbb Q$, there exist two positive integers $\delta$ and $\nu$ such that the denominator of $f_n$ divides $\delta^{n+1}(\nu n+\nu)!^{2s}$ for all $n\ge 0\ $, generalizing a well-known property when the equation is linear. This proves in this case a strong form of a conjecture of Mahler that P\'olya--Popken's upper bound $n^{\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))}$ for the denominator of $f_n$ is not optimal. This also enables us to make Sibuya and Sperber's bound $\vert f_n\vert_v\le e^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$, for all finite places $v$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, explicit in this case. Our method is completely effective and rests upon a detailed $p$-adic analysis of the above mentioned non-linear recurrences. Finally, we present various examples of differentially algebraic functions for which the associated polynomial $M$ is split over $\mathbb Q$, among which are Weierstra\ss' elliptic $\wp$ function, solutions of Painlev\'e equations, and Lagrange's solution to Kepler's equation.</description>

      <title>Depth-Bounds for Neural Networks via the Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.</description>

      <title>A LP-rounding based algorithm for soft capacitated facility location problem with submodular penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft capacitated facility location problem (SCFLP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem, with its variants widely applied in the fields of operations research and computer science. In the SCFLP, given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of facilities and a set $\mathcal{D}$ of clients, each facility has a capacity and an open cost, allowing to open multiple times, and each client has a demand.
  This problem is to find a subset of facilities in $\mathcal{F}$ and connect each client to the facilities opened, such that the total cost including open cost and connection cost is minimied. SCFLP is a NP-hard problem, which has led to a focus on approximation algorithms. Based on this, we consider a variant, that is, soft capacitated facility location problem with submodular penalties (SCFLPSP), which allows some clients not to be served by accepting the penalty cost. And we consider the integer splittable case of demand, that is, the demand of each client is served by multiple facilities with the integer service amount by each facility. Based on LP-rounding, we propose a $(\lambda R+4)$-approximation algorithm, where $R=\frac{\max_{i \in \mathcal{F} }f_i}{\min_{i \in \mathcal{F} }f_i},\lambda=\frac{R+\sqrt{R^2+8R}}{2R}$. In particular, when the open cost is uniform, the approximation ratio is 6.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of dense kernel-based random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based random graphs (KBRGs) are a broad class of random graph models that account for inhomogeneity among vertices. We consider KBRGs on a discrete $d-$dimensional torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N^d$. Conditionally on an i.i.d.~sequence of weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{\kappa_{\sigma}(W_i,W_j)}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\kappa_{\sigma}(u,v)= (u\vee v)(u \wedge v)^{\sigma}$ for some $\sigma\in(0,\tau-1)$.
  We focus on the adjacency operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. For $\alpha&lt;d$ and $\tau&gt;2$, we show that a non-trivial limiting distribution exists as $N\to\infty$. The corresponding measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and we analyse its moments. The measure is given by an operator-valued semicircle law, whose Stieltjes transform is characterised by a fixed point equation in an appropriate Banach space. In the case $\sigma=1$, corresponding to the so-called scale-free percolation random graph, we can explicitly describe the limiting measure and study its tail.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the set $\mathcal{D}$ of values of the quadruplet $(\underline{\mathrm{d}}(A),\overline{\mathrm{d}}(A),\underline{\mathrm{d}}(2A),\overline{\mathrm{d}}(2A))$ where $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ and $\underline{\mathrm{d}},\overline{\mathrm{d}}$ denote the lower and upper asymptotic density, respectively. Completing existing results on the topic, we determine each of its six projections on coordinate planes, that is, the sets of possible values of the six subpairs of the quadruplet. Further, we show that this set $\mathcal{D}$ has non empty interior, in particular has positive measure. To do so, we use among others probabilistic and diophantine methods. Some auxiliary results pertaining to these methods may be of general interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the heat content for Laplacians on compact, finite metric graphs with Dirichlet conditions imposed at the "boundary" (i.e., a given set of vertices). We prove a closed formula of combinatorial flavour, as it is expressed as a sum over all closed orbits hitting the boundary. Our approach delivers a small-time asymptotic expansion that delivers information on crucial geometric quantities of the metric graph, much in the spirit of the celebrated corresponding result for manifolds due to Gilkey-van den Berg; but unlike other known formulae based on different methods, ours holds for all times $t&gt;0$ and it displays stronger decay rate in the short time limit. Furthermore, we prove new surgery principles for the heat content and use them to derive comparison principles for the heat content between metric graphs of different topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant1}$ be a countable set such that $\limsup_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{\log x}\sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\cap[1,x]}\frac{1}{\alpha}&gt;0$. We prove that, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exist infinitely many pairs $(\alpha, \beta)\in \mathcal{A}^2$ such that $\alpha\neq \beta$ and $|n\alpha-\beta| &lt;\varepsilon$ for some positive integer $n$. This resolves a problem of Erd\H{o}s from 1948. A critical role in the proof is played by the machinery of GCD graphs, which were introduced by the first author and by James Maynard in their work on the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture in Diophantine approximation.</description>

      <title>Realizing resolutions of powers of extremal ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremal ideals are a class of square-free monomial ideals which dominate and determine many algebraic invariants of powers of all square-free monomial ideals. For example, the $r^{th}$ power ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ of the extremal ideal on $q$ generators has the maximum Betti numbers among the $r^{th}$ power of any square-free monomial ideal with $q$ generators. In this paper we study the combinatorial and geometric structure of the (minimal) free resolutions of powers of square-free monomial ideals via the resolutions of powers of extremal ideals. Although the end results are algebraic, this problem has a natural interpretation in terms of polytopes and discrete geometry. Our guiding conjecture is that all powers ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ of extremal ideals have resolutions supported on their Scarf simplicial complexes, and thus their resolutions are as small as possible. This conjecture is known to hold for $r \leq 2$ or $q \leq 4$. In this paper we prove the conjecture holds for $r=3$ and any $q\geq 1$ by giving a complete description of the Scarf complex of ${\mathcal{E}_q}^3$. This effectively gives us a sharp bound on the betti numbers and projective dimension of the third power of any square-free momomial ideal. For large $i$ and $q$, our bounds on the $i^{th}$ betti numbers are an exponential improvement over previously known bounds. We also describe a large number of faces of the Scarf complex of ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ for any $r,q \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Inductive Freeness of Ziegler's Canonical Multiderivations for Restrictions of Reflection Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be a free hyperplane arrangement. In 1989, Ziegler showed that the restriction $\mathcal A"$ of $\mathcal A$ to any hyperplane endowed with the natural multiplicity $\kappa$ is then a free multiarrangement. In 2024, the first two authors proved an analogue of Ziegler's theorem for the stronger notion of inductive freeness: if $\mathcal A$ is inductively free, then so is the free multiarrangement $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$. In 2018, all reflection arrangements which admit inductively free Ziegler restrictions were classified by the first two authors. The aim of this paper is an extension of this classification to all restrictions of reflection arrangements utilizing the aforementioned fundamental result from the 2024 paper of the first two authors.</description>

      <title>Three-cuts are a charm: acyclicity in 3-connected cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bridgeless cubic graph. In 2023, the three authors solved a conjecture (also known as the $S_4$-Conjecture) made by Mazzuoccolo in 2013: there exist two perfect matchings of $G$ such that the complement of their union is a bipartite subgraph of $G$. They actually show that given any $1^+$-factor $F$ (a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that its vertices have degree at least 1) and an arbitrary edge $e$ of $G$, there exists a perfect matching $M$ of $G$ containing $e$ such that $G\setminus (F\cup M)$ is bipartite. This is a step closer to comprehend better the Fan--Raspaud Conjecture and eventually the Berge--Fulkerson Conjecture. The $S_4$-Conjecture, now a theorem, is also the weakest assertion in a series of three conjectures made by Mazzuoccolo in 2013, with the next stronger statement being: there exist two perfect matchings of $G$ such that the complement of their union is an acyclic subgraph of $G$. Unfortunately, this conjecture is not true: Jin, Steffen, and Mazzuoccolo later showed that there exists a counterexample admitting 2-cuts. Here we show that, despite of this, every cyclically 3-edge-connected cubic graph satisfies this second conjecture.</description>

We show that $$\frac{\sum_{uv\in E\left( G \right)}{\varepsilon_3\left( u \right) \varepsilon_3\left( v \right)}}{m\left( G \right)} \leq \frac{\sum_{u\in V\left( G \right)}{\varepsilon_{3}^{2}\left( u \right)}}{n\left( G \right)} $$ holds for all acyclic and unicyclic graphs. Besides, we verify that the inequality may not be applied to graphs with at least two cycles.</description>

      <title>Highly connected orientations from edge-disjoint rigid subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to a long-standing conjecture of Thomassen, stating that every sufficiently highly connected graph has a $k$-vertex-connected orientation. We prove that a connectivity of order $O(k^2)$ suffices. As a key tool, we show that for every pair of positive integers $d$ and $t$, every $(t \cdot h(d))$-connected graph contains $t$ edge-disjoint $d$-rigid (in particular, $d$-connected) spanning subgraphs, where $h(d) = 10d(d+1)$. This also implies a positive answer to the conjecture of Kriesell that every sufficiently highly connected graph $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ such that $G-E(T)$ is $k$-connected.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis on distance-regular Cayley graphs over abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of constructing or characterizing strongly regular Cayley graphs (or equivalently, regular partial difference sets) has garnered significant attention over the past half-century. In 2003, Miklavi\v{c} and Poto\v{c}nik [European J. Combin. 24 (2003) 777--784] expanded upon this field by achieving a complete characterization of distance-regular Cayley graphs over cyclic groups through the method of Schur rings. Building on this work, Miklavi\v{c} and Poto\v{c}nik [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 97 (2007) 14--33] formally proposed the problem of characterizing distance-regular Cayley graphs for arbitrary classes of groups. Within this framework, abelian groups hold particular significance, as numerous distance-regular graphs with classical parameters are precisely Cayley graphs over abelian groups. In this paper, we employ Fourier analysis on abelian groups to establish connections between distance-regular Cayley graphs over abelian groups and combinatorial objects in finite geometry. By combining these insights with classical results from finite geometry, we classify all distance-regular Cayley graphs over the group $\mathbb{Z}_n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is an odd prime.</description>

      <title>The Double Almost-Riordan Arrays and Their Sequence Characterization, Compression, and Total Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define double almost-Riordan arrays and find that the set of all double almost-Riordan arrays forms a group, called the double almost-Riordan group. We also obtain the sequence characteristics of double almost-Riordan arrays and give the production matrices for double almost-Riordan arrays. We define the compression of double almost-Riordan arrays and present their sequence characterization. Finally we give a characteristic for the total positivity of double Riordan arrays, by using which we discuss the total positivity for compressed double almost-Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s unit distance problem for small point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bound on the number of edges in a unit-distance graph on $n$ vertices for each $n\in\{16,\ldots,30\}$. When $n\leq 21$, our bounds match the best known lower bounds, and we fully enumerate the densest unit-distance graphs in these cases.
  On the combinatorial side, our principle technique is to more efficiently generate $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs for a set of forbidden subgraphs $\mathcal{F}$. On the algebraic side, we are able to determine programmatically whether many graphs are unit-distance, using a custom embedder that is more efficient in practice than tools such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>An Extension of P\'{o}lya's Enumeration Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In combinatorics, P\'{o}lya's Enumeration Theorem is a powerful tool for solving a wide range of counting problems, including the enumeration of groups, graphs, and chemical compounds. In this paper, we present an extension of P\'{o}lya's Enumeration Theorem. As an application, we derive a formula that expresses the $n$-th elementary symmetric polynomial in $m$ indeterminates (where $n\leq m$) as a variant of the cycle index polynomial of the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}(n)$. This result resolves a problem posed by Amdeberhan in 2012.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the definition of Freiman homomorphism, we explore the possibilities of formulating some basic notions and techniques of additive combinatorics in a categorical language. We show that additive sets and Freiman homomorphisms form a category and we study several limit and colimit constructions in this, and in an interesting subcategory of this category. Moreover, we study the additive structure of these (co)limit objects using additive doubling constant. We relate this category to that of finite sets and mappings, and that of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. We show that the Konyagin and Lev result on the existence of universal ambient groups is an instance of adjunction</description>

      <title>Hyperpolygonal arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss introduced a particular family of real hyperplane arrangements stemming from hyperpolygonal spaces associated with certain quiver varieties which we thus call hyperpolygonal arrangements $\mathcal H_n$. In this note we study these arrangements and investigate their properties systematically. Remarkably the arrangements $\mathcal H_n$ discriminate between essentially all local properties of arrangements. In addition we show that hyperpolygonal arrangements are projectively unique and combinatorially formal.
  We note that the arrangement $\mathcal H_5$ is the famous counterexample of Edelman and Reiner from 1993 of Orlik's conjecture that the restriction of a free arrangement is again free.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Bases in a Family of Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ that are bases is asymptotic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}(1-2^{-j}) \approx 0.29$ as $d \to \infty$. It is natural to ask whether there exists a (large) subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ such that the proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ that are bases is (asymptotically) greater than this number. As well as being a natural question in its own right, this would imply better lower bounds on the Tur\'an densities of certain hypercubes and `daisy' hypergraphs.
  We give a negative answer to the above question. More generally, we obtain an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the proportion of linearly independent $r$-element subsets of a (large) family of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$, for $r \leq d$. This bound follows from an exact result concerning the probability of obtaining a linearly independent sequence when we randomly sample $r$ elements with replacement from our family of vectors: we show that this probability, for any family of vectors, is at most what it is when the family is the whole space $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$. Our results also go through when $\mathbb{F}_2$ is replaced by $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>On Distance Preserving and Sequentially Distance Preserving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.06404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an \emph{isometric} subgraph of $G$ if $d_H(u,v)= d_G(u,v)$, for every pair~$u,v\in V(H)$. A graph is \emph{distance preserving} if it has an isometric subgraph of every possible order. A graph is \emph{sequentially distance preserving} if its vertices can be ordered such that deleting the first $i$ vertices results in an isometric subgraph, for all $i\ge1$. We give an equivalent condition to sequentially distance preserving based upon simplicial orderings. Using this condition, we prove that if a graph does not contain any induced cycles of length~$5$ or greater, then it is sequentially distance preserving and thus distance preserving. Next we consider the distance preserving property on graphs with a cut vertex. Finally, we define a family of non-distance preserving graphs constructed from cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematical way of constructing S-Ricci flat graphs which are not Abelian Cayley via graph bundle with explicit examples. For this purpose, we prove that, with some natural constrains, a non-trivial graph bundle can not be isomorphic (as graphs) to the product of the base graph and fiber graph. It stands in clear contrast to the continuous case.</description>

      <title>Fast and Simple $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-Edge-Coloring of Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ and $n, \Delta \in \mathbb N$ be such that $\Delta = \Omega\left(\max\left\{\frac{\log n}{\epsilon},\, \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^2\right\}\right)$. Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$, we present a randomized $O\left(m\,\log^3 \Delta\,/\,\epsilon^2\right)$-time algorithm that computes a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of $G$ with high probability. This improves upon the best known results for a wide range of the parameters $\epsilon$, $n$, and $\Delta$. Our approach combines a flagging strategy from earlier work of the author with a shifting procedure employed by Duan, He, and Zhang for dynamic edge-coloring. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and may be of practical interest.</description>
