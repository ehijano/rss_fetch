      <title>An efficient particle tracking method on unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions based on patch searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a particle tracking method for unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions. Our tracking algorithm is based on a patch searching and includes two steps. We first locate the given point to a patch near a vertex, and then the host element is determined within the patch domain. We prove that the patch in the first step can be rapidly identified by constructing an auxiliary Cartesian grid with a prescribed resolution. Then, the second step can be converted into a searching problem, which can be easily solved by searching algorithms. Only coordinates to particles are required in our method. We conduct a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the robustness and efficiency in our method.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Preserving Scheme for the Euler-Poisson-Boltzmann System in the Quasineutral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotic preserving (AP), energy stable and positivity preserving semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Euler-Poisson-Boltzmann (EPB) system in the quasineutral limit. The key to energy stability is the addition of appropriate stabilisation terms into the convective fluxes of mass and momenta, and the source term. The space-time fully-discrete scheme admits the positivity of the mass density, and is consistent with the weak formulation of the EPB system upon mesh refinement. In the quasineutral limit, the numerical scheme yields a consistent, semi-implicit discretisation of the isothermal compressible Euler system, thus leading to the AP property. Several benchmark numerical case studies are performed to confirm the robustness and efficacy of the proposed scheme in the dispersive as well as the quasineutral regimes. The numerical results also corroborates scheme's ability to very well resolve plasma sheaths and the related dynamics, which indicates its potential to applications involving low-temperature plasma problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient and scalable atmospheric dynamics simulations using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the massively parallel performance of a $h$-adaptive solver for atmosphere dynamics that allows for non-conforming mesh refinement. The numerical method is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization, highly scalable thanks to its data locality properties, and on a second order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) method for time discretization, particularly well suited for low Mach number flows. Simulations with non-conforming meshes for flows over orography can increase the accuracy of the local flow description without affecting the larger scales, which can be solved on coarser meshes. We show that the local refining procedure has no significant impact on the parallel performance and, therefore, both efficiency and scalability can be achieved in this framework.</description>

      <title>A computational study of algebraic coarse spaces for two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-level overlapping additive Schwarz method offers a robust and scalable preconditioner for various linear systems resulting from elliptic problems. One of the key to these properties is the construction of the coarse space used to solve a global coupling problem, which traditionally requires information about the underlying discretization. An algebraic formulation of the coarse space reduces the complexity of its assembly. Furthermore, well-chosen coarse basis functions within this space can better represent changes in the problem's properties. Here we introduce an algebraic formulation of the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) based on the algebraic multiscale solver (AMS) in the context of the two-level Schwarz method. We show how AMS is related to other energy-minimizing coarse spaces. Furthermore, we compare the AMS with other algebraic energy-minimizing spaces: the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW), and the reduced dimension GDSW (RGDSW).</description>

      <title>U-WNO: U-Net Enhanced Wavelet Neural Operator for Solving Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are effective tools for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). They can predict solutions of PDEs with different initial and boundary conditions, as well as different input functions. The recently proposed Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) utilizes the time-frequency localization of wavelets to capture spatial manifolds effectively. While WNO has shown promise as an operator learning method, it only parameterizes neural network weights under higher-order wavelet factorization. This approach avoids noise interference but may result in insufficient extraction of high-frequency features from the data. In this study, we propose a new network architecture called U-WNO. It incorporates the U-Net path and residual shortcut into the wavelet layer to enhance the extraction of high-frequency features and improve the learning of spatial manifolds. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Activation Function into the wavelet layer to address the spectral bias of the neural network. The effectiveness of U-WNO is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various problems, including the Burgers equation, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Non-homogeneous Poisson equation, and Wave advection equation. This study also includes a comparative analysis of existing operator learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>On Edge Multiscale Space based Hybrid Schwarz Preconditioner for Helmholtz Problems with Large Wavenumbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel hybrid Schwarz method, termed as edge multiscale space based hybrid Schwarz (EMs-HS), for solving the Helmholtz problem with large wavenumbers. The problem is discretized using $H^1$-conforming nodal finite element methods on meshes of size $h$ decreasing faster than $k^{-1}$ such that the discretization error remains bounded as the wavenumber $k$ increases. EMs-HS consists of a one-level Schwarz preconditioner (RAS-imp) and a coarse solver in a multiplicative way. The RAS-imp preconditioner solves local problems on overlapping subdomains with impedance boundary conditions in parallel, and combines the local solutions using partition of unity. The coarse space is an edge multiscale space proposed in [13]. The key idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over each subdomain by a local bubble part and local Helmholtz harmonic extension part, and then to derive a global splitting by means of the partition of unity. This facilitates representing the solution as the sum of a global bubble part and a global Helmholtz harmonic extension part.
  We prove that the EMs-HS preconditioner leads to a convergent fixed-point iteration uniformly for large wavenumbers, by rigorously analyzing the approximation properties of the coarse space to the global Helmholtz harmonic extension part and to the solution of the adjoint problem. Distinctly, the theoretical convergence analysis are valid in two extreme cases: using minimal overlapping size among subdomains (of order $h$), or using coarse spaces of optimal dimension (of magnitude $k^d$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension). We provide extensive numerical results on the sharpness of the theoretical findings and also demonstrate the method on challenging heterogeneous models.</description>

      <title>Coarsening and parallelism with reduction multigrids for hyperbolic Boltzmann transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduction multigrids have recently shown good performance in hyperbolic problems without the need for Gauss-Seidel smoothers. When applied to the hyperbolic limit of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), these methods result in very close to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ growth in work with problem size on unstructured grids. This scalability relies on the CF splitting producing an $A_\textrm{ff}$ block that is easy to invert. We introduce a parallel two-pass CF splitting designed to give diagonally dominant $A_\textrm{ff}$. The first pass computes a maximal independent set in the symmetrized strong connections. The second pass converts F-points to C-points based on the row-wise diagonal dominance of $A_\textrm{ff}$. We find this two-pass CF splitting outperforms common CF splittings available in hypre.
  Furthermore, parallelisation of reduction multigrids in hyperbolic problems is difficult as we require both long-range grid-transfer operators and slow coarsenings (with rates of $\sim$1/2 in both 2D and 3D). We find that good parallel performance in the setup and solve is dependent on several factors: repartitioning the coarse grids, reducing the number of active MPI ranks as we coarsen, truncating the multigrid hierarchy and applying a GMRES polynomial as a coarse-grid solver.
  We compare the performance of two different reduction multigrids, AIRG (that we developed previously) and the hypre implementation of $\ell$AIR. In the streaming limit with AIRG, we demonstrate 81\% weak scaling efficiency in the solve from 2 to 64 nodes (256 to 8196 cores) with only 8.8k unknowns per core, with solve times up to 5.9$\times$ smaller than the $\ell$AIR implementation in hypre.</description>

      <title>InVAErt networks for amortized inference and identifiability analysis of lumped parameter hemodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of cardiovascular model parameters from electronic health records (EHR) poses a significant challenge primarily due to lack of identifiability. Structural non-identifiability arises when a manifold in the space of parameters is mapped to a common output, while practical non-identifiability can result due to limited data, model misspecification, or noise corruption. To address the resulting ill-posed inverse problem, optimization-based or Bayesian inference approaches typically use regularization, thereby limiting the possibility of discovering multiple solutions. In this study, we use inVAErt networks, a neural network-based, data-driven framework for enhanced digital twin analysis of stiff dynamical systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of inVAErt networks in the context of physiological inversion of a six-compartment lumped parameter hemodynamic model from synthetic data to real data with missing components.</description>

      <title>Local divergence-free velocity interpolation for the immersed boundary method using composite B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to improve volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. These delta functions employ tensor product kernels using B-splines, whose polynomial degrees vary in normal and tangential directions based on the corresponding velocity component. Our method addresses the long-standing volume conservation issues in the conventional IB method, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances volume conservation, rivaling the performance of the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method introduced by Bao et al. while maintaining the local nature of the classical IB method. This avoids the computational overhead associated with the DFIB method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves. Numerical experiments show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels can maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We analyze the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with volume conservation errors primarily dominated by the time-stepping scheme's truncation error. This work offers a computationally efficient alternative for improving volume conservation in IB methods, particularly beneficial for large-scale, three-dimensional simulations. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>KAN versus MLP on Irregular or Noisy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues approximation of integral covariance operators with applications to weighted $L^2$ statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the eigenvalues connected to the covariance operator of a centred Hilbert-space valued Gaussian process is genuinely considered a hard problem in several mathematical disciplines. In statistics this problem arises for instance in the asymptotic null distribution of goodness-of-fit test statistics of weighted $L^2$-type. For this problem we present the Rayleigh-Ritz method to approximate the eigenvalues. The usefulness of these approximations is shown by high lightening implications such as critical value approximation and theoretical comparison of test statistics by means of Bahadur efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion for parametric partial differential equation discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged as a promising approach for deriving governing physics when domain knowledge about observed data is limited. Despite recent progress, the identification of governing equations and their parametric dependencies using conventional information criteria remains challenging in noisy situations, as the criteria tend to select overly complex PDEs. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion (UBIC), which is adapted to solve parametric PDE discovery problems efficiently without requiring computationally expensive PDE simulations. This extended UBIC uses quantified PDE uncertainty over different temporal or spatial points to prevent overfitting in model selection. The UBIC is computed with data transformation based on power spectral densities to discover the governing parametric PDE that truly captures qualitative features in frequency space with a few significant terms and their parametric dependencies (i.e., the varying PDE coefficients), evaluated with confidence intervals. Numerical experiments on canonical PDEs demonstrate that our extended UBIC can identify the true number of terms and their varying coefficients accurately, even in the presence of noise. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/parametric-discovery}.</description>

      <title>A randomized algorithm for simultaneously diagonalizing symmetric matrices by congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of symmetric matrices $A_1,\ldots, A_d$ is SDC (simultaneous diagonalization by congruence, also called non-orthogonal joint diagonalization) if there is an invertible matrix $X$ such that every $X^T A_k X$ is diagonal. In this work, a novel randomized SDC (RSDC) algorithm is proposed that reduces SDC to a generalized eigenvalue problem by considering two (random) linear combinations of the family. We establish exact recovery: RSDC achieves diagonalization with probability $1$ if the family is exactly SDC. Under a mild regularity assumption, robust recovery is also established: Given a family that is $\epsilon$-close to SDC then RSDC diagonalizes, with high probability, the family up to an error of norm $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. Under a positive definiteness assumption, which often holds in applications, stronger results are established, including a bound on the condition number of the transformation matrix. For practical use, we suggest to combine RSDC with an optimization algorithm. The performance of the resulting method is verified for synthetic data, image separation and EEG analysis tasks. It turns out that our newly developed method outperforms existing optimization-based methods in terms of efficiency while achieving a comparable level of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02995v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the interest in large language models grows, the importance of accuracy in automatic speech recognition has become more pronounced. This is particularly true for lectures that include specialized terminology, where the success rate of traditional ASR models tends to be low, posing a challenging problem. A method to improve ASR performance for specialized terminology using the word frequency difference approach has been proposed. Through experiments and data analysis, we investigated whether this proposal effectively addressed this issue. In addition, we introduced the power law as the theoretical foundation for the relative frequency methodology mentioned in this approach.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of carbon nanotube (CNT)-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number, Richardson number, Hartmann number, wavy wall peaks, nanoparticle volume fraction, Hartmann angle, rotational speed, and inclination angle, on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. Results reveal that multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluids consistently achieve higher Nusselt numbers than single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanofluids, indicating superior heat transfer capabilities. Introducing a second cylinder and a flow deflector enhances thermal interactions, while increasing Ha stabilizes the flow, improving thermal performance. Wavy wall peaks further enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, SWCNT nanofluids exhibit higher Bejan numbers, indicating a greater dominance of thermal entropy generation over fluid friction. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>
