      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Weighted Constrained Sampling and Weighted Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each world. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In this article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the number of Boolean variables and $\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of $\Omega(1/\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\Theta(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ oracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\Theta(2^n)$, thus achieving a quadratic speedup.</description>

      <title>Intensity correlations in the Wigner representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a compact expression for the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)} (0)$ of a quantum state in terms of its Wigner function, thereby establishing a direct link between $g^{(2)} (0)$ and the state's shape in phase space. We conduct an experiment that simultaneously measures $g^{(2)} (0)$ through direct photocounting and reconstructs the Wigner function via homodyne tomography. The results confirm our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionc and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, providing a platform for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <title>Tomography of parametrized quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum systems is a fundamental task that enables the development of quantum technologies. Various approaches, ranging from full tomography to instances of classical shadows, have been proposed to this end. However, quantum states that are being prepared in practice often involve families of quantum states characterized by continuous parameters, such as the time evolution of a quantum state. In this work, we extend the foundations of quantum state tomography to parametrized quantum states. We introduce a framework that unifies different notions of tomography and use it to establish a natural figure of merit for tomography of parametrized quantum states. Building on this, we provide an explicit algorithm that combines signal processing techniques with a tomography scheme to recover an approximation to the parametrized quantum state equipped with explicit guarantees. Our algorithm uses techniques from compressed sensing to exploit structure in the parameter dependence and operates with a plug and play nature, using the underlying tomography scheme as a black box. In an analogous fashion, we derive a figure of merit that applies to parametrized quantum channels. Substituting the state tomography scheme with a scheme for process tomography in our algorithm, we then obtain a protocol for tomography of parametrized quantum channels. We showcase our algorithm with two examples of shadow tomography of states time-evolved under an NMR Hamiltonian and a free fermionic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum properties in physical systems using proxy witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, it is quite challenging to detect a quantum property, a microscopic property, in a macroscopic system. In our work, we construct general proxy witnesses of quantum properties to detect their presence in quantum systems and we do so for quantum systems which may possibly be large. In particular, we discuss proxy witnesses for quantum properties like unextendibility, quantum coherence, activation, steerability, and entanglement. We apply these proxy witnesses in some widely considered examples of many-body systems, viz., the quantum Heisenberg models, the quantum J1-J2 model.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device agnostic quantum tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of quantum states and devices is paramount to quantum science and technology. The characterization consists of individual measurements, which are required to be precisely known. A mismatch between actual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this characterization. Here, we show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction artifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and quantify the mismatch and gain information about the actual measurement operators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in quantum measurement and state preparation.</description>

      <title>CUAOA: A Novel CUDA-Accelerated Simulation Framework for the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/JFLXB/cuaoa and Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree Tensor Network Operators for Tensor Network Simulations: Applications to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) decompose the system wavefunction to the product of low-rank tensors based on the tree topology, serving as the foundation of the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via thermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty relations in Schwarzschild space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is deemed as one of cornerstones in quantum mechanics, and exploring its lower limit of uncertainty will be helpful to understand the principle's nature. In this study, we propose a generalized entropic uncertainty relation for arbitrary multiple-observable in multipartite system, and further derive a tighter lower bound by considering Holevo quality and mutual information. Importantly, we detailedly discuss the proposed uncertainty relations and quantum coherence in the context of Schwarzschild space-time. It is interesting to find that Hawking radiation will damage the coherence of the physically accessible region and increase the uncertainty. Furthermore, we argue that the properties of the uncertainty in Schwarzschild space-time can be explained from the systems' purity and the information redistribution of the different regions. Therefore, it is believed that our findings provide the generalized entropic uncertainty relations in multipartite systems, which may facilitate us deeper understanding of quantumness and information paradox of the black holes.</description>

      <title>PyTreeNet: A Python Library for easy Utilisation of Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, tree tensor network methods have proven capable of simulating quantum many-body and other high-dimensional systems. This work is a user guide to our Python library PyTreeNet. It includes code examples and exercises to introduce the library's functions and familiarise the reader with the concepts and methods surrounding tree tensor networks. PyTreeNet implements all the tools required to implement general tree tensor network methods, such as tensor decompositions and arbitrary tree structures. The main focus is on the time evolution of quantum systems. This includes an introduction to tree tensor network states and operators and the time-evolving block decimation and time-dependent variational principle. The library's capabilities are showcased with the example of a modified transverse field Ising model on tree structures that go far beyond the ability of common state vector methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental certification of level dynamics in single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emitters of single-photons are essential resources for emerging quantum technologies and developed within different platforms including nonlinear optics, atomic and solid-state systems. The energy level structures of emission processes are critical for reaching and controlling high-quality sources. The most commonly applied test uses a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) setup to determine the emitter energy level structure based on fitting temporal correlations of photon detection events. However, only partial information about the emission process is extracted from such detection, that might be followed by an inconclusive fitting of the data. This process predetermines our limited ability to quantify and understand the dynamics in the photon emission process that are of importance for the applications in communication, sensing and computing. In this work, we present a complete analysis based on all normalized coincidences between detection and no-detection events recorded in the same HBT setup to certify expected properties of an emitted photonic state. As a proof of concept we apply our methodology to single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, in which case the certification conclusively rejects a model based on a two-level emitter that radiates a photonic states mixed with any classical noise background.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Stabilization of Entanglement via Engineered Dissipation in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation and preservation of quantum entanglement are among the primary tasks in quantum information processing. State stabilization via quantum bath engineering offers a resource-efficient approach to achieve this objective. However, current methods for engineering dissipative channels to stabilize target entangled states often require specialized hardware designs, complicating experimental realization and hindering their compatibility with scalable quantum computation architectures. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a stabilization protocol readily implementable in the mainstream integrated superconducting quantum circuits. The approach utilizes a Raman process involving a resonant (or nearly resonant) superconducting qubit array and their dedicated readout resonators to effectively emerge nonlocal dissipative channels. Leveraging individual controllability of the qubits and resonators, the protocol stabilizes two-qubit Bell states with a fidelity of $90.7\%$, marking the highest reported value in solid-state platforms to date. Furthermore, by extending this strategy to include three qubits, an entangled $W$ state is achieved with a fidelity of $86.2\%$, which has not been experimentally investigated before. Notably, the protocol is of practical interest since it only utilizes existing hardware common to standard operations in the underlying superconducting circuits, thereby facilitating the exploration of many-body quantum entanglement with dissipative resources.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement versus Multiparticle Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is defined as presence of quantum correlations beyond those achieved by local action and classical communication. To identify its presence in a generic state, one can, for example, check for existence of a decomposition of separable states. A natural extension is a genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), understood as nonexistenence of a decomposition into biseparable states (later called biseparable decomposition, BD). In this contribution we revisit activation of GME. We discuss few examples of states, which are decomposable into a mixture of biproduct states. However, after merging two copies of these states, we certify nonexistence of BD with witness operators. This seems to challenge our understanding of GME as a separate resource. It turns out that it requires a careful consideration of the physical context. We stress that activation of GME from multiple copies of GME-free states necessarily involves entangling operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monogamy of entanglement is the fundamental property of quantum systems. By using two new entanglement measures based on dual entropy, the $S^{t}$-entropy entanglement and $T^{t}_q$-entropy entanglement measures, we present the general monogamy relations in multi-qubit quantum systems. We show that these newly derived monogamy inequalities are tighter than the existing ones. Based on these general monogamy relations, we construct the set of multipartite entanglement indicators for $N$-qubit states, which are shown to work well even for the cases that the usual concurrence-based indicators do not work. Detailed examples are presented to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Exploiting nonequilibrium phase transitions and strong symmetries for continuous measurement of collective observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative many-body quantum dynamics can feature strong symmetries which give rise to conserved quantities. We discuss here how a strong symmetry in conjunction with a nonequilibrium phase transition allows to devise a protocol for measuring collective many-body observables. To demonstrate this idea we consider a collective spin system whose constituents are governed by a dissipative dynamics that conserves the total angular momentum. We show that by continuously monitoring the system output the value of the total angular momentum can be inferred directly from the time-integrated emission signal, without the need of repeated projective measurements or reinitializations of the spins. This may offer a route towards the measurement of collective properties in qubit ensembles, with applications in quantum tomography, quantum computation and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Precision bounds for quantum phase estimation using two-mode squeezed Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation based on Gaussian states plays a crucial role in many application fields. In this paper, we study the precision bound for the scheme using two-mode squeezed Gaussian states. The quantum Fisher information is calculated and its maximization is used to determine the optimal parameters. We find that two single-mode squeezed vacuum states are the optimal inputs and the corresponding precision bound is superior to the Heisenberg limit by a factor of 2. For practical purposes, we consider the effects originating from photon loss. The precision bound can still outperform the shot-noise limit when the lossy rate is below 0.4. Our work may demonstrate a significant and promising step towards practical quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mechanisms for Quantum Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, centralized differential privacy has been successfully extended to quantum computing and information processing to safeguard privacy and prevent leaks in neighboring relationships of quantum states. This paper introduces a framework known as quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) and initializes the algorithmic study of QLDP. QLDP utilizes a parameter $\epsilon$ to manage privacy leaks and ensure the privacy of individual quantum states. The optimization of the QLDP value $\epsilon$, denoted as $\epsilon^*$, for any quantum mechanism is addressed as an optimization problem. The introduction of quantum noise is shown to provide privacy protections similar to classical scenarios, with quantum depolarizing noise identified as the optimal unital privatization mechanism within the QLDP framework. Unital mechanisms represent a diverse set of quantum mechanisms that encompass frequently employed quantum noise types. Quantum depolarizing noise optimizes both fidelity and trace distance utilities, which are crucial metrics in the field of quantum computation and information, and can be viewed as a quantum counterpart to classical randomized response methods. Additionally, a composition theorem is presented for the application of QLDP framework in distributed (spatially separated) quantum systems, ensuring the validity (additivity of QLDP value) irrespective of the states' independence, classical correlation, or entanglement (quantum correlation). The study further explores the trade-off between utility and privacy across different quantum noise mechanisms, including unital and non-unital quantum noise mechanisms, through both analytical and numerically experimental approaches. Meanwhile, this highlights the optimization of quantum depolarizing noise in QLDP framework.</description>

      <title>A Construction of Quantum Stabilizer Codes from Classical Codes and Butson Hadamard Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a constructive proof to show that if there exist a classical linear code C is a subset of F_q^n of dimension k and a classical linear code D is a subset of F_q^k^m of dimension s, where q is a power of a prime number p, then there exists an [[nm, ks, d]]_q quantum stabilizer code with d determined by C and D by identifying the stabilizer group of the code. In the construction, we use a particular type of Butson Hadamard matrices equivalent to multiple Kronecker products of the Fourier matrix of order p. We also consider the same construction of a quantum code for a general normalized Butson Hadamard matrix and search for a condition for the quantum code to be a stabilizer code.</description>

      <title>Experimental Sample-Efficient and Device-Independent GHZ State Certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The certification of quantum resources is a critical tool in the development of quantum information processing. In particular, quantum state verification is a fundamental building block for communication and computation applications, determining whether the involved parties can trust the resources at hand or whether the application should be aborted. Self-testing methods have been used to tackle such verification tasks in a device-independent (DI) setting. However, these approaches commonly consider the limit of large (asymptotic), identically and independently distributed (IID) samples, which weakens the DI claim and poses serious challenges to their experimental implementation. Here we overcome these challenges by adopting a theoretical protocol enabling the certification of quantum states in the few-copies and non-IID regime and by leveraging a high-fidelity multipartite entangled photon source. This allows us to show the efficient and device-independent certification of a single copy of a four-qubit GHZ state that can readily be used for the robust and reliable implementation of quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>VeriQR: A Robustness Verification Tool for Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial noise attacks present a significant threat to quantum machine learning (QML) models, similar to their classical counterparts. This is especially true in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, where noise is unavoidable. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the robustness of QML models before their deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce \textit{VeriQR}, the first tool designed specifically for formally verifying and improving the robustness of QML models, to the best of our knowledge. This tool mimics real-world quantum hardware's noisy impacts by incorporating random noise to formally validate a QML model's robustness. \textit{VeriQR} supports exact (sound and complete) algorithms for both local and global robustness verification. For enhanced efficiency, it implements an under-approximate (complete) algorithm and a tensor network-based algorithm to verify local and global robustness, respectively. As a formal verification tool, \textit{VeriQR} can detect adversarial examples and utilize them for further analysis and to enhance the local robustness through adversarial training, as demonstrated by experiments on real-world quantum machine learning models. Moreover, it permits users to incorporate customized noise. Based on this feature, we assess \textit{VeriQR} using various real-world examples, and experimental outcomes confirm that the addition of specific quantum noise can enhance the global robustness of QML models. These processes are made accessible through a user-friendly graphical interface provided by \textit{VeriQR}, catering to general users without requiring a deep understanding of the counter-intuitive probabilistic nature of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage tomography based on eigenanalysis for high-dimensional dense unitary quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying, i.e. estimating, a quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we aim at developing QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, i.e. that use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated by means of simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods first yield the following results. Just running them with standard PC and software already makes it possible to evaluate their performance for up to 13 qubits, i.e. with state space dimensions up to a few thousands. This shows their attractiveness in terms of accuracy and proves that they solve the core of the dense QPT problem in a very limited time frame. For other test results, see the paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel path-slicing strategies integrated with quantum local search to optimize solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), addressing the limitations of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies. Our hybrid quantum-classical approach leverages classical path initialization and quantum optimization to effectively manage the computational challenges posed by the TSP. We explore various path slicing methods, including k-means and anti-k-means clustering, to divide the TSP into manageable subproblems. These are then solved using quantum or classical solvers. Our analysis, performed on multiple TSP instances from the TSPlib, demonstrates the ability of our strategies to achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently, highlighting significant improvements in solving efficiency and resource utilization. This approach paves the way for future applications in larger combinatorial optimization scenarios, advancing the field of quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computing: Realizing Quantum Shannon Theory With Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit-field quantum transduction provides numerous advantages to quantum computing, such as device-specific error-correcting codes, efficient scalability, and effective entanglement generation. An all-to-all connected bus of qubits implanted around the outside of a topological insulator, allowed to interact with the edge state, is a promising arena for transduction with flying fermionic qubits. Unruh--DeWitt detectors have allowed quantum information scientists to model entanglement properties of qubit-field interactions in many settings in a field known as Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). Unruh--DeWitt detectors are useful tools to realize quantum Shannon theory, a subset of the theory of quantum communication, in condensed matter systems, aptly named Unruh--DeWitt quantum computers. These systems will provide quantitative measurements of communication in quantum materials that utilize coherent states for bosonic and fermionic fields. In this thesis, emphasis is placed on the well-studied theory of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, as the bosonization of a helical Luttinger liquid provides a pedagogical arena to construct RQI channels of fermionic systems. Multiple experimentally realizable systems are proposed, and design constraints are constructed to ensure maximum channel capacity. Furthermore, we elucidate the strength of these quantum channels using measurements from quantum Shannon theory such as coherent information, dephasing formalism, diamond distance and universality of Unruh--DeWitt quantum logic gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing (DQS) leverages quantum resources to estimate an unknown global property of a networked quantum sensor beyond the classical limit. We propose and analyze an all-optical resource-efficient scheme for the next-generation DQS systems. Our method utilizes phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifiers and linear interferometers and achieves the sensitivity close to the optimal limit, as determined by the quantum Fisher information of the entangled resource state. Furthermore, it utilizes high-gain OPA-assisted detection, offering critical advantages of increased bandwidth and loss tolerance, in contrast to conventional methods employing balanced homodyne detection (BHD). We show the efficacy of our proposal for displacement sensing and show its loss tolerance against high levels of photon loss, thus circumventing the major obstacle in current BHD-based approaches. Our architectural analysis shows that our scheme can be realized with current quantum photonic technology</description>

      <title>Systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians via quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel, systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians in order to solve field theory problems within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism via quantum computing. We present our discussion of this input scheme based on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory. In our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register encodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the boson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique combinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for these unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the many-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. We demonstrate our input scheme by solving the low-lying spectra of the Hamiltonian utilizing the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. We can incorporate the input scheme in this work with the input scheme for many-fermion Hamiltonians; they jointly offer new pathways to solving the structure and dynamics of field theory problems on future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Superresolving optical ruler based on spatial mode demultiplexing for systems evolving under Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of superresolution techniques, i.e., allowing for efficient resolution below the Rayleigh limit, became one of the important branches in contemporary optics and metrology. Recent findings show that perfect spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) into Hermite-Gauss modes followed by photon counting enables one to reach the quantum limit of precision in the task of estimation of separation between two weak stationary sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime. In order to check the limitations of the method, various imperfections such as misalignment or crosstalk between the modes were considered.
  Possible applications of the method in microscopy call for the adaptive measurement scheme, as the position of the measured system can evolve in time, causing non-negligible misalignment. In this paper, we examine the impact of Brownian motion of the center of the system of two weak incoherent sources of arbitrary relative brightness on adaptive SPADE measurement precision limits. The analysis is carried out using Fisher information, from which the limit of precision can be obtained by Cram\'er-Rao bound. As a result, we find that Rayleigh's curse is present in such a scenario; however, SPADE measurement can outperform perfect direct imaging. What is more, a suitable adjustment of the measurement time between alignments allows measurement with near-optimal precision.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are induced by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-induced edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of spinful fermionic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the fermionic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (fermionic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-induced edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms exquisitely controlled by lasers are the quantum foundation, particularly for sensing, timekeeping, and computing, of state-of-the-art quantum science and technology. However, the laboratory-scale infrastructure for such optical-atomic quantum apparatuses rarely translates into commercial applications. A promising solution is miniaturizing the optical layouts onto a chip-scale device integrated with cold atoms inside a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. For prototyping purposes, however, rapidly loading or exchanging test photonic devices into a UHV chamber is limited by the evacuation time from atmospheric pressures to the optimal pressures for ultracold atoms of $1\times10^{-11}$ Torr, a process typically taking weeks or months without cryogenics. Here, we present a loadlock apparatus and loading procedure capable of venting, exchanging, and evacuating back to $&lt;1\times10^{-11}$ Torr in under 24 hours. Our system allows for rapid testing and benchmarking of various photonic devices with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>A BCS state formulation for the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative expression for the ground state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of fermion chain in double-scaled SYK and power spectrum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity of the fermion chain operator which consists of multiple Majorana fermions in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with finite temperature. Using the fact that Krylov complexity is computable from two-point functions, the analysis is performed in the limit where the two-point function becomes simple and we compare the results with those of other previous studies. We confirm the exponential growth of Krylov complexity in the very low temperature regime. In general, Krylov complexity grows at most linearly at very late times in any system with a bounded energy spectrum. Therefore, we have to focus on the initial growth to see differences in the behaviors of systems or operators. Since the DSSYK model is such a bounded system, its chaotic nature can be expected to appear as the initial exponential growth of the Krylov complexity. In particular, the time at which the initial exponential growth of Krylov complexity terminates is independent of the number of degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we systematically and specifically study the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using a toy power spectrum and deepen our understanding of those initial behaviors. In particular, we confirm that the overall sech-like behavior of the power spectrum shows the initial linear growth of the Lanczos coefficient, even when the energy spectrum is bounded.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>

Abstract: Many-body systems which saturate the quantum bound on chaos are attracting interest across a wide range of fields. Notable examples include the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variations, all characterised by some form or randomness and all to all couplings. Here we study many-body quantum chaos in a quantum impurity model showing Non-Fermi-Liquid physics, the overscreened multichannel $SU(N)$ Kondo model. We compute exactly the low-temperature behavior of the out-of time order correlator in the limit of large $N$ and large number of channels $K$, at fixed ratio $\gamma=K/N$. Due to strong correlations at the impurity site the spin fractionalizes in auxiliary fermions and bosons. We show that all the degrees of freedom of our theory acquire a Lyapunov exponent which is linear in temperature as $T\rightarrow 0$, with a prefactor that depends on $\gamma$. Remarkably, for $N=K$ the impurity spin displays maximal chaos, while bosons and fermions only get up to half of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Our results highlights two new features: a non-disordered model which is maximally chaotic due to strong correlations at its boundary and a fractionalization of quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to probe a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) with Josephson Junction Switching Current Detector (JJSCD). The sensitivity for the shear can reach $h\simeq 10^{-19}$ realistically, $10^{-21}$ in the near future, $10^{-24}$ optimistically. If we utilize the enhancement factor from the ratio of the frequency, it is possible to reach further below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. It will be interesting if we can access the region to discover a footprint of new physics.</description>

      <title>Can dissipation induce a transition between many-body localized and thermal states?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in many-body systems. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we demonstrate the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau's theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound, and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we observe the shape of the quasiparticle excitations directly from momentum-space tomography and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau's theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.</description>

Abstract: Identifying phases of matter presents considerable challenges, particularly within the domain of quantum theory, where the complexity of ground states appears to increase exponentially with system size. Quantum many-body systems exhibit an array of complex entanglement structures spanning distinct phases. Although extensive research has explored the relationship between quantum phase transitions and quantum entanglement, establishing a direct, pragmatic connection between them remains a critical challenge. In this work, we present a novel and efficient quantum phase transition classifier, utilizing disentanglement with reinforcement learning-optimized variational quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on quantum phase transitions in the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Moreover, we observe the algorithm's ability to learn the Kramers-Wannier duality pertaining to entanglement structures in the TFIM. Our approach not only identifies phase transitions based on the performance of the disentangling circuits but also exhibits impressive scalability, facilitating its application in larger and more complex quantum systems. This study sheds light on the characterization of quantum phases through the entanglement structures inherent in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Is the dynamical quantum Cheshire cat detectable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how one might detect the dynamical quantum Cheshire cat proposed by Aharonov et al. We show that, in practice, we need to bias the initial state by adding/subtracting a small probability amplitude (`field') of the orthogonal state, which travels with the disembodied property, to make the effect detectable (i.e. if our initial state is $|\uparrow_z\rangle$, we need to bias this with some small amount $\delta$ of state $|\downarrow_z\rangle$). This biasing, which can be done either directly or via weakly entangling the state with a pointer, effectively provides a phase reference with which we can measure the evolution of the state. The outcome can then be measured as a small probability difference in detections in a mutually unbiased basis, proportional to this biasing $\delta$. We show this is different from counterfactual communication, which provably does not require any probe field to travel between sender Bob and receiver Alice for communication. We further suggest an optical polarisation experiment where these phenomena might be demonstrated in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Classical product code constructions for quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several notions of code products are known in quantum error correction, such as hyper-graph products, homological products, lifted products, balanced products, to name a few. In this paper we introduce a new product code construction which is a natural generalisation of classical product codes to quantum codes: starting from a set of component Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a larger CSS code is obtained where both $X$ parity checks and $Z$ parity checks are associated to classical product codes. We deduce several properties of product CSS codes from the properties of the component codes, including bounds to the code distance, and show that built-in redundancies in the parity checks result in so-called meta-checks which can be exploited to correct syndrome read-out errors. We then specialise to the case of single-parity-check (SPC) product codes which in the classical domain are a common choice for constructing product codes. Logical error rate simulations of a SPC $3$-fold product CSS code having parameters $[[512,174,8]]$ are shown under both a maximum likelihood decoder for the erasure channel and belief propagation decoding for depolarising noise. We compare the results with other codes of comparable length and dimension, including a code from the family of asymptotically good Tanner codes. We observe that our reference product CSS code outperforms all the other examined codes.</description>

      <title>Programmable adiabatic demagnetization for systems with trivial and topological excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple, robust protocol to prepare a low-energy state of an arbitrary Hamiltonian on a quantum computer or programmable quantum simulator. The protocol is inspired by the adiabatic demagnetization technique, used to cool solid-state systems to extremely low temperatures. A fraction of the qubits (or spins) is used to model a spin bath that is coupled to the system. By an adiabatic ramp down of a simulated Zeeman field acting on the bath spins, energy and entropy are extracted from the system. The bath spins are then measured and reset to the polarized state, and the process is repeated until convergence to a low-energy steady state is achieved. We demonstrate the protocol via application to the quantum Ising model. We study the protocol's performance in the presence of noise and show how the information from the measurement of the bath spins can be used to monitor the cooling process. The performance of the algorithm depends on the nature of the excitations of the system; systems with non-local (topological) excitations are more difficult to cool than those with local excitations. We explore the possible mitigation of this problem by trapping topological excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale variational quantum algorithms are widely recognized as a potential pathway to achieve practical quantum advantages. However, the presence of quantum noise might suppress and undermine these advantages, which blurs the boundaries of classical simulability. To gain further clarity on this matter, we present a novel polynomial-scale method based on the path integral of observable's back-propagation on Pauli paths (OBPPP). This method efficiently approximates expectation values of operators in variational quantum algorithms with bounded truncation error in the presence of single-qubit Pauli noise. Theoretically, we rigorously prove: 1) For a constant minimal non-zero noise rate $\gamma$, OBPPP's time and space complexity exhibit a polynomial relationship with the number of qubits $n$, the circuit depth $L$. 2) For variable $\gamma$, in scenarios where more than two non-zero noise factors exist, the complexity remains $\mathrm{Poly}\left(n,L\right)$ if $\gamma$ exceeds $1/\log{L}$, but grows exponential with $L$ when $\gamma$ falls below $1/L$. Numerically, we conduct classical simulations of IBM's zero-noise extrapolated experimental results on the 127-qubit Eagle processor [Nature \textbf{618}, 500 (2023)]. Our method attains higher accuracy and faster runtime compared to the quantum device. Furthermore, our approach allows us to simulate noisy outcomes, enabling accurate reproduction of IBM's unmitigated results that directly correspond to raw experimental observations. Our research reveals the vital role of noise in classical simulations and the derived method is general in computing the expected value for a broad class of quantum circuits and can be applied in the verification of quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks with multiple sources allow the observation of quantum nonlocality without inputs. Consequently, the incompatibility of measurements is not a necessity for observing quantum nonlocality when one has access to multiple quantum sources. Here we investigate the minimal scenario without inputs where one can observe any form of quantum nonlocality. We show that even two parties with two sources that might be classically correlated can witness a form of quantum nonlocality, in particular quantum steering, in networks without inputs if one of the parties is trusted, that is, performs a fixed known measurement. We term this effect as swap-steering. The scenario presented in this work is minimal to observe such an effect. Consequently, a scenario exists where one can observe quantum steering but not Bell non-locality. We further construct a linear witness to observe swap-steering. Interestingly, this witness enables self-testing of the quantum states generated by the sources and the local measurement of the untrusted party. This in turn allows certifying two bits of randomness that can be obtained from the measurement outcomes of the untrusted device without the requirement of initially feeding the device with randomness.</description>

Abstract: Typically, fault-tolerant operations and code concatenation are reserved for quantum error correction due to their resource overhead. Here, we show that fault tolerant operations have a large impact on the performance of symmetry based error mitigation techniques. We also demonstrate that similar to results in fault tolerant quantum computing, code concatenation in fault-tolerant quantum error mitigation (FTQEM) can exponentially suppress the errors to arbitrary levels. For a family of circuits, we provide analytical error thresholds for FTQEM with the repetition code. These circuits include a set of quantum circuits that can generate all of reversible classical computing. The post-selection rate in FTQEM can also be increased by correcting some of the outcomes. Our threshold results can also be viewed from the perspective of quantifying the number of gate operations we can delay checking the stabilizers in a concatenated code before errors overwhelm the encoding. The benefits of FTQEM are demonstrated with numerical simulations and hardware demonstrations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a nonperturbative method for solving eigenproblems. This method applies to almost all potentials and provides nonperturbative approximations for any energy level. The method converts an eigenproblem into a perturbation problem, obtains perturbation solutions through standard perturbation theory, and then analytically continues the perturbative solution into a nonperturbative solution. Concretely, we follow three main steps: (1) Introduce an auxiliary potential that can be solved exactly and treat the potential to be solved as a perturbation on this auxiliary system. (2) Use perturbation theory to obtain an approximate polynomial of the eigenproblem. (3) Use a rational approximation to analytically continue this approximate polynomial into the nonperturbative region.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum information theory-inspired method to improve the characterization of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum devices. We design a new class of similarity transformations that, when applied as a preprocessing step, can substantially simplify a Hamiltonian for subsequent analysis on quantum hardware. By design, these transformations can be identified and applied efficiently using purely classical resources. In practice, these transformations allow us to shorten requisite physical circuit-depths, overcoming constraints imposed by imperfect near-term hardware. Importantly, the quality of our transformations is tunable: we define a 'ladder' of transformations that yields increasingly simple Hamiltonians at the cost of more classical computation. Using quantum chemistry as a benchmark application, we demonstrate that our protocol leads to significant performance improvements for zero and finite temperature free energy calculations on both digital and analog quantum hardware. Specifically, our energy estimates not only outperform traditional Hartree-Fock solutions, but this performance gap also consistently widens as we tune up the quality of our transformations. In short, our quantum information-based approach opens promising new pathways to realizing useful and feasible quantum chemistry algorithms on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Universal framework for simultaneous tomography of quantum states and SPAM noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15648v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general denoising algorithm for performing simultaneous tomography of quantum states and measurement noise. This algorithm allows us to fully characterize state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors present in any quantum system. Our method is based on the analysis of the properties of the linear operator space induced by unitary operations. Given any quantum system with a noisy measurement apparatus, our method can output the quantum state and the noise matrix of the detector up to a single gauge degree of freedom. We show that this gauge freedom is unavoidable in the general case, but this degeneracy can be generally broken using prior knowledge on the state or noise properties, thus fixing the gauge for several types of state-noise combinations with no assumptions about noise strength. Such combinations include pure quantum states with arbitrarily correlated errors, and arbitrary states with block independent errors. This framework can further use available prior information about the setting to systematically reduce the number of observations and measurements required for state and noise detection. Our method effectively generalizes existing approaches to the problem, and includes as special cases common settings considered in the literature requiring an uncorrelated or invertible noise matrix, or specific probe states.</description>

      <title>Tsirelson inequalities: Detecting cheating and quantumness in a single framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantumness refers to the peculiar and counterintuitive characteristics exhibited by quantum systems. Tsirelson inequalities have emerged as a powerful tool in quantum theory to detect quantumness and entanglement of harmonic oscillators, spins undergoing uniform precession, and anharmonic systems. In this paper we harness the versatility of Tsirelson inequalities to address two distinct problems: detecting cheating in classic shell games and probing quantumness in spatially separated systems and harmonic oscillators. By adopting a black-box approach and a geometric characterization of the space of conditional probabilities, we demonstrate that Tsirelson inequalities can be used in both scenarios, enabling us to uncover quantum signatures and identify cheaters in a single unified framework. This connection provides an intuitive different perspective on quantumness of mechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address how one can empirically infer properties of quantum states generated by dynamics involving measurements. Our focus is on many-body settings where the number of measurements is extensive, making brute-force approaches based on postselection intractable due to their exponential sample complexity. We introduce a general-purpose scheme that can be used to infer any property of the post-measurement ensemble of states (e.g. the average entanglement entropy, or frame potential) using a scalable number of experimental repetitions. We first identify a general class of estimable properties that can be directly extracted from experimental data. Then, based on empirical observations of such quantities, we show how one can indirectly infer information about any particular given non-estimable quantity of interest through classical post-processing. Our approach is based on an optimization task, where one asks what are the minimum and maximum values that the desired quantity could possibly take, while ensuring consistency with observations. The true value of this quantity must then lie within a feasible range between these extrema, resulting in two-sided bounds. Narrow feasible ranges can be obtained by using a classical simulation of the device to determine which estimable properties one should measure. Even in cases where this simulation is inaccurate, unambiguous information about the true value of a given quantity realised on the quantum device can be learned. As an immediate application, we show that our method can be used to verify the emergence of quantum state designs in experiments. We identify some fundamental obstructions that in some cases prevent sharp knowledge of a given quantity from being inferred, and discuss what can be learned in cases where classical simulation is too computationally demanding to be feasible.</description>

      <title>Certifying ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size, variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success, rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy. However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models. To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in a scalable way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy extraction from quantum sources is a key task to develop new quantum devices such as quantum batteries (QB). In this context, one of the main figures of merit is the ergotropy, which measures the maximal amount of energy (as work) that can be extracted from the quantum source by means of unitary operations. One of the main issues to fully extract energy from the quantum source is the assumption that any unitary operation can be done on the system. This assumption, in general, fails in practice since the operations that can be done are limited and depend on the quantum hardware (experimental platform) one has available. In this work, we propose an approach to optimize the extractable energy inspired by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In this approach, we explicitly take into account a limited set of unitaries by using the hardware efficient asatz (HEA) class of parameterized quantum circuits. As a QB we use an one-dimensional spin chain described by a family of paradigmatic first neighbor Hamiltonians such as the $XXX$,$XXZ$, $XYZ$, $XX$, $XY$ and transverse Ising models. By building our parameterized quantum circuits assuming that different types of connectivity may be available depending on the quantum hardware, we numerically compare the efficiency of work extraction for each model. Our results show that the best efficiency is generally obtained with quantum circuits that have connectivity between first neighbor spins.</description>

      <title>On the Pauli Spectrum of QAC0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years.
  In this work, we identify a notion of the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum of classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits satisfies low-degree concentration, in analogy to the famous Linial, Nisan, Mansour theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits cannot compute parity.
  We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-$d$, polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with at most $n^{O(1/d)}$ auxiliary qubits. We obtain new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications: this class of circuits cannot correctly compute
  - the $n$-bit parity function on more than $(\frac{1}{2} + 2^{-\Omega(n^{1/d})})$-fraction of inputs, and
  - the $n$-bit majority function on more than $(1 - \Omega(n^{-1/2}))$-fraction of inputs.
  Additionally we show that this class of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity, giving the first learning result for $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits.
  More broadly, our results add evidence that "Pauli-analytic" techniques can be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is a key challenge for the development of practical quantum computers, a direction in which significant experimental progress has been made in recent years. In solid-state qubits, one of the leading information loss mechanisms is dephasing, usually modelled by phase flip errors. Here, we introduce quasistatic phase damping, a more subtle error model which describes the effect of Larmor frequency fluctuations due to 1/f noise. We show how this model is different from a simple phase flip error model, in terms of multi-cycle error correction. Considering the surface code, we provide numerical evidence for an error threshold, in the presence of quasistatic phase damping and readout errors. We discuss the implications of our results for spin qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e., entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare critical quantum sensing to passive quantum strategies to perform frequency estimation, in the case of single-mode quadratic Hamiltonians. We show that, while in the unitary case both strategies achieve precision scaling quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the exceptional point or beyond threshold provides sub-optimal performance. This critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons, in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are not negligible. Our results are applicable to a broad variety of critical sensors whose phenomenology can be reduced to that of a single-mode quadratic Hamiltonian, including systems described by finite-component and fully-connected models.</description>

Abstract: We analyze how the presence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) characterizing a time machine can be discerned by placing a local particle detector in a region of spacetime which is causally disconnected from the CTCs. Our study shows that not only can the detector tell if there are CTCs, but also that the detector can separate topological from geometrical information and distinguish periodic spacetimes without CTCs (like the Einstein cylinder), curvature, and spacetimes with topological identifications that enable time-machines.</description>

Abstract: We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry. The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a 2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial, hamiltonian limit $H_{\gamma}$ in closed form. We find that the fermionic symmetry pins $H_{\gamma}$ to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore quench dynamics for this class of circuits.</description>

Abstract: Sponge hashing is a widely used class of cryptographic hash algorithms which underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of invertible permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem.
  In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the "double-sided zero-search" conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint' 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random $2n$-bit permutation requires at least $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries -- and this is tight due to Grover's algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel "symmetrization argument" which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random oracle model.</description>

      <title>QestOptPOVM: An iterative algorithm to find optimal measurements for quantum parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation holds significant promise for achieving high precision through the utilization of the most informative measurements. While various lower bounds have been developed to assess the best accuracy for estimates, they are not tight, nor provide a construction of the optimal measurement in general. Thus, determining the explicit forms of optimal measurements has been challenging due to the non-trivial optimization. In this study, we introduce an algorithm, termed QestOptPOVM, designed to directly identify optimal positive operator-valued measure (POVM) using the steepest descent method. Through rigorous testing on several examples for multiple copies of qubit states (up to six copies), we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed algorithm. Moreover, a comparative analysis between numerical results and established lower bounds serves to validate the tightness of the Nagaoka-Hayashi bound in finite-sample quantum metrology for our examples. Concurrently, our algorithm functions as a tool for elucidating the explicit forms of optimal POVMs, thereby enhancing our understanding of quantum parameter estimation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Entanglement Generation via Casimir-Polder Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of $\sim25$ nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in entanglement generation by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-induced gauge fields in neutral atoms serve as a means of mimicking the effects of a magnetic field, providing researchers with a platform to explore behaviors analogous to those observed in condensed matter systems under real magnetic fields. Here, we propose a method to generate chiral motion in atomic excitations within the neutral atomic ground-state manifolds. This is achieved through the application of polychromatic driving fields coupled to the ground-Rydberg transition, along with unconventional Rydberg pumping. The scheme offers the advantage of arbitrary adjustment of the effective magnetic flux by setting the relative phases between different external laser fields. Additionally, the effective interaction strength between the atomic ground states can be maintained at 10 kHz, surpassing the capabilities of the previous approach utilizing Floquet modulation. Notably, the proposed method can be readily extended to implement a hexagonal neutral atom lattice, serving as the fundamental unit in realizing the Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Free Binary Decision Diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computation to prepare a quantum state for a given classical description of the quantum state. The classical description of an $n$-qubit quantum state may have $\exp(O(n))$ parameters in general, which are inherently inefficient to deal with in the worst case; however, in many practical cases, we may be able to employ suitable data structures to represent such large-scale data in a compressed way, e.g., by using a free binary decision diagram (FBDD), a rooted directed acyclic graph with two terminal nodes to concisely represent a Boolean function. We here construct a quantum algorithm for QSP when the classical description of a quantum state is given by an FBDD with weighted edges, and analyze the space, and time complexity of QSP in this setting. We provide a nontrivial example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ nodes rather than $\mathrm{exp}(O(n))$. We show that any quantum state represented by the weighted FBDD with $N$ nodes can be prepared by an $O(N)$-sized quantum circuit using $N$ ancillary qubits, exponentially improving the required circuit size for QSP compared to other BDD-based QSPs. We also provide another example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(n^2)$ nodes, and $O(n^2)$ ancillary qubits, but cannot be prepared efficiently by a QSP based on the amplitude amplification. These results provide techniques to employ FBDDs as a tool for broadening the possibility of efficient QSP.</description>

      <title>Decoherence without einselection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in a quantum measurement is typically explained as an interaction with the environment that destroys coherence between the system's eigenstates, a phenomenon known as environment-induced superselection (einselection). In this work, we demonstrate that einselection and the associated envariance are actually artifacts resulting from neglecting the non-equilibrium dynamics of the apparatus. We propose a new formalism of operator dressing, which we call the stochastic matrix integral (SMI), inspired by recent developments in quantum gravity algebras. This approach naturally arises from a modified Page-Wootters (PW) formula and describes decoherence as an interacting non-equilibrium process. It leads to the reduction of the Hilbert space and the emergence of an intrinsic non-unitary process as well as Born's rule. These outcomes are achieved without relying on the assumptions of einselection and pointer basis.</description>

      <title>Parameter Generation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a compelling prospect for revolutionizing the field of combinatorial optimization, in virtue of the unique attributes of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, stands out as leading proposals to efficiently solve the Max-Cut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its promised advantages strongly rely on parameters initialization strategy, a critical aspect due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by low-quality local minima issues. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task in which the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to generate high-performing initial parameters for QAOA. The diffusion model is capable of learning the distribution of high-performing parameters and then synthesizing new parameters closer to optimal ones. Experiments with various sized Max-Cut problem instances demonstrate that our diffusion process consistently enhances QAOA effectiveness compared to random parameters initialization. Moreover, our framework indicates the capacity of training on small, classically simulatable problem instances, aiming at extrapolating to larger instances to reduce quantum computational resource overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Merlin-Arthur (MA) automata where Merlin provides a certificate at the beginning of computation and it is scanned by Arthur before reading the input. We define Merlin-Arthur deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum finite state automata (resp., MA-DFAs, MA-PFAs, and MA-QFAs) and postselecting MA-PFAs and MA-QFAs (resp., MA-PostPFA and MA-PostQFA). We present several results using different certificate lengths.
  We show that MA-DFAs use constant length certificates, and they are equivalent to multi-entry DFAs. Thus, they recognize all and only regular languages, but they can be exponential and polynomial state efficient over binary and unary languages, respectively. With sublinear length certificates, MA-PFAs can recognize several nonstochastic unary languages with cutpoint 1/2. With linear length certificates, MA-PostPFAs can recognize these nonstochastic unary languages with bounded error. With arbitrarily long certificates, bounded-error MA-PostPFAs can verify every unary decidable language. With sublinear length certificates, bounded-error MA-PostQFAs can verify several nonstochastic unary languages. With linear length certificates, they can verify every unary language and some NP-complete binary languages. With exponential length certificates, they can verify every binary language.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: We present a digitization scheme for the lattice $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory Hamiltonian in the $\mathit{magnetic}$ $\mathit{basis}$, where the gauge links are unitary and diagonal. The digitization is obtained from a particular partitioning of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ group manifold, with the canonical momenta constructed by an approximation of the Lie derivatives on this partitioning. This construction, analogous to a discrete Fourier transform, preserves the spectrum of the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian and the canonical commutation relations exactly on a subspace of the truncated Hilbert space, while the residual subspace can be projected above the cutoff of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.</description>

      <title>Vison condensation and spinon confinement in a kagome-lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid: A numerical study of a quantum dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin-liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model [Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015)] by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>

Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>

Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>
