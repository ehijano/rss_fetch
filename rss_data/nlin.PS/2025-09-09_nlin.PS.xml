      <title>\texttt{simple-idealized-1d-nlse}: Pseudo-Spectral Solver for the 1D Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python implementation of an idealized high-order pseudo-spectral solver for the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). The solver combines Fourier spectral spatial discretization with an adaptive eighth-order Dormand-Prince time integration scheme to achieve machine-precision conservation of mass and near-perfect preservation of momentum and energy for smooth solutions. The implementation accurately reproduces fundamental NLSE phenomena including soliton collisions with analytically predicted phase shifts, Akhmediev breather dynamics, and the development of modulation instability from noisy initial conditions. Four canonical test cases validate the numerical scheme: single soliton propagation, two-soliton elastic collision, breather evolution, and noise-seeded modulation instability. The solver employs a 2/3 dealiasing rule with exponential filtering to prevent aliasing errors from the cubic nonlinearity. Statistical analysis using Shannon, R\'enyi, and Tsallis entropies quantifies the spatio-temporal complexity of solutions, while phase space representations reveal the underlying coherence structure. The implementation prioritizes code transparency and educational accessibility over computational performance, providing a valuable pedagogical tool for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. Complete source code, documentation, and example configurations are freely available, enabling reproducible computational experiments across diverse physical contexts where the NLSE governs wave evolution, including nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and ocean surface waves.</description>

      <title>Predicting Brain Morphogenesis via Physics-Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain morphology is shaped by genetic and mechanical factors and is linked to biological development and diseases. Its fractal-like features, regional anisotropy, and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative insights in medical inspections. Recognizing that the underlying elastic instability and bifurcation share the same physics as simple geometries such as spheres and ellipses, we developed a physics-transfer learning framework to address the geometrical complexity. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we constructed a digital library of high-fidelity continuum mechanics modeling that both describes and predicts the developmental processes of brain growth and disease. The physics of nonlinear elasticity from simple geometries is embedded into a neural network and applied to brain models. This physics-transfer approach demonstrates remarkable performance in feature characterization and morphogenesis prediction, highlighting the pivotal role of localized deformation in dominating over the background geometry. The data-driven framework also provides a library of reduced-dimensional evolutionary representations that capture the essential physics of the highly folded cerebral cortex. Validation through medical images and domain expertise underscores the deployment of digital-twin technology in comprehending the morphological complexity of the brain.</description>

      <title>The vortex comb: eliminating vortices from Bose-Einstein condensates using optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce and explore a technique for the efficient removal of vortices from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, through the application and subsequent removal of a one-dimensional optical lattice. We showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow, optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of condensates.</description>

      <title>Modulation instability and frequency-comb generation in hybrid quadratic-cubic resonators with spectral filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation into the phenomenon of filter-induced modulation instability in passive hybrid optical resonators exhibiting quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. We show that asymmetric spectral losses, with respect to the continuous-wave solution frequency, can trigger sideband amplification in the normal dispersion regime. We calculate the parametric gain and demonstrate the associated pattern formation process. We furthermore show how this parametric process can be exploited to generate optical frequency combs with tunable repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>
