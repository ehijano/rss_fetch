      <title>Fair Clustering for Data Summarization: Improved Approximation Algorithms and Complexity Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data summarization tasks are often modeled as $k$-clustering problems, where the goal is to choose $k$ data points, called cluster centers, that best represent the dataset by minimizing a clustering objective. A popular objective is to minimize the maximum distance between any data point and its nearest center, which is formalized as the $k$-center problem. While in some applications all data points can be chosen as centers, in the general setting, centers must be chosen from a predefined subset of points, referred as facilities or suppliers; this is known as the $k$-supplier problem. In this work, we focus on fair data summarization modeled as the fair $k$-supplier problem, where data consists of several groups, and a minimum number of centers must be selected from each group while minimizing the $k$-supplier objective. The groups can be disjoint or overlapping, leading to two distinct problem variants each with different computational complexity.
  We present $3$-approximation algorithms for both variants, improving the previously known factor of $5$. For disjoint groups, our algorithm runs in polynomial time, while for overlapping groups, we present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, where the exponential runtime depends only on the number of groups and centers. We show that these approximation factors match the theoretical lower bounds, assuming standard complexity theory conjectures. Finally, using an open-source implementation, we demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms on large synthetic datasets and assess the price of fairness on real-world data, comparing solution quality with and without fairness constraints.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the graph isomorphism problem to equality checking of $n$-variables polynomials and the algorithms that use the reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.03139v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph isomorphism problem is considered. We assign modified $n$-variable characteristic polynomials for graphs and reduce the graph isomorphism problem to the problem of the polynomials isomorphism. It is required to find out, is there such a numbering of the second graph's vertices that the polynomials of the graphs are equal.
  We present algorithms for the graph isomorphism problem that use the reduction. We prove the propositions that justify the possibility of numerical realization of the algorithms for the general case of the graph isomorphism problem. The algorithms perform equality checking of graphs polynomials. We show that probability of obtaining a wrong solution of the graph isomorphism problem by comparing values of graph polynomials is negligible if the mantissa length is sufficiently large.
  Since, for a graph on $n$ vertices, the graph polynomial has $2^n$ coefficients, its value at some point cannot be evaluated directly for large enough $n$. We show that we can check the equality of the polynomials at some points without direct evaluation of the polynomials values at these points. We prove that it is required $O(n^4)$ elementary machine operations and machine numbers with mantissas length $O(n^2)$ to check equality of the values for the graphs on $n$ vertices.
  For the worst, it needs an exponential from $n$ time to solve the graph isomorphism problem instance using the presented approach, but in practice, it is efficient even for well known computationally hard instances of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Dataless Quadratic Neural Networks for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions for the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To solve our non-convex objective, we propose solving parallel multiple initializations using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. Therefore, we dub our method as parallelized Clique-Informed Quadratic Optimization for MIS (pCQO-MIS). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges.</description>

      <title>Expectation and Variance of the Degree of a Node in Random Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Gibbs distribution over all spanning trees of an undirected, edge weighted finite graph, where, up to normalization, the probability of each tree is given by the product of its edge weights. Defining the weighted degree of a node as the sum of the weights of its incident edges, we present analytical expressions for the expectation, variance and covariance of the weighted degree of a node across the Gibbs distribution. To generalize our approach, we distinguish between two types of weight: probability weights, which regulate the distribution of spanning trees, and degree weights, which define the weighted degree of nodes. This distinction allows us to define the weighted degree of nodes independently of the probability weights. By leveraging the Matrix Tree Theorem, we show that these degree moments ultimately depend on the inverse of a submatrix of the graph Laplacian. While our focus is on undirected graphs, we demonstrate that our results can be extended to the directed setting by considering incoming directed trees instead.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Algorithms for Fractional Linear Matroid Parity via Non-commutative Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix representations are a powerful tool for designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems such as matching, and linear matroid intersection and parity. In this paper, we initiate the study of matrix representations using the concept of non-commutative rank (nc-rank), which has recently attracted attention in the research of Edmonds' problem. We reveal that the nc-rank of the matrix representation of linear matroid parity corresponds to the optimal value of fractional linear matroid parity: a half-integral relaxation of linear matroid parity. Based on our representation, we present an algebraic algorithm for the fractional linear matroid parity problem by building a new technique to incorporate the search-to-decision reduction into the half-integral problem represented via the nc-rank. We further present a faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding a maximum fractional matroid matching and an algebraic algorithm for finding a dual optimal solution. They together lead to an algebraic algorithm for the weighted fractional linear matroid parity problem. Our algorithms are significantly simpler and faster than the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Coboundary and cosystolic expansion without dependence on dimension or degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new bounds on the cosystolic expansion constants of several families of high dimensional expanders, and the known coboundary expansion constants of order complexes of homogeneous geometric lattices, including the spherical building of $SL_n(F_q)$. The improvement applies to the high dimensional expanders constructed by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, and by Kaufman and Oppenheim.
  Our new expansion constants do not depend on the degree of the complex nor on its dimension, nor on the group of coefficients. This implies improved bounds on Gromov's topological overlap constant, and on Dinur and Meshulam's cover stability, which may have applications for agreement testing. In comparison, existing bounds decay exponentially with the ambient dimension (for spherical buildings) and in addition decay linearly with the degree (for all known bounded-degree high dimensional expanders). Our results are based on several new techniques:
  * We develop a new "color-restriction" technique which enables proving dimension-free expansion by restricting a multi-partite complex to small random subsets of its color classes.
  * We give a new "spectral" proof for Evra and Kaufman's local-to-global theorem, deriving better bounds and getting rid of the dependence on the degree. This theorem bounds the cosystolic expansion of a complex using coboundary expansion and spectral expansion of the links.
  * We derive absolute bounds on the coboundary expansion of the spherical building (and any order complex of a homogeneous geometric lattice) by constructing a novel family of very short cones.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>
