      <title>An Advection-Difusion Model Incorporating Investor Inertia for the Dynamics of Financial Asset Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard models of asset price dynamics, such as geometric Brownian motion (Osborne, 1959, Samuelson, 2016), do not formally incorporate investor inertia. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling stock price dynamics that incorporates the concept of investor inertia, inspired by diffusion with retention models (Bevilacqua, 2011). The asset's log-price is modelled as a three-state discrete random walk, allowing for movements in any of three directions: up, down, or neutral. We demonstrate that this framework naturally leads to an advection-diffusion partial differential equation, in which the advection (drift) term arises directly from the asymmetry between buying, selling, and holding decisions. Remarkably, the model implies that log-prices follow a normal distribution a finding of great practical interest due to its analytical tractability. The applicability of the model is confirmed through simulation and an empirical application using Brazilian PETR4.SA data.</description>

      <title>Existence and Calculation of Optimal Equilibria on Overlapping Generations Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known feature of overlapping generations economies is that the First Welfare Theorem fails and equilibrium may be inefficient. The Cass (1972) criterion furnishes a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency, but does not address the matter of existence of efficient equilibria, and Cass, Okuno, and Zilcha (1979) provide nonexistence examples. I develop an algorithm based on successive approximations of a nonstationary, consumption-loan, prone to savings, overlapping generations economy with finite-lived heterogeneous agents to find elements of its set of equilibria as the limit of nested compact sets. These compact sets are the result of a backward calculation through equilibrium equations that departs from the set of Pareto optimal equilibria of well-behaved tail economies. The equilibria calculated through this algorithm satisfy the Cass (1972) criterion and are used to derive the existence results on efficient equilibria.</description>

      <title>Group Formation through Game Theory and Agent-Based Modeling: Spatial Cohesion, Heterogeneity, and Resource Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic model and an agent-based model to study group formation driven by resource pooling, spatial cohesion, and heterogeneity. We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public, private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources. Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups. These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition, guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Watts and Drops: Co-Scheduling Power and Water in Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to jointly schedule water and electricity in a profit-maximizing renewable colocated water desalination plant that integrates both thermal and membrane based technologies. The price-taking desalination plant sells desalinated water to a water utility at a given price and engages in bidirectional electricity transactions with the grid, purchasing or selling power based on its net electricity demand. We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.</description>

      <title>Prudence and higher-order risk attitudes in the rank-dependent utility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a full characterization of consistency with respect to higher-order stochastic dominance within the rank-dependent utility model. Different from the results in the literature, we do not assume any condition on the utility functions and the probability weighting functions, such as differentiability or continuity. It turns out that the level of generality that we offer leads to models that do not have a continuous probability weighting function and yet they satisfy prudence. In particular, the corresponding probability weighting function can only have a jump at 1, and must be linear on [0,1).</description>
