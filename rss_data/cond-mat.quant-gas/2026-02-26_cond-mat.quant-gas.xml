      <title>Finite-temperature superfluid depletion of disordered Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At zero temperature, homogeneous interacting Bose-condensed fluids are entirely superfluid, with remarkable transport properties. A non-superfluid, normal component is induced by finite temperatures and spatial inhomogeneity, the combined effects of which are rather intriguing, and difficult to describe quantitatively. By inhomogeneous Bogoliubov theory, applicable to weakly interacting condensed Bose gases in static external potentials with arbitrary spatial correlations, we calculate the normal fluid density via the transverse current-current correlation. We obtain finite-temperature disorder corrections to the normal fraction known since Laudau's seminal two-fluid theory, using diagrammatic perturbation theory for systems of any dimensionality, with closed analytical expressions to leading, quadratic order in disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Universal Transport Properties of Continuous quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drude weight characterizes ballistic transport in quantum many-body systems, yet a comprehensive understanding and exact analytical results for it remain elusive, especially in multi-component quantum gases. In this work, we leverage Generalized Hydrodynamics and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method to precisely compute the Drude weights of one-dimensional continuous integrable systems, such as the Lieb-Liniger model and the Bose-Fermi mixture model. We establish an exact, universal relationship between components of the Drude weight matrix and fundamental thermodynamic quantities (e.g., particle, enthalpy, and entropy densities) for the constituent particles with distinct statistics undergo dynamic coupling. For both models, we further derive analytical approximations of the Drude weight in distinct physical regimes and identify universal scaling laws for the Drude weight near quantum phase transitions.Finally, to connect theory with experiment, we propose and simulate two feasible measurement protocols--a linear potential quench and a bipartitioning setup-verifying that they can reliably extract the Drude weights. Our results establish a direct link between macroscopic transport phenomena and microscopic quasiparticle structure, furnishing critical theoretical benchmarks for future ultracold atomic gas experiments.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved transport of ultracold atoms across the Anderson transition: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent experiment [X. Yu et al., arXiv:2602.07654], energy-resolved measurements of an atomic matter wave spreading in a speckle potential enabled the direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition. In this work, we present a quantitative theoretical description of the matter-wave dynamics based on a tailored implementation of the self-consistent theory of localization, which incorporates both the spectral and spatial properties of the state prepared in the disorder. We benchmark this theoretical approach against ab initio numerical simulations, and use it to analyze the atom density profiles observed experimentally in the localized, diffusive, and critical regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on the key role of the atomic energy distribution, especially on the distinct contributions of Bose-condensed and thermal atoms to interpret the experimental profiles. Our framework provides a versatile and efficient theoretical toolbox for quantitatively describing wave-packet dynamics in three-dimensional disordered quantum systems, which remain challenging for state-of-the-art large-scale numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Efimov Effect in Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical description is presented for the three-body physics of shielded dipolar molecules, including a prediction of observable Efimov physics. Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers. Moreover, the three-body parameter expressed in dipolar units is found to be universal.</description>

      <title>Integral formula for the propagator of the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact integral formula for the multi-particle propagator of the one-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model on an infinite lattice. The proof is based on the nested Bethe ansatz without relying on the string hypothesis. Our formula enables an explicit integral representation of the time evolution of arbitrary finite-particle wave functions and thereby provides a foundation for the exact analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics in the Hubbard model. It can further be applied to related open quantum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state of a Fermi gas with short range attrative interactions in one or two dimensions. N fermions are placed in a confining potential, and interact with each other through a negative potential, whose range is larger than the typical distance between particles. We show the convergence of the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian to a Thomas-Fermi energy in the large N limit. Furthermore, we prove convergence of the ground states, in the sense of their Husimi functions.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of damping in a turbulent atomic Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence enhances momentum transport in classical fluids, effectively increasing their viscosity. We investigate an analogous effect in a superfluid by measuring the damping of collective oscillations in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing stationary spin-superflow turbulence. Using continuous spin driving to maintain turbulence in a spin-1 $^{23}$Na BEC, we excite its quadrupole mode and measure the damping rate over a range of temperatures. The damping consistently exceeds the Landau-damping rate expected for an equilibrium, non-turbulent BEC. The enhancement likely originates from two complementary processes: direct energy transfer from the mode to turbulent condensate fluctuations and turbulence-induced modification of the thermal cloud that amplifies Landau damping. These results establish collective-mode damping as a sensitive probe of momentum transport in superfluid turbulence.</description>

      <title>Suppression and enhancement of bosonic stimulation by atomic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a hallmark of quantum statistics. This bunching can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering when atoms scatter into already occupied states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering follows directly from the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, strongly affect atom-light scattering. Changes in local atomic correlations suppress the bosonic enhancement under weak repulsive interactions and increase the scattering rate under attractive ones. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the collisional dynamics of the momentum-space populations. Its extreme sensitivity to correlation effects makes off-resonant light scattering a powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Energy Injection in the Gross-Pitaevskii Framework for Turbulence in Neutron Star Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of both a single large spin and a pair of spins in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields, which can be important for qudit-based quantum technologies. Notably, we find resonant, periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Additionally, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. The dynamics also exhibit a periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state, starting from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. For a pair of spins, we derive various resonance conditions and further analyze the entanglement generated by dipole-dipole interactions. In the case of two spin-1/2 particles, the entanglement dynamics reveal resonances and kinks in the maximum entanglement, and their criteria can be obtained from the energy spectrum. Strikingly, we show that the kink can be exploited to engineer the entanglement dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the regime of weak dipolar interactions, which are relevant for dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
