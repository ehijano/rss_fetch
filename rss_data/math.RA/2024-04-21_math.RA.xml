      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the commuting automorphisms of nilpotent Lie algebras $L$ with coclass $\leq 3$. Our examination exposes the conditions under which the set of commuting automorphisms of $L$ forms a subgroup within its automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Expanding \v{C}ech cohomology for quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand \v{C}ech cohomology of a topological space $X$ with values in a presheaf on $X$ to \v{C}ech cohomology of a commutative ring with unity $R$ with values in a presheaf on $R$. The strategy is to observe that both the set of open subsets of $X$ and the set of ideals of $R$ provide examples of a (semicartesian) quantale. We study a particular pair of (adjoint) functors $(\theta, \tau)$ between the quantale of open subsets of $X$ and the quantale of ideals of $C(X)$, the ring of real-valued continuous functions on $X$. This leads to the main result of this paper: the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of $X$ with values on the constant sheaf $F$ on $X$ is isomorphic to the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of the ring $C(X)$ with values on a sheaf $F \circ \tau$ on $C(X)$.</description>

      <title>When Leibniz Bialgebras are Nijenhuis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a "non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <title>On finite dimensional algebras with trivial derivation (automorphism)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with $n$ dimensional algebras, over any field, which have only trivial derivation (automorphism). It is shown that the corresponding sets of algebras are not empty and in algebraically closed field case they are dense subsets of the variety of $n$ dimensional algebras with respect to the Zariski topology. An application to the problems of local, $k$-local derivations(automorphisms) of finite dimensional algebras is provided as well.</description>

      <title>Chromatic quasisymmetric functions and noncommutative $P$-symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a natural unit interval order $P$, we describe proper colorings of the incomparability graph of $P$ in the language of heaps. We also introduce a combinatorial operation, called a \emph{local flip}, on the heaps. This operation defines an equivalence relation on the proper colorings, and the equivalence relation refines the ascent statistic introduced by Shareshian and Wachs.
  In addition, we define an analogue of noncommutative symmetric functions introduced by Fomin and Greene, with respect to $P$. We establish a duality between the chromatic quasisymmetric function of $P$ and these noncommutative symmetric functions. This duality leads us to positive expansions of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions into several symmetric function bases. In particular, we present some partial results for the $e$-positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Finite $\mathbb{Z}$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$, i.e., for a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra which is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module, we assume that $R$ is explicitly given by a system of $\mathbb{Z}$-module generators $G$, its relation module ${\rm Syz}(G)$, and the structure constants of the multiplication in $R$. In this setting we develop and analyze efficient algorithms for computing essential information about $R$. First we provide polynomial time algorithms for solving linear systems of equations over $R$ and for basic ideal-theoretic operations in $R$. Then we develop ZPP (zero-error probabilitic polynomial time) algorithms to compute the nilradical and the maximal ideals of 0-dimensional affine algebras $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$ with $K=\mathbb{Q}$ or $K=\mathbb{F}_p$. The task of finding the associated primes of a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$ is reduced to these cases and solved in ZPPIF (ZPP plus one integer factorization). With the same complexity, we calculate the connected components of the set of minimal associated primes ${\rm minAss}(R)$ and then the primitive idempotents of $R$. Finally, we prove that knowing an explicit representation of $R$ is polynomial time equivalent to knowing a strong Gr\"obner basis of an ideal $I$ such that $R = \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$.</description>

      <title>Modular Representations of Truncated current Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the structure and representation theory of truncated current algebras $\mathfrak{g}_m = \mathfrak{g}[t]/(t^{m+1})$ associated to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of a standard reductive group over a field of positive characteristic. We classify semisimple and nilpotent elements and describe their associated support varieties. Next, we prove various Morita equivalences for reduced enveloping algebras, including a reduction to nilpotent $p$-characters, analogous to a famous theorem of Friedlander--Parshall.
  We go on to give precise upper bounds for the dimensions of simple modules for all $p$-characters, and give lower bounds on these dimensions for homogeneous $p$-characters. We then develop the theory of baby Verma modules for homogeneous $p$-characters and, whenever the $p$-character has standard Levi type, we give a full classification of the simple modules. In particular we classify all simple modules with homogeneous $p$-characters for $\mathfrak{g}_m$ when $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{gl}_n$. Finally, we compute the Cartan invariants for the restricted enveloping algebra $U_0(\mathfrak{g}_m)$ and show that they can be described by precise formulae depending on decomposition numbers for $U_0(\mathfrak{g})$.</description>

      <title>The lowest discriminant ideal of central extensions of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous joint paper with Wu and Yakimov, we gave an explicit description of the lowest discriminant ideal in a Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra (H,C,tr) of degree d over an algebraically closed field k, char k $\notin[1, d]$ with basic identity fiber, i.e. all irreducible representations over the kernel of the counit of the central Hopf subalgebra C are one-dimensional. Using results developed in that paper, we compute relevant quantities associated with irreducible representations to explicitly describe the zero set of the lowest discriminant ideal in the group algebra of a central extension of the product of two arbitrary finitely generated Abelian groups by any finite Abelian group under some conditions. Over a fixed maximal ideal of C the representations are tensor products of representations each corresponding to a central extension of a subgroup isomorphic to the product of two cyclic groups of the same order. A description of the orbit of the identity, i.e. the kernel of the counit of C, under winding automorphisms is also given.</description>
