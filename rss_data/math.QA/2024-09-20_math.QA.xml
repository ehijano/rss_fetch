      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, II. The tetrahedral flow is a coboundary in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kontsevich constructed a map from suitable cocycles in the graph complex to infinitesimal deformations of Poisson bi-vector fields. Under the deformations, the bi-vector fields remain Poisson. We ask, are these deformations trivial, meaning, do they amount to a change of coordinates along a vector field? We examine this question for the tetrahedron, the smallest nontrivial suitable graph cocycle in the Kontsevich graph complex, and for the class of Nambu--Poisson brackets on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Within Kontsevich's graph calculus, we use dimension-specific micro-graphs, in which each vertex represents an ingredient of the Nambu--Poisson bracket. For the tetrahedron, Kontsevich knew that the deformation is trivial for $d = 2$ (1996). In 2020, Buring and the third author found that the deformation is trivial for $d = 3$. Building on these discoveries, we now establish that the deformation is trivial for $d = 4$.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert Space of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model, Deformed Double Current Algebra Action, and the Conformal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons matrix model was proposed by Dorey, Tong, and Turner to describe non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a geometric quantization point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a framed Jordan quiver. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using localization technique. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert variety, we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.
  We define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model. We show that the conformal limit of the Hilbert space is an irreducible integrable module of $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ with level identified with the matrix model level. Moreover, we prove that $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ generators can be obtained from scaling limits of matrix model operators, which settles a conjecture of Dorey-Tong-Turner. The key to the proof is the construction of a Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the conformal limit of the Hilbert space, which we expect to be equivalent to the $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the integrable $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ modules constructed by Uglov. We also characterize eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix model Hilbert space with respect to a maximal commutative subalgebra of Yangian.</description>

      <title>Frobenius algebra objects in Temperley-Lieb categories at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.
  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</description>

      <title>Abelian TQFTS and Schr\"odinger local systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an action of 3-cobordisms on the finite dimensional Schr\"odinger representations of the Heisenberg group by Lagrangian correspondences. In addition, we review the construction of the abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) associated with a $q$-deformation of $U(1)$ for any root of unity $q$. We prove that for3-cobor\-disms compatible with Lagrangian correspondences, there is a normalization of the associated Schr\"odinger bimodule action that reproduces the abelian TQFT. The full abelian TQFT provides a projective representation of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)$ on the Schr\"odinger representation,which is linearizable at odd root of 1. Motivated by homology of surface configurations with Schr\"odinger representation as local coefficients, we define another projective action of $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)$ on Schr\"odinger representations. We show that the latter is not linearizable by identifying the associated 2-cocycle.</description>

      <title>Quantum Games and Synchronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and that its perfect quantum-commuting (bi)strategies are quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.</description>
