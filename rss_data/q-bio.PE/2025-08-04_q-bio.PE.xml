      <title>Effect of protection zone on the dynamics of a diffusion-advection population-toxicant model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes a diffusion-advection model coupling population dynamics with toxicant transport, incorporating a boundary protection zone. For both upstream and downstream protection zone configurations, we investigate the combined influence of protected zones and key ecological factors on population persistence or extinction. Employing monotone dynamical system theory and eigenvalue analysis, we establish the global dynamics of the population-toxicant coexistence equilibrium. Furthermore, we characterize the parameter dependence governing the stability of the toxicant-only steady state, specifically examining the protected zone length, toxicant effect coefficient on population growth, per-unit contaminant discharge rate, toxicant input rate, diffusion/advection rates, and population natural growth rate. Finally, numerical simulations reveal the complex interplay between the protection zone and toxicant advection rate in significantly shaping population persistence domains.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Fish School Fragmentation under Predation Using Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study builds upon our previously proposed stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based model to further investigate fish school fragmentation under predation. Specifically, we explore structural dynamics by incorporating graph-theoretic metrics--namely, the number of connected components--to quantify changes in prey school organization. Two quantitative indicators, first split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing and extent of group disintegration. Sensitivity analyses are performed on key parameters to evaluate their influence on group stability under nearest attack and center attack strategies. We independently examine the effect of environmental noise on fish school cohesion. Simulation results show that parameter changes impact fish school fragmentation differently under the two predation strategies. High environmental noise also makes it difficult for the school to stay cohesive. This framework provides a structured and quantitative basis for assessing how fish schools respond to different predation strategies and environmental noise levels.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of pan-immunity maintenance by horizontal gene transfer in the ecological dynamics of bacteria and phages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria and phages have been in an ongoing arms race for billions of years. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counter-defense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counter-defense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed "pan-immune" system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka-Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counter-defense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counter-defense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a "dying" strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the "island migration" model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.</description>

      <title>When are quarnets sufficient to reconstruct semi-directed phylogenetic networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are graphs that are used to represent evolutionary relationships between different taxa. They generalize phylogenetic trees since for example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has been rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed edges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One reason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network using real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed phylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it induces on the 4-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are called quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-2 phylogenetic networks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for level-3. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed binary network, a tree that give the coarse-grained structure of the network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network. These results are relevant for proving the statistical consistency of programs that are currently being developed for reconstructing phylogenetic networks from practical data, such as the recently developed Squirrel software tool.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>
