      <title>Carbon Trapping Efficiency of Hydropower Reservoirs under the Influence of a Tropical Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sedimentation in hydroelectric reservoirs is strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities within their upstream drainage basins. These activities, encompassing soil erosion and various other human-induced actions, have significant consequences for sedimentation patterns. This issue has been a subject of prolonged study, as sedimentation directly undermines the water storage capacity of reservoirs, consequently diminishing the overall efficiency of hydroelectric operations. Several scientists have dedicated their efforts to addressing the matter of reservoir sedimentation. This pursuit has led to the formulation of an indicator known as Sediment Trap Efficiency (STE), serving as a metric that quantifies the proportion of sedimentation within reservoirs relative to the influx of sediment from their upstream sources. This study seeks to present findings pertaining to carbon trapping efficiency observed across seven hydroelectric reservoirs in Brazil. The objective is to demonstrate the substantial relevance of carbon accumulation within these aquatic environments within the context of the carbon balance frameworks previously established.</description>

      <title>Daily Groundwater Monitoring Using Vehicle-DAS Elastic Full-waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding groundwater dynamics is critical for sustainable water management, particularly as climate extremes intensify. However, the resolutions of existing subsurface observational tools are still inadequate for detailed aquifer monitoring and imaging. We introduce an innovative technique for groundwater monitoring using time-lapse full-waveform inversion, leveraging fiber-optic cables as seismic sensors and vehicular traffic as repetitive seismic sources. Over a two-year period along Sandhill Road, California, this approach captures detailed spatiotemporal S-wave velocity variations, revealing a 2.9% reduction corresponding to a 9.0-meter groundwater table rise after atmospheric-river storms in Water Year 2023. Notably, this approach enables the high-resolution daily analysis of rapid aquifer responses. We observe spatially inhomogeneous velocity changes, with less reduction beneath impervious paved zones than under grassy areas, underscoring the impact of urbanization on the natural recharge of aquifers. Our findings highlight the potential of Vehicle-DAS FWI for high-resolution daily monitoring and quantitative spatiotemporal characterizations of groundwater systems.</description>

      <title>Coevolving aerodynamic and impact ripples on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Windblown sand creates multiscale bedforms on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples emerge via distinct mechanisms on Earth: a hydrodynamic instability related to a phase shift between the turbulent flow and the topography, and a granular instability related to a synchronization of hopping grains with the topography. Here, we report the reproducible creation of coevolving centimeter and decimeter-scale ripples on fine-grained monodisperse sand beds in ambient-air and low-pressure wind-tunnels, revealing two adjacent mesoscale growth instabilities. Their morphological traits and our quantitative grain-scale numerical simulations authenticate the smaller structures as impact ripples but point at a hydrodynamic origin for the larger ones. This suggests that the aeolian transport layer would have to partially respond to the topography on a scale comparable to the average hop length, hence faster than previously thought, but consistent with the phase lag of the inferred aeolian sand flux relative to the wind. Hydrodynamic modelling supports the existence of hydrodynamic aerodynamic ripples on Earth, connecting them mechanistically to megaripples and to the debated Martian ripples. We thereby propose a unified framework for mesoscale granular bedforms found across the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Emission Sensor Network Optimization Based on Grid Loop Search and Particle Swarm Source Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layout of acoustic emission sensors plays a critical role in non-destructive structural testing. This study proposes a grid-based optimization method focused on multi-source location results, in contrast to traditional sensor layout optimization methods that construct a correlation matrix based on sensor layout and one source location. Based on the seismic source travel-time theory, the proposed method establishes a location objective function based on minimum travel-time differences, which is solved through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, based on location accuracy across various configurations, the method systematically evaluates potential optimal sensor locations through grid search. Synthetic tests and laboratory pencil-lead break (PLB) experiments are conducted to compare the effectiveness of PSO, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing, with the following conclusions: (1) In synthetic tests, the proposed method achieved an average location error of 1.78 mm, outperforming that based on the traditional layout, genetic algorithm (GA), and simulated annealing (SA). (2) For different noise cases, the location accuracy separately improved by 24.89% ({\sigma}=0.5{\mu}s), 12.59% ({\sigma}=2{\mu}s), and 15.06% ({\sigma}=5{\mu}s) compared with the traditional layout. (3) For the PLB experiments, the optimized layout achieved an average location error of 9.37 mm, which improved the location accuracy by 59.15% compared with the Traditional layout.</description>

      <title>Clustering indications before the Mw7.0 2020 Samos, Greece, main shock as revealed in an equivalent dimensions space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation to equivalent dimensions that offers a novel approach for investigating earthquake clustering was engaged to analyze the preparatory phase of the 2020 Samos, Greece, Mw7.0 main shock. The analysis considered earthquakes that occurred between 2006 and October 2020, covering an area extended three times the length of the main rupture. Each earthquake was parameterized by its magnitude, the interevent time (interval since the previous earthquake), and the interevent spatial distance (distance between the epicenters of consecutive earthquakes). Transforming these parameters into equivalent dimensions allowed them to be directly compared. The degree of clustering was quantified using the average distance between earthquakes in this transformed parameter space, calculated within consecutive 100 events data windows. Results revealed a distinct pattern, the average distance was increasing steadily during the twelve year period before the main shock. These temporal changes in the average distance were driven by a systematic evolution of earthquake clustering in the used parameter space. Beginning from a two-cluster system, when the distance was minimal, the clustering development continued along two branches and ended before the main shock with the formation of five earthquake clusters of different characteristics.</description>

      <title>Unified Flow Rule of Undeveloped and Fully Developed Dense Granular Flows Down Rough Inclines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on chute measurements of the free-surface velocity $v$ in dense flows of spheres and diverse sands and spheres-sand mixtures down rough inclines. These and previous measurements are inconsistent with standard flow rules, in which the Froude number $v/\sqrt{gh}$ scales linearly with $h/h_s$ or $(\tan\theta/\mu_r)^2h/h_s$, where $\mu_r$ is the dynamic friction coefficient, $h$ the flow thickness, and $h_s(\theta)$ its smallest value that permits a steady, uniform dense flow state at a given inclination angle $\theta$. This is because the characteristic length $L$ a flow needs to fully develop can exceed the chute or travel length $l$ and because neither rule is universal for fully developed flows across granular materials. We use a dimensional analysis motivated by a recent unification of sediment transport to derive a flow rule that solves both problems in accordance with our and previous measurements: $v=v_\infty[1-\exp(-l/L)]^{1/2}$, with $v_\infty\propto\mu_r^{3/2}\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{4/3}$ and $L\propto\mu_r^3\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{5/3}h$.</description>

      <title>Experimental models for cohesive granular materials: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials are involved in most industrial and environmental processes, as well as many civil engineering applications. Although significant advances have been made in understanding the statics and dynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granular systems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains. The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially larger than the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify their overall behavior. While considerable progress has been made in understanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealized numerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating and expanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. In recent years, various experimental approaches have been developed to control inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further our understanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews different approaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relative stickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics. Some recent experimental studies relying on model cohesive grains are synthesized, and opportunities and perspectives in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Absorbing boundary conditions in material point method adopting perfectly matched layer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on solving the numerical challenges of imposing absorbing boundary conditions for dynamic simulations in the material point method (MPM). To attenuate elastic waves leaving the computational domain, the current work integrates the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) theory into the implicit MPM framework. The proposed approach introduces absorbing particles surrounding the computational domain that efficiently absorb outgoing waves and reduce reflections, allowing for accurate modeling of wave propagation and its further impact on geotechnical slope stability analysis. The study also includes several benchmark tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, such as several types of impulse loading and symmetric and asymmetric base shaking. The conducted numerical tests also demonstrate the ability to handle large deformation problems, including the failure of elasto-plastic soils under gravity and dynamic excitations. The findings extend the capability of MPM in simulating continuous analysis of earthquake-induced landslides, from shaking to failure.</description>

      <title>Embracing Uncertainty in "Small Data" Problems: Estimating Earthquakes from Historical Anecdotes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seismic risk estimates will be vastly improved with an increased understanding of historical (and pre-historical) seismic events. However the only existing data for these events is anecdotal and sparse. To address this we developed a framework based on Bayesian inference to estimate the location and magnitude of pre-instrumental earthquakes. We present a careful analysis of results obtained from this procedure which justifies the sampling algorithm, its convergence to the resultant posterior distribution, and yields estimates on uncertainties in the relevant quantities. Using a priori estimates on the posterior and numerical approximations of the Hessian, we demonstrate that the 1852 Banda Sea earthquake and tsunami is indeed well-understood given certain explicit hypotheses. Using the same techniques we also find that the 1820 south Sulawesi event may best be explained by a dual fault rupture, best attributed to the Kalatoa fault potentially conjoining the Flores thrust and Walanae/Selayar fault.</description>
