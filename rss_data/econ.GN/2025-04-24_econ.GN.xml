      <title>The Effects of Trade Openness on CO2 Emission in Vietnam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between trade openness and CO2 emissions in Vietnam using the data from 1986 to 2014. We examine the consistency of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis (EKC) and the pollution heaven hypothesis (PHH) in Vietnam case. In 1986 Vietnam government began to launch free-market economic reforms. Since then, Vietnam economy experienced the breakthrough innovation in trade openness. On the other hand, Vietnam witness a growing level of CO2 emission. The annual growth rate of CO2 emission during the period is 7.26%, and that of trade volume is 16.11%. The empirical results show that the relationship between CO2 emissions and income per capita is an inverted U-shaped, consistent with to EKC hypothesis. We also find that the pollution heaven hypothesis is supported in that energy use and international trade contribute to air pollution, but becoming a full member of WTO brings positive effect to Vietnamese environment.</description>

      <title>Skills Beget Skills: Evidence from Historical School Reforms Targeting Health and Further Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic complementarity between school health and education reforms implemented in Denmark between 1940 and 1965: the introduction of school doctors and the expansion of secondary education. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach for multiple treatments, we study the reform effects on individuals' outcomes in the ages 55-64. We find that each reform leads to significant improvements in health and education outcomes, including reduced mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and higher educational attainment. The singular impact of each reform is doubled when both reforms are implemented together, resulting in a 9 percent increase in earnings. These findings underscore high societal returns to complementary school investments in the long term.</description>

      <title>Cybernetic Governance in a Coliving House</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an 18-month field experiment in distributed digital institutions: a nine-bedroom Los Angeles coliving house that runs without managers, while sustaining 98% occupancy and below-market rents.
  Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's commons theory, we outline design principles and three digital mechanisms that form the institutional core: 1) A continuous-auction chore scheduler turns regenerative labor into a time-indexed points market; residents meet a 100-point monthly obligation by claiming tasks whose value rises linearly with neglect. 2) A pairwise-preference layer lets participants asynchronously reprioritize tasks, translating meta-governance into low-cognition spot inputs. 3) A symbolic "hearts" ledger tracks norm compliance through automated enforcement, lightweight challenges, and peer-awarded karma. Together, these mechanisms operationalize cybernetic principles--human sensing, machine bookkeeping, real-time feedback--while minimizing dependence on privileged roles.
  Our exploratory data (567 chore claims, 255 heart events, and 551 group purchases) show that such tooling can sustain reliable commons governance without continuous leadership, offering a transferable design palette for online communities, coliving houses, and other digitally mediated collectives.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Shock Recovery in IO Networks with Priority Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical risks, such as droughts, floods, rising temperatures, earthquakes, infrastructure failures, and geopolitical conflicts, can ripple through global supply chains, raising costs, and constraining production across industries. Assessing these risks requires understanding not only their immediate effects, but also their cascading impacts. For example, a localized drought can disrupt the supply of critical raw materials such as cobalt or copper, affecting battery and electric vehicle production. Similarly, regional conflicts can impede cross-border trade, leading to broader economic consequences. Building on an existing model of simultaneous supply and demand shocks, we introduce a new propagation algorithm, Priority with Constraint, which modifies standard priority-based rationing by incorporating a minimum supply guarantee for all customers, regardless of their size or priority ranking. We also identify a buffer effect inherent in the Industry Proportional algorithm, which reflects real-world economic resilience. Finally, we extend the static shock propagation model to incorporate dynamic processes. We introduce mechanisms for gradual shock propagation, reflecting demand stickiness and the potential buffering role of inventories, and gradual recovery, modeling the simultaneous recovery of supply capacity and the inherent tendency for demand to return to pre-shock levels. Simulations demonstrate how the interplay between demand adjustment speed and supply recovery speed significantly influences the severity and duration of the economic impact after a shock.</description>

      <title>Cursed Job Market Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how cursedness, the tendency to neglect how other people's strategies depend on their private information, affects information transmission in Spence's job market signaling game. We characterize the Cursed Sequential Equilibrium and show that as players become more cursed, the worker obtains less education -- a costly signal that does not enhance productivity -- suggesting that cursedness improves the efficiency of information transmission. However, this efficiency improvement depends on the richness of the message space. Revisiting the job market signaling experiment by K\"ubler, M\"uller, and Normann (2008), we find supportive evidence for our theory.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Markets for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.00078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model for regulation to achieve AI safety: global regulatory markets. We first sketch the model in general terms and provide an overview of the costs and benefits of this approach. We then demonstrate how the model might work in practice: responding to the risk of adversarial attacks on AI models employed in commercial drones.</description>
