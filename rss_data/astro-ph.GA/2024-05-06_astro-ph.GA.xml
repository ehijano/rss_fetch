      <title>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: The nature of the faint source population and SFR-radio luminosity relation using Prospector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting has been extensively used to determine the nature of the faint radio source population. Recent efforts have combined fits from multiple SED-fitting codes to account for the host galaxy and any active nucleus that may be present. We show that it is possible to produce similar-quality classifications using a single energy-balance SED fitting code, Prospector, to model up to 26 bands of UV$-$far-infrared aperture-matched photometry for $\sim$31,000 sources in the ELAIS-N1 field from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Deep fields first data release. One of a new generation of SED-fitting codes, Prospector accounts for potential contributions from radiative active galactic nuclei (AGN) when estimating galaxy properties, including star formation rates (SFRs) derived using non-parametric star formation histories. Combining this information with radio luminosities, we classify 92 per cent of the radio sources as a star-forming galaxy, high/low-excitation radio galaxy, or radio-quiet AGN and study the population demographics as a function of 150 MHz flux density, luminosity, SFR, stellar mass, redshift and apparent $r$-band magnitude. Finally, we use Prospector SED fits to investigate the SFR$-$150 MHz luminosity relation for a sample of $\sim$$133,000~3.6~\mu$m-selected $z&lt;1$ sources, finding that the stellar mass dependence is significantly weaker than previously reported, and may disappear altogether at $\log_{10} (\mathrm{SFR}/M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) &gt; 0.5$. This approach makes it significantly easier to classify radio sources from LoTSS and elsewhere, and may have important implications for future studies of star-forming galaxies at radio wavelengths.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS I: Searching for Low Surface Brightness X-ray Emission with Chandra/ACIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAUNAS (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), a pipeline designed for detecting diffuse X-ray emission in the data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. SAUNAS queries the available observations in the Chandra archive, performs photometric calibration, PSF (point spread function) modeling, and deconvolution, point-source removal, adaptive smoothing, and background correction. This pipeline builds on existing and well-tested software including CIAO, VorBin, and LIRA. We characterize the performance of SAUNAS through several quality performance tests, and demonstrate the broad applications and capabilities of SAUNAS using two galaxies already known to show X-ray emitting structures. SAUNAS successfully detects the 30 kpc X-ray super-wind of NGC 3079 using Chandra/ACIS datasets, matching the spatial distribution detected with more sensitive XMM-Newton observations. The analysis performed by SAUNAS reveals an extended low surface brightness source in the field of UGC 5101 in the 0.3-1.0 keV and 1.0-2.0 keV bands. This source is potentially a background galaxy cluster or a hot gas plume associated with UGC 5101. SAUNAS demonstrates its ability to recover previously undetected structures in archival data, expanding exploration into the low surface brightness X-ray universe with Chandra/ACIS.</description>

      <title>A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z&gt;10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z&gt;6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z&gt;10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum transfer in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueling star formation in large, disky galaxies, requires a continuous supply of gas accreting into star-forming regions. Previously, we characterized this accretion in 4 Milky Way mass galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) in the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations, focusing on runs with cosmic ray physics. At $z\sim0$, gas within the inner circumgalactic medium (iCGM) approaches the disk with comparable angular momentum (AM) to the disk edge, joining in the outer half of the gaseous disk. Within the disk, gas moves inward at velocities of $\sim$1-5~km~s$^{-1}$ while fully rotationally supported. In this study, we analyze the torques that drive these flows. In all cases, we find that the torques in disks enable gas accreted near the disk edge to transport inwards and fuel star formation in the central few kpc. The primary sources of torque come from gravity, hydrodynamical forces, and the sub-grid $P dV$ work done by supernova (SNe) remnants interacting with gas on $\lesssim$10 pc scales. These SNe remnant interactions provide a major source of torque on the gas, inducing negative torques within the inner disk and positive torques in the outer disk. The gas-gas gravitational, hydro, and "feedback" torques all transfer AM outward to where accreting gas is joining the disk, playing an important role in driving inflows and regulating disk structure. Gravitational torques from stars and dark matter provide an AM sink within the innermost regions of the disk and iCGM, respectively. Torques from viscous shearing, magnetic forces, stellar winds, and radiative transfer are largely insignificant.</description>

      <title>The SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Scientific Motivation and Project Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM). The LVM is an integral-field spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, and of a sample of local volume galaxies, connecting resolved pc-scale individual sources of feedback to kpc-scale ionized interstellar medium (ISM) properties. The 4-year survey covers the southern Milky Way disk at spatial resolutions of 0.05 to 1 pc, the Magellanic Clouds at 10 pc resolution, and nearby large galaxies at larger scales totaling $&gt;4300$ square degrees of sky, and more than 55M spectra. It utilizes a new facility of alt-alt mounted siderostats feeding 16 cm refractive telescopes, lenslet-coupled fiber-optics, and spectrographs covering 3600-9800A at R ~ 4000. The ultra-wide field IFU has a diameter of 0.5 degrees with 1801 hexagonally packed fibers of 35.3 arcsec apertures. The siderostats allow for a completely stationary fiber system, avoiding instability of the line spread function seen in traditional fiber feeds. Scientifically, LVM resolves the regions where energy, momentum, and chemical elements are injected into the ISM at the scale of gas clouds, while simultaneously charting where energy is being dissipated (via cooling, shocks, turbulence, bulk flows, etc.) to global scales. This combined local and global view enables us to constrain physical processes regulating how stellar feedback operates and couples to galactic kinematics and disk-scale structures, such as the bar and spiral arms, as well as gas in- and out-flows.</description>

      <title>Evolution of HOD and galaxy properties in filaments and nodes of the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and galaxy properties of nodes and filamentary structures obtained by DisPerSE from the Illustris TNG300-1 hydrodynamical simulation, in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. We compute the HOD in filaments and nodes and fit the HOD parameters to study their evolution, taking into account both faint and bright galaxies. In nodes, the number of faint galaxies increases with the decreasing redshift in the low-mass halos, while no significant differences are seen in the high-mass halos. Limiting the HOD to bright galaxies shows that the halos increase in mass more than the number of bright galaxies they accrete. For filaments, no large differences in HOD are found for faint galaxies, although for brighter galaxies the behaviour is similar to that for nodes. The HOD parametrization suggests that filaments have no effect on the mass required to host a galaxy (central or satellite), whereas nodes do. The results of the study indicate that filaments do not seem to affect the stellar mass content of galaxies. In contrast, nodes appear to affect halos with masses below approximately $10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ at local redshift. The analysis of the galaxy colour evolution shows a reddening towards lower redshift, although these processes seem to be more efficient in massive halos, with a strong effect on the bright galaxies. The general evolution suggests that the building of galaxy population within halos is influenced by both the accretion of faint galaxies and the mass growth of the bright ones.</description>

      <title>High-mass star formation across the Large Magellanic Cloud I. Chemical properties and hot molecular cores observed with ALMA at 1.2 mm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the impact of the initial effects of metallicity (i.e., the abundance of elements heavier than helium) on star formation and the formation of different molecular species, we searched for hot molecular cores in the sub-solar metallicity environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We conducted an ALMA Band 6 observations of 20 fields centered on young stellar objects (YSOs) distributed over the LMC in order to search for hot molecular cores in this galaxy. We detected a total of 65 compact 1.2 mm continuum cores in the 20 ALMA fields and analyzed their spectra with XCLASS software. The main temperature tracers are CH3OH and SO2, with more than two transitions detected in the observed frequency ranges. Other molecular lines with high detection rates in our sample are CS , SO, H13CO+, H13CN, HC15 N, and SiO. More complex molecules, such as HNCO, HDCO, HC3N, CH3CN, and NH2CHO, and multiple transitions of SO and SO2 isotopologues showed tentative or definite detection toward a small subset of the cores. According to the chemical richness of the cores and high temperatures from the XCLASS fitting, we report the detection of four hot cores and one hot core candidate. With one new hot core detection in this study, the number of detected hot cores in the LMC increases to seven. Six out of seven hot cores detected in the LMC to date are located in the stellar bar region of this galaxy. These six hot cores show emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3OCHO, and CH3OCH3. The only known hot core in the LMC with no detection of COMs is located outside the bar region. The metallicity in the LMC presents a shallow gradient increasing from outer regions toward the bar. We suggest that the formation of hot molecular cores containing COMs ensues from the new generation of stars forming in the more metal-rich environment of the LMC bar.</description>

      <title>A quantification of the effects using different stellar population synthesis models for epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminosity and spectral energy distribution (SED) of high-$z$ galaxies are sensitive to the stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we study the effects of different SPS models on the measurements of high-$z$ galaxies and the budget of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization, by employing each of them in the semi-analytical galaxy formation model {\sc L-Galaxies 2020}. We find that the different SPS models lead to $\lesssim 0.5$ dex differences on the amplitudes of UV luminosity functions, while the two modes of the same SPS model with and without the inclusion of binary stars leads to similar UV luminosity functions at $z \ge 6$. Instead, the binary stars produce $\sim 40\%$ more ionizing photons than the single stars, while such differences are smaller than those caused by different SPS models, e.g. the BPASS model produces $\sim 100\%$ more ionizing photons than other models.</description>

      <title>Strong He I Emission Lines in High N/O Galaxies at $z \sim 6$ Identified in JWST Spectra: High He/H Abundance Ratios or High Electron Densities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HeI/H$\beta$-flux and He/H-abundance ratios in three JWST galaxies with significant constraints on N/O-abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at $z\sim 6$ mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from HeI$\lambda$4471 and HeII$\lambda$4686 to HeI$\lambda$7065, comparing with 68 local-dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-$z$ galaxies present strong HeI emission with HeI/H$\beta$ flux ratios generally larger than those of local-dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected HeI, HeII, and $2-3$ hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-$z$ galaxies show He overabundance He/H$\gtrsim 0.10$ or high electron density $n_\mathrm{e}\sim 10^{3-4}$ cm$^{-3}$ much larger than local values at low O/H, $12+\log \mathrm{(O/H)}=7-8$. In contrast, we obtain low He/H and $n_\mathrm{e}$ values for our local-dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-$z$ and local-dwarf galaxies are not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of 1) He overabundance and 2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation on the He/H-N/O or $n_\mathrm{e}$-N/O plane by the comparison of the high-$z$ and local-dwarf galaxies. The scenario 1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. The scenario 2) indicates that the strong helium lines are originated from the central dense clouds of the high-$z$ galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.</description>

      <title>On the time dependency of $a_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test one of the predictions of the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory on MOND. According to that theory, MOND's acceleration $a_0$ is not a universal quantity but depends on several parameters, including time. To check this prediction, we compare the dependency of $a_0$ from redshift, using the values of $a_0$ obtained in Marra et al. (2020) by carrying a Bayesian inference for 153 galaxies of the SPARC sample. Since this sample does not contain galaxies at large redshift, we have estimated $a_0$ from the data in Nestor Shachar et al. (2023). The SPARC sample, for small values of the redshift, in the redshift range $0.00032-0.032$ gives a correlation with $z$, while the Nestor Shachar et al. (2023) data, in the higher redshift range $0.5-2.5$ gives an anti-correlation with the redshift $z$. Both samples show a dependency of $a_0$ from $z$, although the uncertainties involved are large, especially for the high-redshift galaxies. The combined sample gives an overall correlation of $a_0$ with $z$. The different behavior at low and high redshift can be related to a change of the $a_0(z)$ with redshift, or to the lower precision with which the high-redshift value of $a_0$ are known.</description>

      <title>Consequences of a low-mass, high-pressure, star formation mode in early galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution X-ray spectra reveal hidden cooling flows depositing cold gas at the centres of massive nearby early-type galaxies with little sign of normal star formation. Optical observations are revealing that a bottom-heavy Initial Mass Function is common within the inner kpc of similar galaxies. We revive the possibility that a low-mass star formation mode is operating due to the high thermal pressure in the cooling flow, thus explaining the accumulation of low-mass stars. We further explore whether such a mode operated in early, high-redshift galaxies and has sporadically continued to the present day. The idea links observed distant galaxies with black holes which are ultramassive for their stellar mass, nearby red nuggets and massive early-type galaxies. Nearby elliptical galaxies may be red but they are not dead.</description>

      <title>The Role of Acetylene in the Chemical Evolution of Carbon Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe.

      <title>Unveiling the Bulge-Disc Structure, AGN Feedback, and Baryon Landscape in a Massive Spiral Galaxy with Mpc-Scale Radio Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the bulge-disc components and stellar mass distribution in the fast-rotating, highly massive spiral galaxy 2MASX~J23453268-0449256, distinguished by extraordinary radio jets extending to Mpc scales. Using high-resolution multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations and multi-parameter panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we derive estimates for the star formation rate, total baryonic mass in stars, and warm dust properties. Our findings, validated at a spatial resolution of approximately 100 pc, reveal a pseudo-bulge rather than a classical bulge and a small nuclear bar and resonant ring, challenging conventional models of galaxy formation. Additionally, the lack of tidal debris and the highly symmetric spiral arms within a rotationally supported stellar disc indicate a tranquil coevolution of the galactic disc and its supermassive black hole (SMBH). Significantly, the galaxy exhibits suppressed star formation in its center, potentially influenced by feedback from the central accreting SMBH with powerful radio jets. Detailed multi-wavelength studies of potential star-forming gas disclose that, while hot X-ray gas cools down in the galaxy's halo, new stars do not form in the center, likely due to feedback effects. This study raises questions about the efficient fueling and sustained collimated jet ejection activity in J2345-0449, underscoring the imperative need for a comprehensive understanding of its central black hole engine properties, which are presently lacking. The exceptional rarity of galaxies like 2MASX~J23453268-0449256 presents intriguing challenges in unraveling the physical processes responsible for their unique characteristics.</description>

      <title>On the original composition of the gas forming first-generation stars in clusters: insights from HST and JWST</title>

Abstract: Globular cluster (GC) stars composed of pristine material (first-generation, 1G, stars) are not chemically homogeneous, as they exhibit extended sequences in the "Chromosome Map" (ChM). Recent studies characterized 1G stars within the center of 55 Galactic GCs, revealing metallicity variations. Despite this progress, several unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the link between the 1G metallicity spread and factors such as the radial distance from the cluster center or the host GC parameters. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the extended 1G sequence phenomenon is exclusive to old Galactic GCs with multiple populations. This work addresses these open issues, examining 1G stars in different environments. First, we combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope photometry of the GC 47 Tucanae to study 1G stars at increasing distances from the cluster center. We find that metal-rich 1G stars are more centrally concentrated than metal-poor ones, suggesting a metallicity radial gradient. Additionally, the two groups of 1G stars share similar kinematics. Since our analysis focuses on giant stars in the cluster center and M dwarfs in external fields, we discuss the possibility that the metallicity distribution depends on stellar mass. Subsequently, we analyze HST multi-band photometry of two simple-population clusters, NGC 6791 and NGC 1783, revealing elongated sequences in the ChM associated with metallicity variations. Finally, we investigate the 1G color distribution in 51 GCs, finding no connections with the host cluster parameters. These results shed light on the complex nature of 1G stars, providing insights into the GC formation environment.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and astronomical discovery of cyanothioketene, NCCHCS, in the cold starless core TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of cyanothioketene, NCCHCS, in the laboratory and toward TMC-1. This transient species was produced through a discharge of a gas mixture of CH2CHCN and CS2 using argon as carrier gas, and its rotational spectrum between 9 and 40 GHz was characterized using a Balle-Flygare narrowband-type Fourier-transform microwave spectrometer. A total of 21 rotational transitions were detected in the laboratory, all of them exhibiting hyperfine structure induced by the spin of the N nucleus. The spectrum for NCCHCS was predicted in the domain of our line surveys using the derived rotational and distortion constants. The detection in the cold starless core TMC-1 was based on the QUIJOTE line survey performed with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. Twenty-three lines were detected with K_a=0, 1, and 2 and J_u=9 up to 14. The derived column density is (1.2+/-0.1)e11 cm-2 for a rotational temperature of 8.5+/-1 K. The abundance ratio of thioketene and its cyano derivative, H2CCS/NCCHCS, is 6.5+/-1.3. Although ketene is more abundant than thioketene by about 15 times, its cyano derivative NCCHCO surprisingly is not detected with a 3sigma upper level to the column density of 3.0e10 cm-2, which results in an abundance ratio H2CCO/NCCHCO &gt; 430. Hence, the chemistry of CN derivatives seems to be more favored for S-bearing than for O-bearing molecules. We carried out chemical modeling calculations and found that the gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions CCN + H2CS and CN + H2CCS could be a source of NCCHCS in TMC-1.</description>

      <title>The CO-dark molecular gas in the cold HI arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CO-dark molecular gas (DMG), which refers to the molecular gas not traced by CO emission, is crucial for the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). While the gas properties of DMG have been widely explored in the Solar neighborhood, whether or not they are similar in the outer disk regions of the Milky Way is still not well understood. In this Letter, we confirm the existence of DMG toward a cold HI arc structure at 13 kpc away from the Galactic center with both OH emission and HI narrow self-absorption (HINSA). This is the first detection of HINSA in the outer disk region, in which the HINSA fraction ($N_{\rm HINSA}$/$N_{\rm H_2}$ = 0.022$\pm$0.011) is an order of magnitude higher than the average value observed in nearby evolved dark clouds, but is consistent with that of the early evolutionary stage of dark clouds. The inferred H$_2$ column density from both extinction and OH emission ($N_{\rm H_2} \approx 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) is an order of magnitude higher than previously estimated. Although the ISM environmental parameters are expected to be different between the outer Galactic disk regions and the Solar neighborhood, we find that the visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$ = 0.19$\pm$0.03 mag), H$_2$-gas density ($n_{\rm H_2} = 91\pm46$ cm$^{-3}$), and molecular fraction (58\%$\pm$28\%) of the DMG are rather similar to those of nearby diffuse molecular clouds. The existence of DMG associated with the expanding HI supershell supports a scenario where the expansion of supershells may trigger the formation of molecular clouds within a crossing timescale of the shock wave ($\sim$10$^6$ yr).</description>

      <title>Radiative and mechanical energies in galaxies I. Contributions of molecular shocks and PDRs in 3C 326 N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Atomic and molecular lines in galaxies offer insights into energy budgets and feedback mechanisms. Aims: This study establishes a new framework for interpreting these lines and deducing energy budgets from observations. Methods: Atomic and molecular lines detected in a given object are assumed to result from the combination of distributions of shocks and photo-dissociation regions (PDR). Using the Paris-Durham shock code and the Meudon PDR code, emissions are computed over a wide range of parameters. Total emissions are calculated using probability distribution functions, with a defined distance metric based on observed and predicted intensity ratios. Results: We analyze the radio galaxy 3C 326 N, finding both shocks and PDRs necessary to explain the line fluxes. Viable solutions occur only at low densities ($\rm n_H &lt; 100 cm^{-3}$), indicating emission from diffuse interstellar matter. The optimal solution involves low-velocity shocks (5-20 km/s) in PDRs illuminated by UV radiation ten times stronger than in the solar neighborhood. The H$2$ 0-0 S(0) $28 \mu$m, [CII] $158 \mu$m, and [OI] $63 \mu$m lines originate from PDRs, while other H$2$ lines mostly come from shocks. The reprocessed radiative and mechanical energies are $\rm {L_{UV} = 6.3\times10^9 L\odot}$ and $\rm {L_K = 3.9\times10^8 L_\odot}$, respectively, in agreement with 3C 326 N's infrared luminosity, and consistent with 1% of the AGN jet kinetic power dissipated in the interstellar medium. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the radiative and mechanical energy budgets of galaxies can be derived from observations of atomic and molecular lines alone. It highlights the unexpected importance of the diffuse medium for 3C 326 N. Comparison with new JWST data for 3C 326 N shows striking agreement, opening new prospects for predicting and interpreting extragalactic observations.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the mid-infrared spectra of galaxies using ultraviolet to submillimeter photometry and Deep Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectra of galaxies are rich in features such as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and silicate dust features which give valuable information about the physics of galaxies and their evolution. For example they can provide information about the relative contribution of star formation and accretion from a supermassive black hole to the power output of galaxies. However, the mid-infrared spectra are currently available for a very small fraction of galaxies that have been detected in deep multi-wavelength surveys of the sky. In this paper we explore whether Deep Generative Network methods can be used to reconstruct mid-infrared spectra in the 5-35{\mu}m range using the limited multi-wavelength photometry in ~20 bands from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter which is typically available in extragalactic surveys. For this purpose we use simulated spectra computed with a combination of radiative transfer models for starbursts, active galactic nucleus (AGN) tori and host galaxies. We find that our method using Deep Generative Networks, namely Generative Adversarial Networks and Generative Latent Optimization models, can efficiently produce high quality reconstructions of mid-infrared spectra in ~70% of the cases.</description>

      <title>Impact of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter on Gas Properties at Very High Redshift: A Semi-Analytical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been proposed as potential candidates for dark matter (DM) and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Aims. Our objective is to delve into the distinct impact of PBHs on gas properties and their potential role in shaping the cosmic structure. Specifically, we aim to analyze the evolving gas properties while considering the presence of accreting PBHs with varying monochromatic masses and in different quantities. By studying the feedback effects produced by this accretion, our final goal is to assess the plausibility of PBHs as candidates for DM. Methods. We develop a semi-analytical model which works on top of the CIELO hydrodynamical simulation around $z\sim23$. This model enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of gas properties influenced by PBHs. Our focus lies on the temperature and hydrogen abundances, placing specific emphasis on the region closest to the halo center. We explore PBH masses of $1$, $33$, and $100~\Msun$, located within mass windows where a substantial fraction of DM could exist in the form of PBHs. We investigate various DM fractions composed of these PBHs ($f_{\rm{PBH}}&gt;10^{-4}$). Results. Our findings suggest that the existence of PBHs with masses of $1~\Msun$ and fractions greater than or equal to approximately $10^{-2}$ would be ruled out due to the significant changes induced in gas properties. The same applies to PBHs with a mass of $33~\Msun$ and $100~\Msun$ and fractions greater than approximately $10^{-3}$. These effects are particularly pronounced in the region nearest to the halo center, potentially leading to delayed galaxy formation within haloes.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: Too much, too young, too fast? Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ultra-deep, medium-resolution spectroscopic observations for 4 quiescent galaxies with log$_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})&gt;11$ at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$. These data were obtained with JWST NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey, which we introduce in this work. The first pair of galaxies are newly selected from PRIMER UDS imaging, both at $z=4.62$ and separated by $860$ pkpc on the sky, within a larger structure for which we confirm several other members. These galaxies formed at $z\simeq8-10$, and, despite their similar stellar masses, ages, and their proximity, they exhibit very different stellar metallicities, hinting at different formation pathways. These systems could plausibly merge by the present day to produce a local massive elliptical galaxy. The other 2 ultra-massive quiescent galaxies are previously known at $z=3.99$ and $3.19$, with the latter (ZF-UDS-7329) having been the subject of debate as potentially too old and too massive to be accommodated by the $\Lambda$-CDM halo-mass function. Both exhibit high stellar metallicities, and for ZF-UDS-7329 we are able to measure the $\alpha-$enhancement, obtaining [Mg/Fe] = $0.42^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. We finally evaluate whether these 4 galaxies are consistent with the $\Lambda$-CDM halo-mass function using an extreme value statistics approach. We find that the $z=4.62$ objects and the $z=3.19$ object are unlikely within our area under the assumption of standard stellar fractions ($f_*\simeq0.1-0.2$). However, these objects roughly align with the most massive galaxies expected under the assumption of 100 per cent conversion of baryons to stars ($f_*$=1). Our results suggest extreme galaxy formation physics during the first billion years, but no conflict with $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope observations of the globular cluster NGC 6397 and use them to extend to infrared wavelengths the characterization of the cluster's entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). The data allows us to probe fundamental astrophysical WD properties and to search for evidence in their colors for (or against) the existence of ancient planetary systems. The existing archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging data obtained ~18 years ago reach ultra-deep optical magnitudes (V~31) and allow us to derive a near-perfect separation between field and cluster members. We detect an apparent split in the lower part of the WD CS of NGC 6397. The red part of the WD CS, containing about 25% of the total, exhibits significant IR-excess of up to Delta m_F322W2 ~ 0.5 mag. These infrared excesses require both theoretical and observational follow-ups to confirm their veracity and to ascertain their true nature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- II. Discovery of Brown Dwarfs in NGC 6397 and Measurement of Age from the Brown Dwarf Cooling Sequence, using SANDee - a New Grid of Model Isochrones across the Hydrogen-Burning Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee - a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with effective temperatures of 1300-1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 +/- 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top-heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.</description>

      <title>$\textit{JWST}$ Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters$\,-\,$III. Multiple Populations along the low-mass Main Sequence stars of NGC$\,$6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to its exceptional near-infrared photometry, $\textit{JWST}$ can effectively contribute to the discovery, characterization, and understanding of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, especially at low masses where the $\textit{Hubble}$ $\textit{Space}$ $\textit{Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) faces limitations. This paper continues the efforts of the $\textit{JWST}$ GO-1979 program in exploring the faintest members of the globular cluster NGC$\,$6397. Here we show that the combination of $\textit{HST}$ and $\textit{JWST}$ data allows us to identify two groups of MS stars (MSa, the first-generation, and MSb, the second-generation group). We measured the ratio between the two groups and combined it with measurements from the literature focused on more central fields and more massive stars compared to our study. We find that the MSa and MSb stars are present in a $\approx$30-70 ratio regardless of the distance from the centre of the cluster and the mass of the stars used so far.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lagrangian bias estimators and the cumulant bias expansion</title>

Abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxies is a highly complex phenomenon currently impossible to predict deterministically. However, by using a statistical $\textit{bias}$ relation, it becomes possible to robustly model the average abundance of galaxies as a function of the underlying matter density field. Understanding the properties and parametric description of the bias relation is key to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys. Here, we contribute to this topic primarily in two ways: (1) We develop a new set of probabilistic estimators for bias parameters using the moments of the Lagrangian galaxy environment distribution. These estimators include spatial corrections at different orders to measure bias parameters independently of the damping scale. We report robust measurements of a variety of bias parameters for haloes, including the tidal bias and its dependence with spin at a fixed mass. (2) We propose an alternative formulation of the bias expansion in terms of "cumulant bias parameters" that describe the response of the logarithmic galaxy density to large-scale perturbations. We find that cumulant biases of haloes are consistent with zero at orders $n &gt; 2$. This suggests that: (i) previously reported bias relations at order $n &gt; 2$ are an artefact of the entangled basis of the canonical bias expansion; (ii) the convergence of the bias expansion may be improved by phrasing it in terms of cumulants; (iii) the bias function is very well approximated by a Gaussian -- an avenue which we explore in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Lagrangian Galaxy Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding $\textit{galaxy bias}$ -- that is the statistical relation between matter and galaxies -- is of key importance for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys. While the bias function $f$ is usually approximated through a parametric expansion, we show here, that it can also be measured directly from simulations in a non-parameteric way. Our measurements show that the Lagrangian bias function is very close to a Gaussian for halo selections of any mass. Therefore, we newly introduce a Gaussian bias model with several intriguing properties: (1) It predicts only strictly positive probabilities $f &gt; 0$ (unlike expansion models), (2) It has a simple analytic renormalized form and (3) It behaves gracefully in many scenarios where the classical expansion converges poorly. We show that the Gaussian bias model describes the galaxy environment distribution $p(\delta | \mathrm{g})$, the scale dependent bias function $f$ and the renormalized bias function $F$ of haloes and galaxies generally equally well or significantly better than a second order expansion with the same number of parameters. We suggest that a Gaussian bias approach may enhance the range of validity of bias schemes where the canonical expansion converges poorly and further, that it may make new applications possible, since it guarantees the positivity of predicted galaxy densities.</description>

      <title>A close binary lens revealed by the microlensing event Gaia20bof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last 25 years, hundreds of binary stars and planets have been discovered towards the Galactic Bulge by microlensing surveys. Thanks to a new generation of large-sky surveys, it is now possible to regularly detect microlensing events across the entire sky. The OMEGA Key Projet at the Las Cumbres Observatory carries out automated follow-up observations of microlensing events alerted by these surveys with the aim of identifying and characterizing exoplanets as well as stellar remnants. In this study, we present the analysis of the binary lens event Gaia20bof. By automatically requesting additional observations, the OMEGA Key Project obtained dense time coverage of an anomaly near the peak of the event, allowing characterization of the lensing system. The observed anomaly in the lightcurve is due to a binary lens. However, several models can explain the observations. Spectroscopic observations indicate that the source is located at $\le2.0$ kpc, in agreement with the parallax measurements from Gaia. While the models are currently degenerate, future observations, especially the Gaia astrometric time series as well as high-resolution imaging, will provide extra constraints to distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>Estimating microlensing parameters from observables and stellar isochrones with pyLIMASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pyLIMASS, a novel algorithm for estimating the physical properties of the lensing system in microlensing events. The main idea of pyLIMASS is to combine all available information regarding the microlensing event, defined as observables, and to estimate the parameter distributions of the system, such as the lens mass and distance. The algorithm is based on isochrones for the stars model and combine the observables using a Gaussian Mixtures approach. After describing the mathematical formalism and its implementation, we discuss the algorithm's performance on simulated and published events. Generally, the pyLIMASS estimations are in good agreement (i.e., within 1-$\sigma$) with the results of the selected published events, making it an effective tool to estimate the lens properties and their distribution. The applicability of the method was tested by using a catalog of realistically simulated events that could be observed by the future Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By solely using constraints from the Roman lightcurves and images, pyLIMASS estimates the masses of the lens of the Roman catalog with a median precision of 20% with almost no bias.</description>

      <title>How Rare are TESS Free-Floating Planets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kunimoto et al. claimed that a short-lived signal in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 61 database was caused by a microlensing event with a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet (FFP) lens. In this study, we investigate TESS's ability to detect microlensing FFPs by considering the detailed source information (e.g., distance and radius), the TESS photometric accuracy, and finite-source effects. Using the FFP mass function from microlensing surveys toward the Galactic bulge, we find that only $0.0018$ microlensing events are expected to be detected in TESS Sector 61 for the entire planetary mass range. The reported signal is unlikely to be a real microlensing event, which is consistent with the evidence from the long-term OGLE data that the signal was likely due to a stellar flare. By extrapolating our result to fainter stars until $T = 16$ mag and adopting a possible optimized search algorithm, we find that only $\sim 1$ FFP events can be detected in the entire TESS mission within the first 7 years. Significant improvments of our understanding of FFPs still requires future satellite missions, such as Roman and Earth 2.0, which can detect thousands of FFPs.</description>

      <title>A massive galaxy that formed its stars at $z \sim 11$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics and predicts a strong decline in the number of massive galaxies at early cosmic times. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies (stellar masses $&gt;10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) have now been observed as early as 1-2 billions years after the Big Bang; these are extremely constraining on theoretical models as they form 300-500 Myr earlier and only some models can form massive galaxies this early. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope of a massive quiescent galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at redshift 3.205 $\pm$ 0.005 that eluded deep ground-based spectrscopy, is significantly redder than typical and whose spectrum reveals features typical of much older stellar populations. Detailed modelling shows the stellar population formed around 1.5 billion years earlier in time (z ~ 11) at an epoch when dark matter halos of sufficient hosting mass have not yet assembled in the standard scenario. This observation may point to the presence of undetected populations of early galaxies and the possibility of significant gaps in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and/or the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>TREASUREHUNT: Transients and Variability Discovered with HST in the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) is a $&gt;$14 arcmin diameter field optimized for multi-wavelength time-domain science with JWST. It has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum both from the ground and from space, including with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As part of HST observations over 3 cycles (the "TREASUREHUNT" program), deep images were obtained with ACS/WFC in F435W and F606W that cover almost the entire JWST NEP TDF. Many of the individual pointings of these programs partially overlap, allowing an initial assessment of the potential of this field for time-domain science with HST and JWST. The cumulative area of overlapping pointings is ~88 arcmin$^2$, with time intervals between individual epochs that range between 1 day and 4$+$ years. To a depth of $m_{AB}$ $\simeq$ 29.5 mag (F606W), we present the discovery of 12 transients and 190 variable candidates. For the variable candidates, we demonstrate that Gaussian statistics are applicable, and estimate that ~80 are false positives. The majority of the transients will be supernovae, although at least two are likely quasars. Most variable candidates are AGN, where we find 0.42% of the general $z$ $&lt;$ 6 field galaxy population to vary at the $~3\sigma$ level. Based on a 5-year timeframe, this translates into a random supernova areal density of up to ~0.07 transients per arcmin$^2$ (~245 deg$^{-2}$) per epoch, and a variable AGN areal density of ~1.25 variables per arcmin$^2$ (~4500 deg$^{-2}$) to these depths.</description>

      <title>Distribution of merging and post-merging galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the incidence and spatial distribution of galaxies that are currently undergoing gravitational merging (M) or that have signs of a post merger (PM) in six galaxy clusters (A754, A2399, A2670, A3558, A3562, and A3716) within the redshift range, 0.05$\lesssim$$z$$\lesssim$0.08. To this aim, we obtained Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mosaics in $u^{\prime}$, $g^{\prime}$, and $r^{\prime}$-bands covering up to $3\times R_{200}$ of the clusters, reaching 28 mag/arcsec$^2$ surface brightness limits. We visually inspect $u^{\prime}$$g^{\prime}$$r^{\prime}$ color-composite images of volume-limited ($M_r &lt; -20$) cluster-member galaxies to identify whether galaxies are of M or PM types. We find 4% M-type and 7% PM-type galaxies in the galaxy clusters studied. By adding spectroscopic data and studying the projected phase space diagram (PPSD) of the projected clustocentric radius and the line-of-sight velocity, we find that PM-type galaxies are more virialized than M-type galaxies, having 1--5% point higher fraction within the escape-velocity region, while the fraction of M-type was $\sim$10% point higher than PM-type in the intermediate environment. Similarly, on a substructure analysis, M types were found in the outskirt groups, while PM types populated groups in ubiquitous regions of the PPSD. Adopting literature-derived dynamical state indicator values, we observed a higher abundance of M types in dynamically relaxed clusters. This finding suggests that galaxies displaying post-merging features within clusters likely merged in low-velocity environments, including cluster outskirts and dynamically relaxed clusters.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of planetary systems beyond our solar system has challenged established theories of planetary formation. Planetary orbits display a variety of unexpected architectures, and free-floating planets appear ubiquitous. The recent detection of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has added another puzzling layer. Here, through direct few-body simulations, we demonstrate that JuMBOs could arise from the ejection of double giant planets following a close encounter with a passing star, if the two planets are nearly aligned at the closest approach. These ejected JuMBOs typically possess an average semi-major axis approximately three times the orbital separation within their original planetary system and a high eccentricity, characterized by a superthermal distribution that sets them apart from those formed primordially. We estimate the JuMBO formation rate per planetary system in typical and densely populated clusters, revealing a significant environmental dependence. In dense clusters, this formation rate can reach a few percent for wide planetary systems. Comparative analysis of JuMBO rates and properties with current and forthcoming JWST observations across various environments promises insights into the conditions under which these giant planets formed in protoplanetary disks, thereby imposing constraints on theories of giant planet formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immense diversity of the galaxy population in the universe is believed to stem from their disparate merging and star formation histories, and multi-scale influences of diverse environments. No single causal factor of the initial state is known to explain how the galaxies formed and evolved to end up possessing such various traits as they have at the present epoch. However, several observational studies have revealed that the key physical properties of the observed galaxies in the local universe appeared to have a much simpler, lower-dimensional correlation structure than expected, the origin of which remains unexplained. Speculating that the emergence of such a simple correlation structure of the galaxy properties must be triggered by nature rather than by nurture, we explore if the present galaxy properties may be correlated with the initial precondition for protogalaxy angular momentum, $\tau$, and test it against the data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 hydrodynamic simulation. Employing Shannon's information theory, we discover that $\tau$ shares a significantly large amount of mutual information with each of the four basic traits of the TNG galaxies at $z=0$: the spin parameters, formation epochs, stellar-to-total mass ratios, and fraction of kinetic energy in ordered rotation. These basic traits except for the stellar-to-total mass ratios are found to contain even a larger amount of MI about $\tau$ than about the total masses and environments for the case of giant galaxies with $11.5\le \log[M_{\rm t}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})]&lt;13$. Our results imply that the initial condition of the universe must be more impactful on the galaxy evolution than conventionally thought.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 &lt; \log( m_{ax}/{eV}) &lt; -23$ to be less than $22\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 &lt; z &lt; 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($&lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) at $z &lt; 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>
