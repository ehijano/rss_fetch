      <title>Saturn's Evolutionary History and Seismology: Survival of Deep Stably Stratified Regions in Evolutionary Models of Saturn Consistent with Ring Seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in the modeling of the solar system giant planets, rapid progress has been made in understanding the remaining questions pertaining to their formation and evolution. However, this progress has largely neglected the significant constraints on the interior of Saturn's structure imposed by the observed oscillation frequencies in its rings. Here, we study initial conditions for Saturn's evolution that, after $4.56\;\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, give rise to planetary structures admitting oscillation frequencies consistent with those observed via Saturn's ring seismology. Restricting our attention to models without compact rocky cores, we achieve simultaneous good agreement with most observed properties of Saturn at the level of current evolutionary models and with key frequencies in the observed oscillation spectrum. Our preliminary work suggests that Saturn's interior stably stratified region may be moderately less extended ($\sim 0.4$--$0.5R_{\rm Sat}$) than previously thought, which is important for reconciling the seismic constraints with evolutionary models. We also tentatively find that the deep helium gradients inferred by previous, static structural modelling of Saturn's ring seismology may not be required to reproduce the observed seismology data.</description>

      <title>Visual inspection of potential exocomet transits identified through machine learning and statistical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore several ways to detect possible exocomet transits in the TESS (The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curves. The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to \b{eta} Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging Venus-like Worlds: Spectral, Polarimetric, and UV Diagnostics for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Brown Dwarf Desert: Four New Discoveries and a Unifying, Period-Coded Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.</description>

      <title>Ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the physics of some of the most extreme planetary atmospheres known. With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets. In this chapter we explore some of the key physical and chemical transitions that differentiate ultra-hot Jupiters from their colder counterparts and highlight the unique opportunities arising from probing their atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>ExoDNN: Boosting exoplanet detection with artificial intelligence. Application to Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine Gaia Data Release 3 and artificial intelligence to enhance the current statistics of substellar companions, particularly within regions of the orbital period vs. mass parameter space that remain poorly constrained by the radial velocity and transit detection methods. Using supervised learning, we train a deep neural network to recognise the characteristic distribution of the fit quality statistics corresponding to a Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for a non single star. We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample. We also identify synergies with future observatories, such as PLATO, and we propose a follow up strategy with the intention of investigating the most promising candidates among those samples.</description>

      <title>The asymmetric structure of the inner disc around HD 142527 A with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from &lt;1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\chi^2_\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\text{rim}\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\text{out}\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\text{rim,literature}\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing (~5 au) and short orbit ($P\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey IX: Isotopic evidence of a recent formation for Luhman 16AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinct formation pathways of directly-imaged exoplanets and isolated brown dwarfs might leave imprints in the inherited elemental and isotopic abundances, but such measurements require careful characterisation of the atmospheres. In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\mathrm{zz,A}\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\mathrm{zz,B}\sim10^{8.2}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\mathrm{[C/H]}\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}$ ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value. This suggests a recent inheritance and corroborates the relatively young age ($\sim500$ Myr) of Luhman 16AB as members of the Oceanus moving group.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric characterization of HIP 67522 b with VLT/CRIRES+. VLT/CRIRES+ suggests a heavier planet and hints at deuterium fractionation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young transiting exoplanets provide unique opportunities to probe planetary atmospheres during the critical early phases of evolution. HIP~67522~b, a 17~Myr old hot Jupiter with an extraordinarily low bulk density, represents an ideal target for high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to characterize the atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of HIP~67522~b using ground-based high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution spectra with VLT/CRIRES+ in the K2166 band during a transit on 30 January 2025. We applied cross-correlation techniques and Bayesian nested sampling retrievals to constrain molecular abundances, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics. We detect H$_2$O at 20$\sigma$ and CO at 5$\sigma$, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of $-2.9 \pm 0.2$~km~s$^{-1}$ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to $&lt;1.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ at 3$\sigma$, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 $\pm$ 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3$\sigma$ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H]~$= -0.8 \pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$\sigma$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of Pluto on Twotino Dynamics Through Their Mutual 4:3 Mean Motion Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The role of Pluto contributing to the long-term evolution of the trans-Neptunian region has been considered significant only over its neighboring Plutinos. However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect.
  Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population.
  Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects.
  Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales.
  Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations. Moreover, with current computational power, its exclusion from simulations can not be justified.</description>

      <title>Architectures of Planetary Systems II: Trends with Host Star Mass and Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current census of planetary systems displays a wide range of architectures. Extending earlier work, this paper investigates the correlation between our classification framework for these architectures and host stellar properties. Specifically, we explore how planetary system properties depend on stellar mass and stellar metallicity. This work confirms previously detected trends that jovian planets are less prevalent for low-mass and low-metallicity stars. We also find new, but expected trends such as that the total mass in planets increases with stellar mass, and that observed planetary system masses show an upper limit that is roughly consistent with expectations from the stability of circumstellar disks. We tentatively identify potential unique trends in the host stars of super-puffs and hot jupiters and a possible subdivision of the class of hot jupiter systems. In general, we find that system architectures are not overly dependent on host star properties.</description>

      <title>Probing Atmospheric Escape Through the Near-Infrared Helium Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most productive tracer of exoplanetary atmospheric escape is the measurement of excess absorption in the near-infrared metastable helium triplet during transits. Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints of tidal internal gravity wave dissipation in star-planet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.</description>

      <title>An Open Database of Lunar Regolith and Simulants Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lunar regolith, the layer of unconsolidated material covering the Moon's surface, is central to the science and technology developed for the Moon, notably related to in-situ science investigations, resource utilization, surface infrastructure, and mobility systems. However, data on lunar soil properties remain fragmented across decades of mission reports, often in formats that are difficult to access or interpret. We present a newly compiled database of lunar regolith physical and geotechnical properties, including data collected by direct in-situ measurements from crewed missions, estimates inferred from surface interactions on the Moon and using remote sensing, as well as laboratory analyses of samples returned to Earth. The data collected include, among others, the angle of internal friction and cohesion (both Mohr-Coulomb model parameters), bulk density, and static bearing capacity, extracted from Luna and Apollo-era historical mission documentation all the way to contemporary Lunar programs. The dataset specifies the type and location of the tests from which each value was obtained. Our database also includes parameters for lunar regolith simulants, providing a direct link between mission data and laboratory studies. In addition to centralizing this information, we developed a user interface that facilitates data retrieval, filtering, and visualization. This interface enables users to generate customized plots for comparative analysis. Developed in an open-science perspective, it is designed to evolve in response to the community's needs. The database and its associated tools significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of lunar regolith and simulants data for scientific and engineering research.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Orbital Landscape of Perturbing Planet Solutions for Single-Planet Systems with TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are now thousands of single-planet systems observed to exhibit transit timing variations (TTVs), yet we largely lack any interpretation of the implied masses responsible for these perturbations. Even when assuming these TTVs are driven by perturbing planets, the solution space is notoriously multi-modal with respect to the perturber's orbital period and there exists no standardized procedure to pinpoint these modes, besides from blind brute force numerical efforts. Using $N$-body simulations with TTVFast and focusing on the dominant periodic signal in the TTVs, we chart out the landscape of these modes and provide analytic predictions for their locations and widths, providing the community with a map for the first time: the TTV circus tent diagram. We then introduce an approach for modeling single-planet TTVs in the low-eccentricity regime, by splitting the orbital period space into a number of uniform prior bins over which there aren't these degeneracies. We show how one can define appropriate orbital period priors for the perturbing planet in order to sufficiently sample the complete parameter space. We demonstrate, analytically, how one can explain the numerical simulations using first-order near mean-motion resonance super-periods, the synodic period, and their aliases -- the expected dominant TTV periods in the low-eccentricity regime. Using a Bayesian framework, we then present a method for determining the optimal solution between TTVs induced by a perturbing planet and TTVs induced by a moon.</description>

      <title>Inside-Out Planet Formation. VIII. Onset of Planet Formation and the Transition Disk Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim 0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1~au. This model may also provide an explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</description>
