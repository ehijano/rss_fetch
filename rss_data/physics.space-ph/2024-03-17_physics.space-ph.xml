      <title>Field Line Curvature Scattering in the Dayside Off-Equatorial Minima Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field line curvature (FLC) scattering is an effective mechanism for collisionless particle scattering. In the terrestrial magnetosphere, the FLC scattering plays an essential role in shaping the outer boundary of protons radiation belt, the rapid decay of ring current, and the formation of proton isotropic boundary (IB). However, previous studies have yet to adequately investigate the influence of FLC scattering on charged particles in the Earth's dayside magnetosphere, particularly in the off-equatorial magnetic minima regions. This study employs T89 magnetic field model to investigate the impacts of FLC scattering on ring current protons in the dayside magnetosphere, with a specific focus on the off-equatorial minimum regions. We analyze the spatial distributions of single and dual magnetic minima regions, adiabatic parameter, and pitch angle diffusion coefficients due to FLC scattering as functions of $Kp$. The results show that the effects of FLC scattering are significant not only on the dusk and dawn sides but also in the off-equatorial minima regions on the noon. Additionally, we investigate the role of dipole tilt angle in the hemispheric asymmetry of FLC scattering effects. The dipole tilt angle controls the overall displacement of the dayside magnetosphere, resulting in different FLC scattering effects in the two hemispheres. Our study holds significance for understanding the FLC scattering effects in the off-equatorial region of Earth's dayside magnetosphere and for constructing a more accurate dynamic model of particles.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Geoffective Events from Solar Wind Data and Evaluating the Most Predictive Features through Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the prediction of geomagnetic disturbances by exploiting machine learning techniques. Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$ to $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the kinetic properties of proton and alpha beams in the Alfv\'enic wind observed by SWA-PAS onboard Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10489</link>

Abstract: The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather than employing the conventional biMaxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>

Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Wave Generation by Flare-Accelerated Ions and Implications for 3He Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic ($T_{\parallel} &gt; T_{\perp}$), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and non-zero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of $^3$He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of $^3$He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated $^3$He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of $^3$He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of $^4$He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of $^3$He observed in impulsive flares.</description>
