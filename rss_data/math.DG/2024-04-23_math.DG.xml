      <title>The Ricci flow and isoperimetric inequalities on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the connection between the Ricci flow and isoperimetric inequalities on surfaces which are diffeomorphic to the $2$-sphere. We prove that the Cheeger isoperimetric constant is non-decreasing under Ricci flow on topological $2$-spheres. A topological $2$-sphere with non-trivial curvature is exhibited which is a counterexample to the hypothesis that the Cheeger constant is a strictly increasing function of the Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Some Classifications for Gauss Map of Tubular Hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{E}^{4}_{1}$ Concerning Linearized Operators $\mathcal{L}_{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we deal with the Gauss map of tubular hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space concerning the linearized operators $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ (Cheng-Yau) and $\mathcal{L}_{2}$. We obtain the $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ (Cheng-Yau) operator of the Gauss map of tubular hypersurfaces that are formed as the envelope of a family of pseudo hyperspheres {or pseudo hyperbolic hyperspheres} whose centers lie on timelike or spacelike curves with non-null Frenet vectors in $\mathbb{E}^{4}_{1}$ and give some classifications for these hypersurfaces which have generalized $\mathcal{L}_{k}$ 1-type Gauss map, first kind $\mathcal{L}_{k}$-pointwise 1-type Gauss map, second kind $\mathcal{L}_{k}$-pointwise 1-type Gauss map and $\mathcal{L}_{k}$-harmonic Gauss map, $k\in\{1,2\}$.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Penrose Inequality for Cohomogeneity One Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the spacetime Penrose inequality for asymptotically flat $2(n+1)$-dimensional initial data sets for the Einstein equations, which are invariant under a cohomogeneity one action of $\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$. Analogous results are obtained for asymptotically hyperbolic initial data that arise as spatial hypersurfaces in asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, it is shown that with the dominant energy condition, the total mass is bounded below by an explicit function of the outermost apparent horizon area. Furthermore, the inequality is saturated if and only if the initial data isometrically embed into a Schwarzschild(-AdS) spacetime. This generalizes the only previously known case of the conjectured spacetime Penrose inequality, established under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Additionally, in the time symmetric case, we observe that the inequality holds for $4(n+1)$-dimensional and 16-dimensional initial data invariant under cohomogeneity one actions of $\mathrm{Sp}(n+1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(9)$, respectively, thus treating the inequality for all cohomogeneity one actions in this regime.</description>

      <title>Metric operator and geodesic orbit property for a standard homogeneous Finsler metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the metric operator for a compact homogeneous Finsler space, and use it to investigate the geodesic orbit property. We define the notion of standard homogeneous $(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)$-metric which generalizes the notion of standard homogeneous $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-metric. We classify all connected simply connected homogeneous manifold $G/H$ with a compact connected simple Lie group $G$ and two irreducible summands in its isotropy representation, such that there exists a standard homogeneous $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-metric which is g.o. but not naturally reductive on $G/H$. We also prove that on a generalized Wallach space which is not a product of three symmetric spaces, any standard homogeneous $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$-metric $F$ with respect to the canonical decomposition is g.o. on $G/H$ if and only if $F$ is a normal homogeneous Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Witten instanton complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds with K\"ahler wedge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Witten instanton complexes for K\"ahler Hamiltonian Morse functions on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge K\"ahler metrics satisfying a local conformally totally geodesic condition. We use this to extend Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities for the $L^2$ cohomology of Dolbeault complexes, deriving versions for Poincar\'e Hodge polynomials, the spin Dirac and signature complexes for which we prove rigidity results, in particular establishing the rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham cohomology for these circle actions. We generalize formulas studied by Witten and Gibbons-Hawking for the equivariant signature and extend formulas used to compute NUT charges of gravitational instantons. We discuss conjectural inequalities extending known Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas for other cohomology theories including those of Baum-Fulton-Quart. As far as the author is aware this article contains the first extension of Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities to singular spaces, and the first results on rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham and Dolbeault cohomology for the actions studied on stratified pseudomanifolds</description>

      <title>A Minkowski type inequality in warped cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Minkowski type inequality for weakly mean convex and star-shaped hypersurfaces in warped cylinders which are asymptotically flat or hyperbolic. In particular, we show that this sharp inequality holds for outward minimizing hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold or the hyperbolic space using the weak solution of the inverse mean curvature flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to investigate the existence of Frenet helices which are polyharmonic of order $r$, shortly, $r$-harmonic. We shall obtain existence, non-existence and classification results. More specifically, we obtain a complete classification of proper $r$-harmonic helices into the $3$-dimensional solvable Lie group Sol$_3$. Next, we investigate the existence of proper $r$-harmonic helices into Bianchi-Cartan-Vranceanu spaces and, in this context, we find new examples. Finally, we shall establish some non-existence results both for Frenet curves and Frenet helices of order $n \geq 4$ when the ambient space is the Euclidean sphere $\s^m$.</description>

      <title>CMC foliations on Euclidean spaces are minimal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give complete answers to some classical problems and conjectures on differential geometry (of foliations). For instance, we give a complete positive answer to the classical conjecture that states that every foliation on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by (possibly varying) CMC hypersurfaces is a foliation by minimal hypersurfaces. Moreover, if $n\leq 4$ such a CMC foliation must consist of parallel hyperplanes. We prove also that such conjecture holds true in much more general situations, for instance, when the ambient space is a complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature. We prove also that for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with sectional curvature bounded from below by $-K_0\leq 0$, then the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\leq \sqrt{K_0}$. This gives a complete positive answer to a conjecture due to Meeks III, P\'erez and Ros. We give some answers to several other problems.</description>

      <title>Constant energy families of harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a negatively curved manifold $M$ and a continuous map $\psi:\Sigma\to M$ from a closed surface $\Sigma$, we study complex submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ such that the harmonic maps $\{h_X:X\to M\text{ for }X\in\mathcal{S}\}$ in the homotopy class of $\psi$ all have equal energy. When $M$ is real analytic with negative Hermitian sectional curvature, we show that for any such $\mathcal{S}$, there exists a closed Riemann surface $Y$, such that any $h_X$ for $X\in\mathcal{S}$ factors as a holomorphic map $\phi_X:X\to Y$ followed by a fixed harmonic map $h:Y\to M$. This answers a question posed by both Toledo and Gromov. As a first application, we show a factorization result for harmonic maps from normal projective varieties to $M$. As a second application, we study homomorphisms from finite index subgroups of mapping class groups to $\pi_1(M)$.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-Riemannian Ricci-parallel Lie groups which are not Einstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study left invariant pseudo-Riemannian Ricci-parallel metrics on connected Lie groups which are not Einstein. Following a result of Boubel and B\'{e}rard Bergery, there are two typical types of such metrics, which are characterized by the minimal polynomial of the Ricci operator. Namely, its form is either $(X-\alpha)(X-\bar{\alpha})$ (type I), where $\alpha\in \mathbb{C}\setminus \mathbb{R}$, or $X^{2}$ (type II). Firstly, we obtain a complete description of Ricci-parallel metrics of type I. In particular, such a Ricci-parallel metric is uniquely determined by an Einstein metric and an invariant symmetric parallel complex structure up to isometry and scaling. Then we study Ricci-parallel metric Lie algebras of type II by using double extension process. Surprisingly, we find that every double extension of a metric Abelian Lie algebra is Ricci-parallel and the converse holds for Lorentz Ricci-parallel metric nilpotent Lie algebras of type II. Moreover, we construct infinitely many new explicit examples of Ricci-parallel metric Lie algebras which are not Einstein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a connection between the complex landslide flow, defined on a pair of Teichm\"uller spaces, and the integrable system method's approach to harmonic maps into a symmetric space. We will prove that the holonomy of the complex landslide flow can be derived from the holonomy of the family of flat connections determined by a harmonic map into the hyperbolic two-space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gromov used convex integration to prove that any closed orientable three-manifold equipped with a volume form admits three divergence-free vector fields which are linearly independent at every point. We provide an alternative proof of this (inspired by Seiberg-Witten theory) using geometric properties of eigenspinors in three dimensions. In fact, our proof shows that for any Riemannian metric, one can find three divergence-free vector fields such that at every point they are orthogonal and have the same non-zero length.</description>

      <title>Nirenberg problem on high dimensional spheres: Blow up with residual mass phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the analysis of the subcritical approximation of the Nirenberg problem on spheres recently conducted in \cite{MM19, MM}. Specifically, we delve into the scenario where the sequence of blowing up solutions exhibits a non-zero weak limit, which necessarily constitutes a solution of the Nirenberg problem itself. Our focus lies in providing a comprehensive description of such blowing up solutions, including precise determinations of blow-up points and blow-up rates. Additionally, we compute the topological contribution of these solutions to the difference in topology between the level sets of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional. Such an analysis is intricate due to the potential degeneracy of the involved solutions. We also provide a partial converse, wherein we construct blowing up solutions when the weak limit is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Curvature and sharp growth rates of log-quasimodes on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new optimal estimates for the $L^2(M)\to L^q(M)$, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, operator norms of spectral projection operators associated with spectral windows $[\lambda,\lambda+\delta(\lambda)]$, with $\delta(\lambda)=O((\log\lambda)^{-1})$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\ge2$ all of whose sectional curvatures are nonpositive or negative. We show that these two different types of estimates are saturated on flat manifolds or manifolds all of whose sectional curvatures are negative. This allows us to classify compact space forms in terms of the size of $L^q$-norms of quasimodes for each Lebesgue exponent $q\in (2,q_c]$, even though it is impossible to distinguish between ones of negative or zero curvature sectional curvature for any $q&gt;q_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the upper bounds for the $L^2$-norms of $L^1$-normalized quasimodes that we obtained in [9] are always sharp on any compact space form. This allows us to characterize compact manifolds of constant sectional curvature using the decay rates of lower bounds of $L^1$-norms of $L^2$-normalized log-quasimodes fully resolving a problem initiated by the second author and Zelditch [15]. We are also able to characterize such manifolds by the concentration of quasimodes near periodic geodesics as measured by $L^2$-norms over thin geodesic tubes.</description>

      <title>Brane mechanics and gapped Lie n-algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw a parallel between the BV/BRST formalism for higher-dimensional ($\ge 2$) Hamiltonian mechanics and higher notions of torsion and basic curvature tensors for generalized connections in specific Lie $n$-algebroids based on homotopy Poisson structures. The gauge systems we consider include Poisson sigma models in any dimension and ``generalised R-flux'' deformations thereof, such as models with an $(n+2)$-form-twisted R-Poisson target space. Their BV/BRST action includes interaction terms among the fields, ghosts and antifields whose coefficients acquire a geometric meaning by considering twisted Koszul multibrackets that endow the target space with a structure that we call a gapped almost Lie $n$-algebroid. Studying covariant derivatives along $n$-forms, we define suitable polytorsion and basic polycurvature tensors and identify them with the interaction coefficients in the gauge theory, thus relating models for topological $n$-branes to differential geometry on Lie $n$-algebroids.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning as Ricci Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Integration of first-order ODEs by Jacobi fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of vector fields enabling the integration of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. These vector fields are not, in general, Lie point symmetries. The results are based on a relation between 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and the integrability of first-order ODEs, which was established in a previous work of the authors. An integration procedure is provided, together with several examples to illustrate it. A connection between integrating factors of first-order ODEs and Schr\"odinger-type equations is highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0801.2057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss two generalizations of Lie groupoids. One consists of Lie $n$-groupoids defined as simplicial manifolds with trivial $\pi_{k\geq n+1}$. The other consists of stacky Lie groupoids $\cG\rra M$ with $\cG$ a differentiable stack. We build a 1-1 correspondence between Lie 2-groupoids and stacky Lie groupoids up to a certain Morita equivalence. We prove this in a general set-up so that the statement is valid in both differential and topological categories. \Equivalences of higher groupoids in various categories are also described.</description>

Abstract: The paper will study a new quarter-symmetric non-metric connection on a generalized Riemannian manifold. It will determine the relations that the torsion tensor satisfies. The exterior derivative of the skew-symmetric part $F$ of generalized metric $G$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection coincides with that of skew-symmetric part $F$ with respect to quarter-symmetric non-metric connection, which implies that the even-dimensional manifold endowed with $F$ is symplectic manifold if and only if it is closed with respect to quarter-symmetric non-metric connection. The linearly independent curvature tensors of this connection and its dual connection are determined and the properties of these tensors are discussed. Finally, the condition is given that the connection should be dual symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01600v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new examples of compact ECS manifolds, that is, of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor that are neither conformally flat nor locally symmetric. Every ECS manifold has rank 1 or 2, the rank being the dimension of a distinguished null parallel distribution discovered by Olszak. Previously known examples of compact ECS manifolds, in every dimension greater than 4, were all of rank 1, geodesically complete, and none of them locally homogeneous. By contrast, our new examples -- all of them geodesically incomplete -- realize all odd dimensions starting from 5 and are this time of rank 2, as well as locally homogeneous.</description>

Abstract: We define the hyperbolic Yamabe flow and we obtain some properties of its stationary solutions, namely, of hyperbolic Yamabe solitons. We also consider immersed submanifolds as hyperbolic Yamabe solitons and we prove that, under certain assumptions, a hyperbolic Yamabe soliton hypersurface is pseudosymmetric or metallic shaped. Further we characterize the hyperbolic Yamabe soliton factor manifolds of a multiply twisted, multiply warped, doubly warped, and warped product manifold, and we provide a classification for a complete gradient hyperbolic Yamabe soliton factor manifold. Finally, we determine the conditions when the factor manifolds are hyperbolic Yamabe solitons if the manifold is a hyperbolic Yamabe soliton and we illustrate this result for the Robertson--Walker spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is an open convex cone locally defined by a finite number of linear inequalities.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <title>A Weitzenb\"ock formula on Sasakian holomorphic bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work seeks to advance the understanding of the smooth structure of the moduli space of self-dual contact instantons (SDCI) on Sasakian 7-manifolds M. A neighborhood of a smooth point of M is locally modeled on the first cohomological group of an elliptic complex (1.4). There is a cohomological obstruction to the smoothness for the moduli space, in terms of a second basic cohomological group, in this paper we study conditions under which this obstruction disappears, by computing a Weitzenb\"ock formula and using a Bochner-type method to obtain a vanishing theorem. Given an SDCI on a Sasakian bundle E, we find sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the obstruction in the positivity of a couple of operators R and F depending on the curvatures of the connection and the Riemann curvature of the Sasakian metric g. In particular, we find that if M is transversely Ricci positive and F positive, the moduli space of SDCI must be smooth. However, in general, the operator F is not positive definite and we describe bundles over the Stiefel manifold for which it is the case. Finally, we show that when the energy of the curvature is less than the first non-zero eigenvalue of RicT the obstruction vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric multilevel optimization approach that smoothly incorporates box constraints. Given a box constrained optimization problem, we consider a hierarchy of models with varying discretization levels. Finer models are accurate but expensive to compute, while coarser models are less accurate but cheaper to compute. When working at the fine level, multilevel optimisation computes the search direction based on a coarser model which speeds up updates at the fine level. Moreover, exploiting geometry induced by the hierarchy the feasibility of the updates is preserved. In particular, our approach extends classical components of multigrid methods like restriction and prolongation to the Riemannian structure of our constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain new improved spectral projection estimates on manifolds of non-positive curvature, including sharp ones for relatively large spectral windows for general tori. Our results are stronger than those in an earlier work of the first and third authors [6], and the arguments have been greatly simplified. We more directly make use of pointwise estimates that are implicit in the work of Berard [2] and avoid the use of weak-type spaces that were used in the previous works [6] and [22]. We also simplify and strengthen the bilinear arguments by exploiting the use of microlocal $L^2\to L^{q_c}$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimates and avoiding the of $L^2\to L^2$ ones as in earlier results. This allows us to prove new results for manifolds of negative curvature and some new sharp estimates for tori. We also have new and improved techniques in two dimensions for general manifolds of non-positive curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the semisimple orbits of a Vinberg $\theta$-representation. First we take the complex numbers as base field. By a case by case analysis we show a technical result stating the equality of two sets of hyperplanes, one corresponding to the restricted roots of a Cartan subspace, the other corresponding to the complex reflections in the (little) Weyl group. The semisimple orbits have representatives in a finite number of sets that correspond to reflection subgroups of the (little) Weyl group. One of the consequences of our technical result is that the elements in a fixed such set all have the same stabilizer in the acting group. Secondly we study what happens when the base field is the real numbers. We look at Cartan subspaces and show that the real Cartan subspaces can be classified by the first Galois cohomology set of the normalizer of a fixed real Cartan subspace. In the real case the orbits can be classified using Galois cohomology. However, in order for that to work we need to know which orbits have a real representative. We show a theorem that characterizes the orbits of homogeneous semisimple elements that do have such a real representative. This closely follows and generalizes a theorem from \cite{bgl}.</description>

Abstract: On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with Anosov geodesic flow, the problem of recovering a connection from the knowledge of traces of its holonomies along primitive closed geodesics is known as the holonomy inverse problem. In this paper, we prove H\"older type stability estimates for this inverse problem: 1) locally, near generic connections; 2) globally, for line bundles, and for vector bundles satisfying a certain low-rank assumption over negatively curved base $(M, g)$. The proofs are based on a combination of microlocal analysis along with a new non-Abelian approximate Livsic Theorem in hyperbolic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We produce infinitely many distinct irreducible smooth 4-manifolds homeomorphic to #(2m+1)(CP^2 # -CP^2) and #(2n+1)(S^2 x S^2), respectively, for each m&gt;3 and n&gt;4. These provide the smallest exotic closed simply connected 4-manifolds with signature zero known to date, and in each one of these homeomorphism classes, we get minimal symplectic 4-manifolds. Our novel exotic 4-manifolds are derived from fairly special small Lefschetz fibrations we build via positive factorizations in the mapping class group, with spin and non-spin monodromies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>
