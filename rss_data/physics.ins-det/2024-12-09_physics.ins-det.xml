      <title>Organic electronic-based neutron detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades organic electronics has entered the mainstream of consumer electronics, driven by innovations in scalability and low power applications, and low-cost fabrication methods. The potential for using organic semiconductor electronic devices as radiation detectors, and in particular for neutron detection is reported. We report results of laboratory tests using alpha particles as well as the response to thermal and fast neutrons covering the energy range 0.025 eV to 16.5 MeV. GEANT4 simulations are used to provide a detailed understanding of the performance and potential of this emerging technology for radiation detection.</description>

      <title>YSO implantation detector for beta-delayed neutron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A segmented-scintillator-based implantation detector was developed to study the energy distribution of beta-delayed neutrons emitted from exotic isotopes. The detector comprises a 34 $\times$ 34 YSO scintillator coupled to an 8 $\times$ 8 Position-Sensitive Photo-Multiplier Tube (PSPMT) via a tapered light guide. The detector was used at RIBF, RIKEN, for time-of-flight-based neutron spectroscopy measurement in the $^{78}$Ni region. The detector provides the position and timing resolution necessary for ion-beta correlations and ToF measurements. The detector provides a high $\sim$ 80 $\%$ beta-detection efficiency and a sub-nanosecond timing resolution. This contribution discusses the details of the design, operation, implementation, and analysis developed to obtain neutron time-of-flight spectrum and the analysis methods in the context of neutron-rich nuclei in the $^{78}$Ni region.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ATLAS ITk Pixel Detector Material via Multiple Scattering of Positrons at the CERN PS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ITk is a new silicon tracker for the ATLAS experiment designed to increase detector resolution, readout capacity, and radiation hardness, in preparation for the larger number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions at the High Luminosity LHC. This paper presents the first direct measurement of the material budget of an ATLAS ITk pixel module, performed at a testbeam at the CERN Proton Synchrotron via the multiple scattering of low energy positrons within the module volume. Using a four plane telescope of thin monolithic pixel detectors from the MALTA collaboration, scattering datasets were recorded at a beam energy of $1.2\,\text{GeV}$. Kink angle distributions were extracted from tracks derived with and without information from the ITk pixel module, and were fit to extract the RMS scattering angle, which was converted to a fractional radiation length $x/X_0$. The average $x/X_0$ across the module was measured as $[0.89 \pm 0.01 \text{ (resolution)} \pm 0.01 \text{ (subtraction)} \pm 0.08 \text{ (beam momentum band)}]\%$, which agrees within uncertainties with an estimate of $0.88\%$ derived from material component expectations.</description>

      <title>A method for measuring deviation from Lambert diffuse scattering law of ultracold neutrons on material walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the motion of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) is crucial for assessing their losses, accurately measuring their lifetime, and describing other experiments. In material traps, it is necessary to account not only for specular but also for diffuse elastic reflection of UCNs from the trap walls. Typically, the Lambert cosine law is used to describe the angular distribution of diffusely scattered neutrons. However, this law lacks a rigorous theoretical derivation and is often violated. In our work, we propose an experiment to measure the deviation of the angular distribution of UCNs during diffuse scattering from the Lambert law. This deviation can be determined by the difference in the number of neutrons exiting through the central and end windows of a long narrow UCN trap. Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to a possible experiment have been performed, demonstrating a significant effect for different trap geometries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and performance of wave union TDC implemented in a Lattice CertusPro-NX FPGA is discussed. This FPGA is available for radiation tolerant applications. The TDC is implemented with 16-channels and a 200 MHz reference clock. Each channel is able to record at an event rate of &gt; 1 MHz. The performance of the TDC is assessed over voltage and temperature. Typical TDC performance has a resolution of 10.9 ps. Typical INL is +/-3 LSB peak-to-peak. Typical DNL is (+1.13,-0.77) LSB. Typical differential performance between two channels is 20 ps (1-sigma).</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>

      <title>The PRISMA-36 array for studying variations of the thermal neutron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 2012 to 2023, the PRISMA-32 array was in operation at the Experimental Complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow). The purpose of the array was to study extensive air showers by detecting the air-shower neutron and electron-photon components using unshielded neutron detectors. To expand the capabilities of this facility, including for the study of cosmic and geophysical phenomena with a neutron flux, its upgrade was carried out. During the upgrade, a dedicated measuring channel for studying variations of the neutron background and the processes affecting these variations was created. To achieve this, the photomultipliers, the integrating amplifiers, the digitalizing electronics and the high-voltage power supply system were replaced. The paper describes the structure of the upgraded array, which was named PRISMA-36, and presents the results of studying the characteristics of the main elements of its "variation" channel. A method for identifying signals caused by neutron capture and the determined criteria for their selection are discussed. An example of a Forbush decrease, caused by a X1.1-class flare and recorded with the variation channel of the PRISMA-36 array, is given.</description>

      <title>First experiences with the LHCb heterogeneous software trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2022, the LHCb detector has been taking both proton-proton and lead-ion data at the LHC collision rate using a fully software-based trigger. This has been implemented on GPUs at its first stage and CPUs at its second. The setup allows for reconstruction, alignment, calibration and selections to be performed online -- known as the real time analysis paradigm. As well as this, physics analyses are performed using the output of online reconstruction with early results shown using data taken in 2022.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the sensitivity of a temperature sensor based on germanium-vacancy color center (GeV) in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature sensors based on the GeV color center in diamond are gaining considerable attention in both scientific and industrial fields. For widespread industrial adoption, however, these sensors need a design that is as simple and cost-effective as possible. The original sensor design relied on measuring the spectral characteristics of the zero-phonon line. Recently, a modified approach was introduced, which involves splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining temperature based on the ratio of the two resulting signals. In this analysis, we provide a detailed comparison of both methods. At room temperature, the two methods show comparable performance, with slight variations depending on component quality. However, at temperatures around 300 {\deg}C, the new method's performance is estimated to be nearly twice that of the original, provided optimal filter parameters are used. Additionally, the sensitivity of the new method remains roughly consistent with its performance at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Multi-Calorimetry in Light-based Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino detectors are among the largest photon detection instruments, built to capture scarce photons upon energy deposition. Many discoveries in neutrino physics, including the neutrino itself, are inseparable from the advances in photon detection technology, particularly in photo-sensors and readout electronics, to yield ever higher precision and richer detection information. The measurement of the energy of neutrinos, referred to as calorimetry, can be achieved in two distinct approaches: photon-counting, where single-photon can be counted digitally, and photon-integration, where multi-photons are aggregated and estimated via analogue signals. The energy is pursued today to reach permille level systematics control precision in ever-vast volumes, exemplified by experiments like JUNO. The unprecedented precision brings to the foreground the systematics due to calorimetric response entanglements in energy, position and time that were negligible in the past, thus driving further innovation in calorimetry. This publication describes a novel articulation that detectors can be endowed with multiple photon detection systems. This multi-calorimetry approach opens the notion of dual-calorimetry detector, consisting of both photon-counting and photon-integration systems, as a cost-effective evolution from the single calorimetry setups used over several decades for most experiments so far. The dual-calorimetry design exploits unique response synergies between photon-counting and photon-integration systems, including correlations and cancellations in calorimetric responses, to maximise the mitigation of response entanglements, thereby yielding permille-level high-precision calorimetry.</description>
