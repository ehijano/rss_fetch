      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group Approach Based on the Coupled-Cluster Downfolded Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method has become a prominent tool for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems characterized by dominant static correlation effects. However, capturing the full scope of electronic interactions, especially for complex chemical processes, requires an accurate treatment of static and dynamic correlation effects, which remains a significant challenge in computational chemistry. This study presents a new approach integrating a Hermitian coupled-cluster-based downfolding technique, incorporating dynamic correlation into active-space Hamiltonians, with the DMRG method. By calculating the ground-state energies of these effective Hamiltonians via DMRG, we achieve a more comprehensive description of electronic structure. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this combined method for advancing simulations of strongly correlated systems using benchmark calculations on molecular systems, including N$_2$, benzene, and tetramethyleneethane (TME).</description>

      <title>Two-component relativistic equation-of-motion coupled cluster for electron ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of relativistic ionization-potential (IP) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) with up to 3-hole--2-particle (3h2p) excitations that makes use of the molecular mean-field exact two-component (mmfX2C) framework and the full Dirac--Coulomb--Breit Hamiltonian. The closed-shell nature of the reference state in an X2C-IP-EOMCC calculation allows for accurate predictions of spin-orbit splittings in open-shell molecules without breaking degeneracies, as would occur in an excitation-energy EOMCC calculation carried out directly on an unrestricted open-shell reference. We apply X2C-IP-EOMCC to the ground and first excited state of the HCCX$^+$ (X = Cl, Br, I) cations, where it is demonstrated that a large basis set (\emph{i.e.}, quadruple-zeta quality) and 3h2p correlation effects are necessary for accurate absolute energetics. The maximum error in calculated adiabatic IPs is on the order of 0.1 eV, whereas spin-orbit splittings themselves are accurate to $\approx 0.01$ eV, as compared to experimentally obtained values.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of the Random Phase Approximation with Domain-based Local Pair Natural Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of the random phase approximation (RPA) for molecular systems within the domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) framework. With optimized parameters, DLPNO-RPA achieves approximately 99.9% accuracy in the total correlation energy compared to a canonical implementation, enabling highly accurate reaction energies and potential energy surfaces to be computed while substantially reducing computational costs. As an application, we demonstrate the capability of DLPNO-RPA to efficiently calculate basis set-converged binding energies for a set of large molecules, with results showing excellent agreement with high-level reference data from both coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo. This development paves the way for the routine use of RPA-based methods in molecular quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Parallel Multi-Coordinate Descent Methods for Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multi-threaded parallel coordinate descent full configuration interaction algorithm (mCDFCI), for the electronic structure ground-state calculation in the configuration interaction framework. The FCI problem is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem, and tackled by a modified block coordinate descent method with a deterministic compression strategy. mCDFCI is designed to prioritize determinants based on their importance, with block updates enabling efficient parallelization on shared-memory, multi-core computing infrastructure. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm by computing an accurate benchmark energy for the chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs SV basis (48e, 42o), which explicitly includes $2.07 \times 10^9$ variational determinants. We also provide the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer under the cc-pVQZ basis set (14e, 110o). Benchmarks show up to $79.3\%$ parallel efficiency on 128 cores.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagation of adaptive sampling selected configuration interaction wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new time propagation method, time-dependent adaptive sampling configuration interaction (TD-ASCI), to describe the dynamics of a strongly correlated system. We employ the short iterative Lanczos (SIL) method as the time-integrator, which provides a unitary, norm-conserving, and stable long-time propagation scheme. We used the TD-ASCI method to evaluate the time-domain correlation functions of molecular systems. The accuracy of the correlation function was assessed by Fourier transforming (FT) into the frequency domain to compute the dipole-allowed absorption spectra. The FT has been carried out with a short-time signal of the correlation function to reduce the computation time, using an efficient alternative FT scheme based on the ESPRIT signal processing algorithm. We have applied the {TD-ASCI} method to prototypical strongly correlated molecular systems and compared the absorption spectra to spectra evaluated using the equation of motion coupled cluster (EOMCC) method with a truncation at single-doubles-triples (SDT) level.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</description>

      <title>MDRefine: a Python package for refining Molecular Dynamics trajectories with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in resolving the underlying conformational dynamics of molecular systems. However, their capability to correctly reproduce and predict dynamics in agreement with experiments is limited by the accuracy of the force-field model. This capability can be improved by refining the structural ensembles or the force-field parameters. Furthermore, discrepancies with experimental data can be due to imprecise forward models, namely, functions mapping simulated structures to experimental observables. Here, we introduce MDRefine, a Python package aimed at implementing the refinement of the ensemble, the force-field and/or the forward model by comparing MD-generated trajectories with experimental data. The software consists of several tools that can be employed separately from each other or combined together in different ways, providing a seamless interpolation between these three different types of refinement. We use some benchmark cases to show that the combined approach is superior to separately applied refinements.

      <title>Impact of dipole self-energy on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of matter to the quantized electromagnetic field of a plasmonic or optical cavity can be harnessed to modify and control chemical and physical properties of molecules. In optical cavities, a term known as the dipole self-energy (DSE) appears in the Hamiltonian to assure gauge invariance. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we introduce a method, which has its own merits and complements existing methods, to compute the DSE. Second, we study the impact of the DSE on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics in a realistic system. For that purpose, various matrix elements of the DSE are computed as functions of the nuclear coordinates and the dynamics of the system after laser excitation is investigated. The cavity is known to induce conical intersections between polaritons, which gives rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. The DSE is shown to slightly affect these light-induced conical intersections and, in particular, break their symmetry.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group in the discrete variable representation basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) using the discrete variable representation (DVR) basis set. One main advantage of using the local DVR basis sets is that the computations of one-electron integral and two-electron repulsion integrals are drastically simplified. For comparison, we further implemented DVR complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) using canonical molecular orbitals. These methods are applied to a one-dimensional pseudo-hydrogen chain under screened Coulomb potential. The DMRG ground state energy agrees with CASCI up to 0.1 mEh with a very small number of bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-stoichiometry in SnS: How it affects thin-film morphology and electrical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tin sulfide (SnS) has garnered much attention as a promising material for various applications, including solar cells and thermoelectric devices, owing to its favorable optical and electronic properties and the abundant and nontoxic nature of its constituent elements. Herein, we investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin films. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS films with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from 0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that non-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier density of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of intrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor side hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the self-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In addition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film morphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and porous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and dense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films for device applications. These findings underscore the importance of compositional control for tailoring the morphology and electrical behavior of SnS, paving the way for more efficient SnS-based devices.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene oxide) is an important polymer with many applications, e.g., as solid-state electrolyte in batteries. Its relaxation dynamics, characterizing its molecular and submolecular motions, which is relevant for many of these applications, was investigated numerous times, mostly employing dielectric spectroscopy. However, the various dynamic processes revealed by these studies were interpreted in conflicting ways and even their nomenclature in literature is highly inconsistent. Here we present the results of a detailed investigation of this polymer employing dielectric spectroscopy covering a relatively broad frequency and temperature range. We clearly detect four intrinsic relaxation processes. The slowest one most likely represents a so-called normal mode, reflecting global motions of the polymer chains, an interpretation that was not considered in previous works. The second process can be unequivocally identified with the segmental alpha relaxation, which governs glassy freezing and the glass transition. The third, only rarely detected process corresponds to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation of poly(ethylene oxide), widely overlooked in previous studies. The fourth and fastest process is unrelated to the supercooled and glassy state of this polymer and probably due to local, intramolecular motions.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Many-Body States with Neural-Network Exponential Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum many-body states on classical or quantum devices is a very challenging task that requires accounting for exponentially large Hilbert spaces. Although this complexity can be managed with exponential ans\"atze (such as in the coupled-cluster method), these approaches are often tailored to specific systems, which limits their universality. Recent work has shown that the contracted Schr\"odinger equation enables the construction of universal, formally exact exponential ans\"atze for quantum many-body physics. However, while the ansatz is capable of resolving arbitrary quantum systems, it still requires a full calculation of its parameters whenever the underlying Hamiltonian changes, even slightly. Here, inspired by recent progress in operator learning, we develop a surrogate neural network solver that generates the exponential ansatz parameters using the Hamiltonian parameters as inputs, eliminating the need for repetitive computations. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by training neural networks of several quantum many-body systems, including the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Classical Pre-optimization Approach for ADAPT-VQE: Maximizing the Potential of High-Performance Computing Resources to Improve Quantum Simulation of Chemical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ADAPT-VQE algorithm is a promising method for generating a compact ansatz based on derivatives of the underlying cost function, and it yields accurate predictions of electronic energies for molecules. In this work we report the implementation and performance of ADAPT-VQE with our recently developed sparse wavefunction circuit solver (SWCS) in terms of accuracy and efficiency for molecular systems with up to 52 spin-orbitals. The SWCS can be tuned to balance computational cost and accuracy, which extends the application of ADAPT-VQE for molecular electronic structure calculations to larger basis sets and larger number of qubits. Using this tunable feature of the SWCS, we propose an alternative optimization procedure for ADAPT-VQE to reduce the computational cost of the optimization. By pre-optimizing a quantum simulation with a parameterized ansatz generated with ADAPT-VQE/SWCS, we aim to utilize the power of classical high-performance computing in order to minimize the work required on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, which offers a promising path toward demonstrating quantum advantage for chemical applications.</description>

      <title>Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) towards air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with approximate M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil(decane)-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. A stable ionic double-layer distribution is observed near the air-water interface, while the distribution is different at oil-water interfaces, where hydronium tends to be repelled from the interface into the bulk water, whereas hydroxide, with an interfacial stabilization free energy of -0.6 kcal/mol, is enriched in the interfacial layer. Through simulations of oil droplets in water, we further reveal that the interfacial propensity of hydroxide ions is caused by the positive charge distribution of the oil-water interface contributed by hydrogens of the dangling OH bonds of interfacial water layer and the outmost layer decane molecules laying flat on the droplet. The present results may aid in understanding the acid-base nature of water interfaces with wide applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic Coherences in Molecules: The Projected Nuclear Quantum Momentum as a Hidden Agent</title>

Abstract: Electronic coherences are key to understanding and controlling photo-induced molecular transformations. We identify a crucial quantum-mechanical feature of electron-nuclear correlation, the projected nuclear quantum momenta, essential to capture the correct coherence behavior. In simulations, we show that, unlike traditional trajectory-based schemes, exact-factorization-based methods approximate these correlation terms, and correctly capture electronic coherences in a range of situations, including their spatial dependence, an important aspect that influences subsequent electron dynamics and that is becoming accessible in more experiments.</description>

      <title>The relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore theoretically whether a parity-violating/chiral light-matter interaction is required to capture all relevant aspects of chiral polaritonics or if a parity-conserving/achiral theory is sufficient (e.g. long-wavelength/dipole approximation). This question is non-trivial to answer, since achiral theories (Hamiltonians) still possess chiral solutions. To elucidate this fundamental theoretical question, a simple GaAs quantum ring model is coupled to an effective chiral mode of a single-handedness optical cavity in dipole approximation. The bare matter GaAs quantum ring possesses a non-degenerate ground state and a doubly degenerate first excited state. The chiral or achiral nature (superpositions) of the degenerate excited states remains undetermined for an isolated matter system. However, inside our parity-conserving description of a chiral cavity, we find that the dressed eigenstates automatically (ab-initio) attain chiral character and become energetically discriminated based on the handedness of the cavity. In contrast, the non-degenerate bare matter state (ground state) does not show an energetic discrimination inside a chiral cavity within dipole approximation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the handedness of the cavity can still be imprinted onto these states (e.g. angular momentum and chiral current densities). Overall, above findings highlight the relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics. In particular, because recent theoretical results for linearly polarized cavities indicate the formation of a frustrated and highly-degenerate electronic ground-state under collective strong coupling conditions, which, likewise, is expected to form in chiral polaritonics and thus could be prone to chiral symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles for open quantum systems: Dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipaton theory had been proposed as an exact and nonperturbative approach to deal with open quantum system dynamics, where the influence of Gaussian environment is characterized by statistical quasi-particles named as dissipatons. In this work, we revisit the dissipaton equation of motion theory and establish an equivalent dissipatons-embedded quantum master equation (DQME), which gives rise to dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles. As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and thus the physically supporting hybrid bath modes. Numerical demonstrations are carried out on the electron transfer model, exhibiting the transient statistical properties of the solvation coordinate.</description>
