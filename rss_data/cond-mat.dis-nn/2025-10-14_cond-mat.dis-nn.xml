      <title>Non-perturbatively slow spread of quantum correlations in non-resonant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a "prethermal many-body localized regime", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system.</description>

      <title>Train Stochastic Non Linear Coupled ODEs to Classify and Generate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general class of dynamical systems which can be trained to operate in classification and generation modes are introduced. A procedure is proposed to plant asymptotic stationary attractors of the deterministic model. Optimizing the dynamical system amounts to shaping the architecture of inter-nodes connection to steer the evolution towards the assigned equilibrium, as a function of the class to which the item - supplied as an initial condition - belongs to. Under the stochastic perspective, point attractors are turned into probability distributions, made analytically accessible via the linear noise approximation. The addition of noise proves beneficial to oppose adversarial attacks, a property that gets engraved into the trained adjacency matrix and therefore also inherited by the deterministic counterpart of the optimized stochastic model. By providing samples from the target distribution as an input to a feedforward neural network (or even to a dynamical model of the same typology of the adopted for classification purposes), yields a fully generative scheme. Conditional generation is also possible by merging classification and generation modalities. Automatic disentanglement of isolated key features is finally proven.</description>

      <title>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Bound on entanglement in neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational wavefunctions offer a practical route around the exponential complexity of many-body Hilbert spaces, but their expressive power is often sharply constrained. Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \leq c k\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Memory in Driven Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steadily shearing a non-Brownian suspension forms a memory of direction in its structure, while periodically shearing it forms a memory of amplitude. Our experiments show that these memories coexist and compete within a limited memory capacity. A specific oscillatory amplitude, previously associated with a critical transition, suppresses the directional (fore-aft) asymmetry. A similar picture is known in amorphous solids. We propose that these competing kinds of memory are a motif for non-equilibrium systems coupled to a scalar drive and are a basic example of interplay between memories.</description>

      <title>Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is predicted to enhance the critical temperature of disordered superconductors. Despite a huge body of theoretical work based on non-linear sigma models, experiments are lacking to understand correlated electrons in disordered potentials. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated groundstate. We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis can equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the underlying symmetries of disordered electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>
