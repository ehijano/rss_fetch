      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by [1] we describe the early post-merger of a binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the ejected baryonic matter fraction in the coalescence event forming a surrounding debris disk containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modelization using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques to replicate the gravitational waveforms obtained from simulations in the CoRe database for three selected equations of state for NS matter (DD2, BHBlp, SFHo). Later, we explore the impact of a dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force and obtain the waveforms and spectral properties originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our findings in light of the prospects of detectability of a non-vanishing fraction of dark matter arising in the waveforms and power spectral distribution in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Tests of General Relativity with Ground-Based Detectors and Pulsar-Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is focused on tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity with gravitational waves that are detectable by ground-based interferometers and pulsar-timing experiments. Einstein's theory has been greatly constrained in the quasi-linear, quasi-stationary regime, where gravity is weak and velocities are small. Gravitational waves are allowing us to probe a complimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the non-linear and dynamical \emph{extreme gravity regime}. Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact binaries coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of light and gravitational fields are large and dynamical. This review begins with the theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational-wave observables of modified gravity theories. The review continues with a brief description of the detectors, including both gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar-timing arrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that is applicable for such tests. The review then discusses gravitational-wave tests using compact binary systems, and ends with a description of the first gravitational wave observations by advanced LIGO, the stochastic gravitational wave background observations by pulsar timing arrays, and the tests that can be performed with them..</description>

      <title>$C^0$-inextendibility of the Kasner spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kasner spacetime is a cosmological model of an anisotropic expanding universe without matter and is an exact solution of the Einstein vacuum equations Ric(g) = 0. It is manifestly inextendible as a Lorentzian manifold with a twice differentiable metric. In this thesis we proof that it is even inextendible as a Lorentzian manifold with merely continuous metric, which is a stronger statement. We do so by adapting the proof of the $C^0$-inextendibility of the maximal analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime established by Jan Sbierski.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present solutions to the Einstein-Klein Gordon system representing boson stars in the slow rotation approximation. By considering slow rotation we are able to reduce the number of equations yielding a system of ordinary differential equations that is conveniently solved numerically without the need of expensive computational resources. We find sequences of solutions and describe some of their physical properties such as, total mass, angular momentum and compactness. We also consider the dynamics of particles (geodesics) in the resulting spacetime. A detailed comparison with fully rotating boson stars (non-linear treatment) is performed by showing the region of validity of the slow-rotation approximation.</description>

      <title>postmerger: A flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for non-precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasi-normal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian Process Regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on non-precessing, quasi-circular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Ringdown Surrogate Model for Non-Precessing Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly precise and robust waveform models are required as improvements in detector sensitivity enable us to test general relativity with more precision than ever before. In this work, we introduce a spin-aligned surrogate ringdown model. This ringdown surrogate, NRSur3dq8_RD, is built with numerical waveforms produced using Cauchy-characteristic evolution. In addition, these waveforms are in the superrest frame of the remnant black hole allowing us to do a correct analysis of the ringdown spectrum. The novel prediction of our surrogate model is complex-valued quasinormal mode (QNM) amplitudes, with median relative errors of $10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ over the parameter space. Like previous remnant surrogates, we also predict the remnant black hole's mass and spin. The QNM mode amplitude errors translate into median errors on ringdown waveforms of $10^{-4}$. The high accuracy and QNM mode content provided by our surrogate will enable high-precision ringdown analyses such as tests of general relativity. Our ringdown model is publicly available through the python package surfinBH.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of the absorption cross section of static regular black holes for electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report our study on the absorption cross section for the electromagnetic field due to static spherically symmetric regular black holes of two distinct categories: the Fan-Wang generic class and the Simpson-Visser class. Existing studies on these two categories have relied on the WKB method, which applies to the low-frequency regime. In our analysis, we have numerically evaluated the absorption cross section for the electromagnetic field across all frequency ranges. To compute the absorption cross section, we followed a gauge-invariant approach, which avoids the need for gauge fixing for the electromagnetic field, thereby simplifying the methodology further. To emphasize the usefulness of this gauge invariant approach we have performed the same analysis for Simpson-Visser class black holes, which is more general in terms of the structure of the metric. For both types of regular black holes, the influence of regularity parameters on the absorption cross section reveals fundamental properties of their spacetime and their interactions with the surrounding astrophysical environment. Moreover, certain similarities observed between the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and regular black holes of the Fan-Wang generic class indicate potential scenarios of correspondence between linear and nonlinear electrodynamics when coupled with gravity.</description>

      <title>A Class of Analytical Models for Black holes Surrounded by Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of analytic models for a dark matter halo surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy, with a variable inner radius $r_{\text{in}}$, at which the density profile of the dark matter halo vanishes. We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are satisfied in such models. In particular, we find that the three energy conditions are satisfied when $r_{\text{in}} &gt; 5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the black hole. These solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are particularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relativistic World of Electromagnetism on Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Interacting Models of Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the interacting models between the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field and the dark matter fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic background. A key feature of GB coupling models is the varying speed of gravitational waves (GWs). We utilize recent constraints on the GW speed and conduct our analysis in two primary scenarios: model-dependent and model-independent. In the model-dependent scenario, where determining the GW speed requires a specific GB coupling functional form, we choose an exponential GB coupling. We adopt a dynamical system analysis to obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters that describe different phases of the universe and produce a stable late-time accelerating solution following the GW constraint, and find that to satisfy all these constraints, fine-tuning of the free parameters involved in the models is often needed. In the model-independent scenario, the GW speed is fixed to one, and we construct the autonomous system to identify the late-time stable accelerating critical points. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian inference method using late-time observational data sets, including 31 data points from cosmic chronometer data (Hubble data) and 1701 data points from Pantheon+ and find that all the observational constraints can be satisfied without fine-tuning. In addition, we also utilize simulated binned Roman and LSST data to study the evolution of the universe in the model-independent scenario. We find that the model shows significant deviation at higher redshifts from $\Lambda$CDM and fits the current data much better than $\Lambda$CDM within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <title>Observed jet power and radiative efficiency of black hole candidates in Kerr + PFDM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we explore the electromagnetic energy emitted by astrophysical black holes within the Kerr+PFDM spacetime, a model encompassing rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter. Our investigation focuses on black holes within X-ray binary systems, namely GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, A0620-00, H1743-322, and GRS 1124-683. Our findings indicate that the Kerr+PFDM spacetime can account for the radiative efficiency of these sources as determined through the continuum fitting method (CFM). Additionally, employing the Blandford-Znajeck mechanism, we demonstrate the ability to replicate the observed jet power. By combining the outcomes of both analyses for the selected objects, we establish more rigorous constraints on the spacetime parameters. Notably, our results reveal that similar to the Kerr spacetime, the Kerr+PFDM spacetime cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell wormholes admitting conformal motions in spacetimes of embedding class one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the feasibility of thin-shell wormholes in spacetimes of embedding class one admitting a one-parameter group of conformal motions. It is shown that the surface energy density $\sigma$ is positive, while the surface pressure $\mathcal{P}$ is negative, resulting in $\sigma +\mathcal{P}&lt;0$, thereby signaling a violation of the null energy condition, a necessary condition for holding a wormhole open. For a Morris-Thorne wormhole, matter that violates the null energy condition is referred to as "exotic." For the thin-shell wormholes in this paper, however, the violation has a physical explanation since it is a direct consequence of the embedding theory in conjunction with the assumption of conformal symmetry. These properties avoid the need to hypothesize the existence of the highly problematical exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Improving Mimetic Gravity with Non-trivial Scalar Potential: Cosmology, Black Holes, Shadow and Photon Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not easy to treat the spacetime with horizon(s) in the standard mimetic gravity. The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830 (2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier constraint.
  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the cosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the scalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for the above theories are presented as specific examples from the general reconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history via the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two black hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are constructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black holes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius with the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is demonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation in Generalized Brans Dicke Theory: Compact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generation and properties of
  gravitational radiation within the framework of Generalized
  Brans-Dicke (GBD) theory, with a specific emphasis on its
  manifestation in compact binary systems. The primary focus of this study lies in the
  comprehensive exploration of gravitational radiation generated by
  compact binaries. The energy momentum tensor and the associated
  gravitational wave (GW) radiation power in GBD theory are
  investigated, elucidating the relationship between these
  fundamental concepts. Furthermore, detailed calculations are
  provided for the GW radiation power originating from both tensor
  fields and scalar fields. Based on our calculations, both scalar
  fields contribute to GW radiation by producing dipole radiation.
  We also study the period derivative of compact binaries in this
  theory. By comparing with the observational data of the orbital
  period derivative of the quasicircular white dwarf-neutron star
  binary PSR J1012+5307, we put bounds on the two parameters of the
  theory: the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_{0}$ and the
  mass of geometrical scalar field $m_f$, \textcolor{black}{resulting
  in a lower bound $\omega_{0}&gt;6.09723\times10^6$ for a massless BD
  scalar field and the geometrical field whose mass is smaller than
  $10^{-29} \text{GeV}$. The obtained bound on $\omega_0$ is two
  orders of magnitude stricter than those derived from solar system
  data.} Finally, we find the phase shift that GWs experience in the
  frequency domain during their propagation.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent gravity and covariant scale-setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental element of scale-dependent gravity is the scale-setting procedure. We present a new covariant expression to set the scale that arises when examining the field equations. Considering the renormalization group equations and imposing energy-momentum tensor conservation, we arrive at two models of running of the gravitational and cosmological constants. In the cosmological setting, we found that in one model the Big Bang singularity is avoided, while in the other the Hubble tension can be alleviated.

      <title>Non-commutativity in modified loop cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the pre-inflationary dynamics of the universe using a noncommutative extension of the mLQC-I framework. By incorporating a scalar field potential, we show that key features of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), such as the quantum bounce and the super-inflationary phase, are preserved. Numerical solutions to the modified Hamiltonian equations, with initial conditions set at the quantum bounce, reveal that the universe's early expansion rate is sensitive to the shape of the potential. For a chaotic potential, the inclusion of noncommutativity results in a faster expansion rate, whereas for the Starobinsky potential, the expansion rate decreases with increasing noncommutative parameter $\theta$. Additionally, higher values of $\theta$ lead to an increased time derivative of the Hubble parameter, causing a shorter yet more expansive super-inflationary phase. Over time, Hubble parameters for different values of $\theta$ converge. For the Starobinsky potential, the Hubble parameter consistently decreases with larger $\theta$, resulting in a prolonged super-inflationary stage. The study also addresses the validation of the Hamiltonian constraint during the evolutionary time.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of accelerating spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the exact values of the quasinormal frequencies for massless perturbations with spin $s\leq2$ moving in pure accelerating spacetime. We use two different methods to transfer the perturbation equations into the form of hypergeometric differential equations and obtain the same quasinormal frequencies. These purely imaginary spectra are shown to be independent of the spin of the perturbation and match those of the so-called acceleration modes of accelerating black holes after taking the Minkowski limit. This implies that the acceleration modes actually originate from the pure accelerating spacetime and the appearance of black holes would deform the spectra. In addition, we calculate the quasinormal frequencies of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and compare them with previous results to verify the validity of our method.</description>

      <title>Non-linear scattering of plane gravitational and electromagnetic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully non-linear, plane-symmetric exact solutions of the Einstein equations describing the scattering of gravitational and electromagnetic waves have existed for many years. For these closed-form solutions to be found, idealized wave profiles such as the Dirac delta and Heaviside theta functions must be assumed. Although pathological in that future curvature singularities generically occur, these exact solutions give useful insights into the non-linear features of the scattering process. Only a limited number of exact solutions exist and this leaves many other physically-motivated scattering situations without a non-linear description. The aim of this paper is to shed light on these unexplored cases. This is achieved through numerical solutions of the Friedrich-Nagy initial boundary value problem for the Einstein equations coupled to the source-free Maxwell equations in plane symmetry. Interesting non-linear scattering effects are presented for a variety of electromagnetic and gravitational wave profiles not currently described by an exact solution. Implications for electromagnetic wave observations are investigated through analyzing the time-delay and frequency shift imparted on the electromagnetic wave through the non-linear scattering with a gravitational wave of a given strain. Simple arguments supported by the numerical solutions suggest dramatic effects on the radiation may be observable.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasiresonance frequencies of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Kasner dynamics inside anisotropic black hole with vector hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the KG-constrained general disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although with great successes in explaining phenomena and natural behaviour involving the Universe or a part thereof, the General Theory of Relativity is far from a complete theory. There are plenty of avenues to investigate its extensions or generalisations that, in the future, could pave the way for a much deeper understanding and possibly solutions of current problems involving the Universe; e.g., dark matter, dark energy, fine-tuning, etc. Focusing on its extension within the framework of scalar tensor theory, we investigate the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action under the general disformal transformation coupled with set of triple KG constraints. The idea is that the general disformal transformation leads to an extremely complicated action necessitating a set of constraints to tame the resulting form. Motivated by previous studies on the invertibility and invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation, we identify three constraints that significantly simplifies the transformed Einstein-Hilbert action. In four spacetime dimensions, we find that the transformed action is a sum of the original action and a disformal contribution involving a six-term Lagrangian that includes the Ricci tensor coupled to a sum of derivatives of scalar fields and kinetic terms. In three spacetime dimensions, the disformal contribution becomes a five-term Lagrangian. Lastly, in two spacetime dimensions, the Einstein-Hilbert action is invariant under the constrained disformal transformation.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent, spherically symmetric background in Kaluza-Klein compactified Horndeski theory and the speed of gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the models recently derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski theory, where the resulting electromagnetic sector features non-trivial couplings to Horndeski scalar. In particular, this class of theories admits the electromagnetic waves propagating at non-unit speed, which in turn allows to relax the constraints on Horndeski theories following from multi-messenger speed test. In this work we prove that both gravitational wave and its electromagnetic counterpart propagate at the same, although non-unit, speed above an arbitrarily time-dependent, spherically symmetric background within the theories in question. Hence, we support the statement that several subclasses of Horndeski theories are not necessarily ruled out after the GW170817 event provided the photon-Galileon couplings are allowed. We also formulate the set stability conditions for an arbitraty solution within the discussed theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>Gas-rich "ultra-diffuse" galaxies are consistent with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and with Milgromian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some gas-rich "ultra-diffuse" galaxies (UDGs), which are extreme examples of low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies, have been reported to lack dark matter and to be offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). If confirmed, these UDGs would represent a serious challenge for both LCDM galaxy-formation models and Milgromian dynamics. Here I demonstrate that these conclusions are very dubious due to underestimated uncertainties on inclinations and/or distances. First, I show that UDGs are offset from the BTFR in the same way as usual face-on LSB dwarfs due to systematic biases at low inclinations. Next, I analyze the two UDGs with the best available rotation-curve data. The first UDG (AGC 242019) is ideally inclined for kinematic studies; MOND can fit the observed rotation curve with a distance of 12.5 +/- 0.6 Mpc, which is consistent with Virgocentric flow models. The second UDG (AGC 114905) is close to face-on, so not ideal for kinematic studies; MOND can fit the observed rotation curve with a distance of 68 +/- 13 Mpc and inclination of 15 +/- 2 degrees, which are consistent with existing data. In particular, I show that the disk inclination is more uncertain than previously estimated due to significant asymmetries (lopsidedness) in the stellar distribution. In conclusion, there is no strong evidence that gas-rich UDGs and gas-rich LSB dwarfs are distinct galaxy populations with different dynamical properties; instead, UDGs seem to be a subset of LSB dwarf galaxies biased toward face-on systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Extremal Black Holes and the UV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been noted that deformations of extremal AdS black holes in four and higher dimensions are generically non-smooth or singular on the horizon. Further, it was found that certain deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes are marginal, causing the nature of the horizon to be strongly sensitive to UV corrections -- in particular, Wilson coefficients associated with consistent UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. In this work, we extend the discussion of deformed horizons in the presence of UV corrections to extremal charged black holes in AdS where we find a tower of marginal perturbations for different black hole masses. We argue that the apparent UV sensitivity of marginal modes is, in fact, a feature of the UV theory which is correctly reproduced by the EFT, and illustrate this with explicit UV completions confirming the validity of the EFT. We demonstrate that the same holds for a scalar-Maxwell EFT with known UV completion. In the gravitational case, the sign of EFT corrections to marginal perturbations is generally connected with the signs implied by positivity bounds, with UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. We conjecture that this result is more generic, and use this to derive more general positivity bound motivated by the weak gravity conjecture, which we illustrate with further evidence.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of QFT in curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of nonrelativistic quantum physics was originally considered in the context of inertial frames. Here, we report on a more general framework that includes noninertial frames and arbitrarily strong gravitational fields. We derive from first principles the nonrelativistic limit of quantum fields in curved spacetime. Unique features and subtleties of the fully covariant theory in curved spacetime affect nonrelativistic quantum systems in accelerated frames when the acceleration is sufficiently high. This includes the frame dependent notion of particles, energies, vacuum states and nonrelativistic conditions. By using the algebraic approach to quantum field theory, we detail these effects in the noninertial nonrelativistic regime. The theoretical framework developed here gives predictions about the phenomenology of nonrelativistic quantum systems that are put in noninertial motion. As an application, we derive the realistic model of accelerated nonrelativistic atoms by using Dirac field theory in Rindler spacetime. We report on the experimental constraints for the indirect observation of the Unruh effect by means of atomic detectors via hyperfine structure. Then, we address the problem of localization of quantum states and observables in inertial and accelerated frames. We show how the Born probabilistic notion emerges in both cases as a consequence of the respective nonrelativistic limit. As a result, we find that nonrelativistic states can be described in terms of wave functions that quantify the probability to find particles in each space position. Also, we report on nonlocal effects that originate from the frame dependent nature of vacuum states and nonrelativistic conditions in the quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define compactness of a gravitational lens as the scaled closest distance of approach (i.e., $r_0/M$) of the null geodesic giving rise to an image. We model forty supermassive dark objects as Schwarzschild lenses and compute compactness of lenses (determined by the formation of the first order relativistic image). We then obtain a novel formula for the compactness of a lens as a function of mass to the distance ratio ($M/D_d$) and the ratio of lens-source to the observer-source distances ($D_{ds}/D_s$). This formula yields a very important result: Just an observation of a relativistic image would give an incredibly accurate upper bound to the physical compactness (the ratio of the radius to mass) of the lens without having any knowledge of mass of the lens, angular source position, and observer-source and lens-source distances. Similarly, we show that the observation of the second order relativistic image would give a lower value of upper bound to the physical compactness. These results, though obtained for supermassive dark objects at galactic centers, are valid for any object compact enough to give rise to relativistic images.</description>

      <title>Importance of eccentricities in parameter estimation of compact binary inspirals with decihertz gravitational-wave detectors</title>

Abstract: During its inspiral stage, a binary black hole (BBH) produces characteristic gravitational wave (GW) signals. The waveform of the GW signals can be described by the physical parameters of BBH, such as the masses of the black holes and the orbital eccentricity. Precise and accurate estimation of these parameters is crucial for GW astrophysics. In the aspect of precision, decihertz GW detectors are promising proposals, as they are anticipated to allow us to obtain highly precise parameter estimations for stellar-mass BBHs. However, the high-precision parameter estimation requires accurate GW waveform modeling. Otherwise, systematic errors can arise in estimated parameters. We emphasize the importance of considering the orbital eccentricity in constructing an accurate GW waveform model. B-DECIGO and MAGIS are used as benchmarks for decihertz GW detectors. We examine the significance of systematic error for a population of stellar-mass BBH inspirals. We found that the quasicircular GW waveform model exhibits significant systematic errors for BBH with a very small eccentricity $\sim 10^{-4}$ at GW frequency $0.1\, \text{Hz}$. The modeling accuracy can be substantially enhanced by incorporating the leading-order correction to GW phase evolution associated with eccentricity smaller than 0.01. The higher-order post-Newtonian corrections induced by eccentricity should be important only for eccentricity larger than 0.01.</description>

Abstract: In the cosmological settings, Quantum Gravity effects are typically understood to be limited towards very early phase of the universe, namely in the pre-inflationary era, with limited signatures spilling over into the succeeding inflationary era which gradually fade away as the universe transits into the subsequent radiation and matter driven expansion. In general scenarios as well, the imprints of possible quantum character of gravitons are typically so feeble that they are expected to remain buried under overwhelming noise from other stronger processes. In this work, we demonstrate that quantized gravitational perturbations cause strong observable effects in cosmological settings post the Last Scattering Surface (LSS) more prominently than any other classical or quantum processes. This counter-intuitive effect is facilitated by the fact that the quantum correlators of the gravitons {\it grow divergently large in the matter dominated era} unlike any other background fields leading to an abrupt rise in the processes mediated by correlators of quantum gravitons, which otherwise is way too feeble. The transitions between spherical harmonics states of a hydrogen atom guided by gravitons in a particular phase of the late time era of the universe, provides an example of such a process. Thus the newly formed atoms post LSS are expected to get excited from the vacuum fluctuations of gravitons quite efficiently in this era and also get de-excited to convert the vacuum fluctuations to an additional channel of energy influx into the evolution history. Such unavoidable processes provide an avenue of quantum graviton mediated process becoming important in the late time era, which has many interesting implications.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Boltzmann system for massless particles in the Bianchi I space-time with scattering cross-sections in a certain range of soft potentials. We assume that the space-time has an initial conformal gauge singularity and show that the initial value problem is well posed with data given at the singularity. This is understood by considering conformally rescaled equations. The Einstein equations become a system of singular ordinary differential equations, for which we establish an existence theorem which requires several differentiability and eigenvalue conditions on the coefficient functions together with the Fuchsian conditions. The Boltzmann equation is regularized by a suitable choice of time coordinate, but still has singularities in momentum variables. This is resolved by considering singular weights, and the existence is obtained by exploiting singular moment estimates.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Approach to Detecting Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has opened up new avenues for exploring and understanding some of the fundamental principles of the universe. The optimal method for detecting modelled gravitational-wave events involves template-based matched filtering and performing a multi-detector coincidence search in the resulting signal-to-noise ratio time series. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have led to a flurry of research into using these techniques to replace matched filtering searches and for efficient and robust parameter estimation of the gravitational wave sources. This paper presents a feasibility study for a novel approach to detecting binary black hole gravitational wave signals, which utilizes deep learning techniques on the signal-to-noise ratio time series produced from matched filtering. We show that a deep-learning search can efficiently detect binary black hole gravitational waves from the signal-to-noise ratio time series in simulated Gaussian noise with simulated transient glitches. Furthermore, our search method can outperform a maximum SNR-based matched filtering search on simulated data of the Hanford and Livingston LIGO detectors in the presence of glitches. We further demonstrate that our approach can improve the detection sensitivity for binary black hole mergers at lower masses, relative to a baseline sensitivity of existing search pipelines and deep learning approaches. Lastly, since we are building upon the foundations of a matched filtering search pipeline, we can extract estimates for the signal-to-noise ratio and detector frame chirp mass of a gravitational wave event with similar accuracy as existing pipelines.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological tensor perturbation equation with generalized holonomy corrections is derived in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. This results in a generalized dispersion relation for gravitational waves, encompassing holonomy corrections. Furthermore, we conduct an examination of the constraint algebra concerning vector modes with generalized holonomy corrections. The requirement of anomaly cancellation for vector modes imposes constraints on the possible functional forms of the generalized holonomy corrections. What's more, we estimate the theoretical value of the effective graviton mass and discuss the potential detectability of this effective mass in future observations.</description>

      <title>Scalar field inflation driven by a modification of the Heisenberg algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modifications induced on scalar field inflation produced by considering a general modification of the Heisenberg algebra. We proceed by modifying the Poisson brackets on the classical theory whenever the corresponding quantum commutator is modified. We do not restrict ourselves to a specific form for such modification, instead we constrain the functions involved by the cosmological behaviour of interest. We present whenever possible the way in which inflation can be realized approximately via three slow roll Hubble parameters that depend on the standard slow roll parameters in a very different form than in the usual case and that can be less restrictive. Furthermore we find a general analytical solution describing an expanding universe with constant Hubble parameter that generalizes the standard cosmological constant case by restricting the form of the modification of the Heisenberg algebra. It is found that even if such modification can be neglected in some limit and the cosmological constant is set to zero in that limit, the exponential expansion is present when the modification is important. Thus an appropriate modification of the Heisenberg algebra is sufficient to produce an exponentially expanding universe without the need of any other source.</description>

      <title>Extracting linear and nonlinear quasinormal modes from black hole merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Light in the Gravitational lensing of Supermassive Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>

Abstract: The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work presents a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light in gravitational lenisng of central supermassive black holes. The enhancing effect becomes more pronounced with a small dark matter halo scale and an increasing dark matter halo mass.

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart &amp; Gong and developed by Auclair &amp; Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum, including its amplitude, spectral indices, their running and running of their running, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectrum of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation, without a field redefinition. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_\ast$. Surprisingly we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_\ast = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation and a prediction of a negative running $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=-\frac{1}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2+\ldots$ of the scalar tilt. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this paper, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Klein-Gordon equation in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole background, which is the charged rotating axially symmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory of gravity. The black hole incorporates electric, magnetic, dilatonic and axionic charges and is constructed in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We begin our investigations with the construction of the scalar field's governing equation, i.e., the covariant Klein-Gordon equation. With the help of the ansatz of separation of variables, we successfully separate the polar part, and find the exact solution in terms of Spheroidal Harmonics, while the radial exact solution is obtained in terms of the Confluent Heun function. The quantization of the quasibound state is done by applying the polynomial condition of the Confluent Heun function that gives rise to discrete complex-valued energy levels for massive scalar fields. The real part is the scalar field relativistic quantized energy, while the imaginary part represents the quasibound states's decay. We present all of the sixteen possible exact energy solutions for both massive and massless scalars. We also present the investigation the Hawking radiation of the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole's apparent horizon, via the Sigurd-Sannan method by making use of the obtained exact scalar wave functions. The radiation distribution function, and the Hawking temperature are successfully obtained.</description>

Abstract: In the Emergent scenario, the Universe should evolve from a non-singular state replacing the typical singularity of General Relativity, for any initial condition. For the scalar field model in [1] we show that only a set of measure zero of trajectories leads to emergence, either from a static state (an Einstein model), or from a de Sitter state.
  Assuming a scenario based on CDM interacting with a Dark Energy fluid, we show that in general flat and open models expand from a non-singular unstable de Sitter state at high energies; for some closed models this state is a transition phase with a bounce, other closed models are cyclic. A subset of these models are qualitatively in agreement with the observable Universe, accelerating at high energies, going through a matter-dominated decelerated era, then accelerating toward a de Sitter phase.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Shadow, ISCO, Quasinormal modes, Hawking spectrum, Weak Gravitational lensing, and parameter estimation of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider \s black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-$(1,4,0)$ type dark matter halo (DDM) with two additional parameters - core radius $r_s$ and core density $\rs$ apart from mass $M$. We analyze the event horizon, photon orbits, and ISCO around DDM BHs and emphasize the impact of DDM parameters on them. Our study reveals that the presence of dark matter (DM) favourably impacts the radii of photon orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and the event horizon. We find the expressions for specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles in time-like geodesics around DDM BH and investigate their dependence on DDM parameters. We display BH shadows for various values of core density and radius that reveal larger shadows cast by a \s BH surrounded by DDM (SDDM) than a \s BH in vacuum (SV). We then move on to study quasinormal modes (QNMs) with the help of the $6th$ order WKB method, the greybody factor using the semi-analytic bounds method, and the Hawking spectrum for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Core density and radius are found to have a significant impact on QNMs. Since QNMs for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations differ significantly, we can differentiate the two based on QNM observation. The greybody factor increases with core density and radius, whereas, the power emitted as Hawking radiation is adversely impacted by the presence of DM. We then study the weak gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and obtain the deflection angle with higher-order correction terms. Here, we see the deflection angle gets enhanced due to DM. Finally, we use bounds on the deviation from \s, $\delta$, reported by EHT for $M87^*$, Keck, and VLTI observatories for $Sgr A^*$ to gauge the viability of our model. Our model is found to be concordant with observations. This leads to the possibility of our galactic center being surrounded by DDM.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a Renormalization Group Improved Rotating Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotically safe gravity. The rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, is generated by using the generalized Newman-Janis algorithm. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as chi, with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter xi which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling chi and its connection with the quantum parameter xi are determined by the running of the Newton coupling G(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet non-gaussian fixed point of the asymptotic safety theory for quantum gravity. Varying both the spin parameter a/M and the quantum parameter xi, we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the morphology of the shadow cast by rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter xi, we confront our results with the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs M87 and Sgr A. We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved rotating BH.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics preserves invariant with respect to the choice of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics in Refs. [1,2] and Refs. [3,4] exhibits identical behavior near the transition surface,therefore in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed in Refs. [1,2] may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have outlined the development of an autonomous dynamical system within a general scalar-tensor gravity framework. This framework encompasses the overall structure of the non-minimally coupled scalar field functions for both the torsion scalar ($T$) and the boundary term ($B$). We have examined three well-motivated forms of potential functions and constrained the model parameters through dynamical system analysis. This analysis has played a crucial role in identifying cosmologically viable models. We have analysed the behaviour of dynamical parameters such as equation-of-state parameters for dark energy and the total, as well as all the standard density parameters for radiation, matter, and dark energy to assess their compatibility with current observational data. The phase space diagrams are presented to support the stability conditions of the corresponding critical points. The Universe is apparent in its late-time cosmic acceleration phase via the dark energy-dominated critical points. Additionally, we compare our findings with the most prevailing $\Lambda$CDM model. The outcomes are further inspected using the cosmological data sets of Supernovae Ia and the Hubble rate H(z).</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames for Lorentz Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their first introduction, Quantum Reference Frame (QRF) transformations have been extensively discussed, generalising the covariance of physical laws to the quantum domain. Despite important progress, a formulation of QRF transformations for Lorentz symmetry is still lacking. The present work aims to fill this gap. We first introduce a reformulation of relativistic quantum mechanics independent of any notion of preferred temporal slicing. Based on this, we define transformations that switch between the perspectives of different relativistic QRFs. We introduce a notion of ''quantum Lorentz transformations'' and ''superposition of Lorentz boosts'', acting on the external degrees of freedom of a quantum particle. We analyse two effects, superposition of time dilations and superposition of length contractions, that arise only if the reference frames exhibit both relativistic and quantum-mechanical features. Finally, we discuss how the effects could be observed by measuring the wave-packet extensions from relativistic QRFs.</description>

      <title>Prediction of non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the lightest neutrino mass revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the constraint of the non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the three-dimensional vacua obtained from the compactification of the Standard Model coupled to Einstein gravity on a circle where the three-dimensional components of the four-dimensional metric are general functions of both non-compact and compact coordinates. From studying the wavefunction profile of the three-dimensional metric in the compactified dimension, we find that the radius of the compactified dimension must be quantized. Consequently, the three-dimensional vacua are constrained by not only the non-SUSY AdS conjecture but also the quantization rule of the circle radius, leading to both upper and lower bounds for the mass of the lightest neutrino as $\sqrt{2}\leq m_\nu/\sqrt{\Lambda_4}&lt;\sqrt{3}$ where $\Lambda_4\simeq5.06\times10^{-84}$ GeV$^2$ is the observed cosmological constant. This means that the lightest neutrino should have a mass around $10^{-32}$ eV or it would be approximately massless. With this prediction, we reconstruct the light neutrino mass matrix that is fixed by the neutrino oscillation data and in terms of three new mixing angles and six new phases for both the normal ordering and inverted ordering. In the situation that the light neutrino mass matrix is Hermitian, we calculate its numerical value in the $3\sigma$ range.</description>

      <title>Loop correction and resummation of vertex functions for a self interacting scalar field in the de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a massless and minimally coupled self interacting quantum scalar field theory in the inflationary de Sitter background of dimension four. The self interaction potential is taken to be either quartic, $\lambda \phi^4/4!$, or quartic plus cubic, $\lambda \phi^4/4!+\beta \phi^3/3!$ ($\lambda \,{\ensuremath &gt;}\,0$). We compute the four and three point vertex functions up to two loop. The purely local or partly local part of these renormalised loop corrected vertex functions grow unboundedly after sufficient number of de Sitter $e$-foldings, due to the appearances of secular logarithms. We focus on the purely local part of the vertex functions and attempt a resummation of them in terms of the dynamically generated mass of the scalar field at late times. Such local logarithms have sub-leading powers compared to the non-local leading ones which can be resummed via the stochastic formalism. The variation of these vertex functions are investigated with respect to the tree level couplings numerically. Since neither the secular effect, nor the dynamical generation of field mass is possible in the Minkowski spacetime, the above phenomenon has no flat spacetime analogue. We have also compared our result with the ones that could be found via the recently proposed renormalisation group techniques. All these results suggest that at late times the value of the non-perturbative vertex function should be less than the tree level coupling.</description>

Abstract: We show that the non-supersymmetric AdS instability conjecture can point to how quantum gravity removes the initial Big Bang singularity, leading to a potential resolution for the past-incomplete inflationary universe. From the constraints on the dynamics of the universe realized as the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble mediating the decay of the non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum, we find the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical scale factor $a_c$ for which the universe exists. These critical quantities are all finite and determined in terms of the parameters specifying the stringy 10D AdS vacuum solutions. Additionally, we derive the prediction of quantum gravity for $T_c$ and $a_c$ relying on the inflationary observations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inside a black hole before the Page time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases due to internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole coupled with its radiation and the evolution of the global thermofield double (TFD) state. For small black holes, the reflected entropy between the bipartition exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. Similarly, the mutual information between the bipartition displays a ramp-slop-stabilizing behavior. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global TFD state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The R\'enyi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained picture of the entanglement dynamics inside black holes before their Page time.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for studying small-scale primordial perturbations and their cosmological implications. The framework uses a deep reinforcement learning to generate scalar power spectrum profiles that are consistent with current observational constraints. The framework is shown to predict the abundance of primordial black holes and the production of secondary induced gravitational waves. We demonstrate that the set up under consideration is capable of generating predictions that are beyond the traditional model-based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16356v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

Abstract: The present work delves into examining the thermodynamic properties of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newmann-AdS black hole, employing the recently proposed framework of restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). This approach introduces a novel set of paired thermodynamic variables: the central charge $C$ of the corresponding dual conformal field theory (CFT) and the chemical potential $\mu$. Through simple analysis, we establish fundamental relationships such as the Euler relation, Gibbs-Duhem relation, and the zeroth order homogeneity of intensive variables. Employing numerical techniques, we explore the thermodynamic processes between these conjugate variables. Our investigation reveals the first-order and second-order phase transitions across various macroscopic processes. Despite the absence of complete analytical expressions, our findings unveil striking similarities in behavior between RN-AdS and Kerr-AdS, underscoring the presence of underlying universality within the RPST formalism.</description>

Abstract: We continue the series of articles on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to unveil the basic phase structure of tensorial field theories which are characterized by combinatorially non-local interactions. Among others, this class covers tensor field theories (TFT) which lead to a new class of conformal field theories highly relevant for investigations on the AdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, it also encompasses models within the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Crucially, in the infrared we find that the effective mass of the modes relevant for the critical behavior vanishes not only at criticality but also throughout the entire phase of non-vanishing vacuum expectation value due to the non-locality of the interactions. As a consequence, one encounters there the emergence of scale invariance on configuration space which is potentially enhanced to conformal invariance thereon.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

      <title>Unearthing the intersections: positivity bounds, weak gravity conjecture, and asymptotic safety landscapes from photon-graviton flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Holographic stress tensor correlators on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Brane Profiles of Non-Supersymmetric Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also provide some hints on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>Influences of modified Chaplygin dark fluid around a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCG-AdSBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCG-AdSBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCG-AdSBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCG-AdSBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry of 2D Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$ (or Minkowski plane) is similar but fundamentally different from the more familiar Euclidean plane geometry. This note gives an elementary discussion on some basic properties of a triangle on the Minkowski plane. In particular, we show that the theorem of Feuerbach also holds and a use of the incenter/excenters is pointed out.</description>
