      <title>The thermal representation of conformal ladder integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the details of a recently discovered representation of conformal four-point ladder integrals as thermal one-point functions in scalar field theories. We show that the conformal ladder integrals can be constructed from the partition function of two harmonic oscillators twisted by an imaginary chemical potential and that for any even dimension $D$ and any loop order $L$ they satisfy a familiar second order differential equation. In our representation, thermal one-point functions of higher-spin operators correspond to linear combinations of multi-loop ladder graphs in $D=2$ and $D=4$ dimensions. Moreover, we give a simple derivation for the all-loop resummation of conformal ladder integrals for arbitrary $D$. We conclude by highlighting possible connections between our work and recent developments in the thermal bootstrap, multiloop calculations, integrability, AdS/CFT and string theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, anomalies, and dualities of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the global symmetry structure of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models with Wess-Zumino term. When the target space has a compact isometry without fixed points, the theory has a pair of (group-like) global symmetries and many such theories also have non-invertible symmetries. We describe how the topology of the target space and Wess-Zumino term determine whether the group-like symmetries are continuous or discrete, and study their pure and mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We also revisit the construction of the non-invertible symmetries, which are associated with possible self-dualities under discrete gauging, and show how the global symmetry structure is left invariant by this gauging.</description>

      <title>Localised $\mathrm{AdS}_3\times \mathrm{S}^3\times \mathbb{T}^4$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes in type IIB supergravity, with $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(3) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry, localised on the $\mathrm{S}^3$ and translationally invariant along the torus. These solutions, with horizons whose spatial cross sections have $\mathrm{S}^4 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ topology, dominate the microcanonical ensemble at low energies. At higher energies, a first-order phase transition occurs to $\mathrm{BTZ} \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes $-$ possessing $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(4) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry and $\mathrm{S}^1 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ horizon topology. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition reflects the spontaneous breaking of the $SO(4)$ R-symmetry of the D1-D5 CFT$_2$ to $SO(3)$. We also compute the expectation value of the scalar operator with lowest conformal dimension in the low-energy phase. Our $SO(3)$-localised black holes $-$ together with the $U(1)^2$-localised solutions of [1] $-$ point to a rich landscape of novel black holes that may approach the $\mathrm{CFT}_2$ sparseness bootstrap condition, and shed light on how macroscopic entanglement in thermal phases encodes microscopic structure via internal directions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational currents and charges from conformal Killing-Yano tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a set of higher-form conserved currents on spacetimes admitting conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We find relations between these currents that allow the charge given by integrating one of these currents over a region to be re-expressed as an integral of a covariant quantity over the boundary. In many cases, only a non-covariant form of the boundary integral was previously known. For a special class of these currents the conservation does not rely on field equations, so they give conserved topological charges in any gravitational theory. We discuss the relation of our currents to the Komar current and derive several new properties of conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We study a number of applications of our construction to charges of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and D-brane solutions of type II supergravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to Symmetron Fifth-Force Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear scalar-tensor theories of gravity have been considered as candidates for dark matter and dark energy. Often, they possess screening mechanisms which allow the fifth force mediated by the additional scalar degree(s) of freedom to evade detection from local experiments. Their classical behaviour is well studied, but their quantum nature is relatively unexplored. We outline a Green's function method for obtaining the leading-order quantum corrections to the classical symmetron field profile in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric extended source. For parameters that experiments had previously ruled out, our calculations indicate that the symmetron force may be weaker than the classical field suggests.</description>

      <title>Green's functions under magnetic effects in a nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the Bose and Dirac field propagators in a four-dimensional Euclidean space under a magnetic external field by using a hybrid version of the Ritus and Schwinger methods. We get both propagators explicitly in the coordinate and momentum domains without dimensional reduction. Through gauge transformations, we eliminate the translation non-invariant part of the propagators. Also, the Matsubara frequencies of the fields are obtained in a toroidal topology. The approach we consider in this paper has the advantage of taking into account thermal and finite-volume effects with several kinds of boundary conditions, in addition to considering all Landau levels simultaneously, in an analytical and tractable way.</description>

      <title>Associativity of celestial OPE, higher spins and self-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight and clarify the connection between several ideas and self-dual theories: (a) the operator product expansion (OPE) associativity in celestial conformal field theory (CCFT); (b) the vanishing of tree-level amplitudes; (c) the Jacobi identity for the "gauge" algebra; (d) the light-cone holomorphic constraints. Naturally, (b), (c), or (d) are closely related to self-duality. In particular, the recently classified arXiv:2505.12839 chiral higher-spin theories with one- and two-derivative interactions (i.e. with gauge and gravitational interactions, which are extensions of self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity) also satisfy the OPE associativity constraint. We discuss the OPE associativity constraint and the holomorphic constraint for the most general class of cubic vertices.</description>

      <title>Yang--Mills $\beta$ function in the gradient flow exact renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group of gauge theory that is aimed to preserve gauge symmetry as manifestly as possible. From an integral representation of the Wilson action in GFERG equation for the Yang--Mills theory, we explicitly compute the one-loop renormalization group functions that reproduce correct coefficients. From the correspondence with the gradient flow formalism by L\"uscher and Weisz, we argue that GFERG reproduces the conventional renormalization group functions in all orders of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in Phys. Rev. D 100, 045024 (2019), we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In this method, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. We then extend the analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a meticulous analysis of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The holographic entanglement pattern of BTZ planar black hole from a thread perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holographic quantum entanglement structure in the finite-temperature CFT state/planar BTZ black hole correspondence from the perspective of entanglement threads. Unlike previous studies based on bit threads, these entanglement threads provide a more detailed characterization of the contribution sources to the von Neumann entropy of boundary subregions, in particular by quantitatively deriving the flux function of entanglement threads that traverse the wormhole horizon and connect the two asymptotic boundaries. Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary. We also discuss the close connections of this work with concepts such as bit threads and partial entanglement entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermal Correlators and Black Holes: From Infinity to Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states in relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical setup for investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states is presented for a scalar massive Quantum Field Theory ($1+1$)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. These states are constructed using smeared Weyl operators compactly supported in two diamond regions belonging to the right Rindler wedge. Using this setup, we verified the known properties of the relative entropy, namely: positivity, increase with the size of the spacetime regions considered, decrease with the increase of the mass parameter, a linear increase with respect to the spatial distance between the two diamond regions is also observed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an example of summation of non-logarithmic singularities of a specific type in a two-dimensional non-linear sigma model. As a result of the study, we obtained an explicit formula, which, upon formal expansion in terms of the coupling constant, reproduces a particular part of the quantum action. Additionally, the paper introduces a new auxiliary function and discusses some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tension Strings with Target Scale Symmetry producing DE, DM and why 4D?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17333v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modified measure formulation string or branes the tension appear as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . Furthermore in the presence of an additional background scalar field that couples to the strings and locally changes the tension, the tension field really dynamical and the theory has an intrinsic target space scale symmetry. When many types of strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two types of strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings. Each of these metrics have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equations determine the tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically does not satisfy Einsteins equation . We review a case where two string dependent metrics considered here are flat space in Minkowski space and Minkowski space after a special conformal transformation and leads to a well defined brane world solution. We review how the model avoid swampland constraints making treatments for Dark energy and inflation more realistic and how strings with a different tension appear as Dark Matter to us. Since the Dark strings and since the visible strings share the space time, including the same compactification, and since the compactification determines the particle content, we argue that the dark strings lead to Dark copies of the standard model. An argument that many copies will lead to 4D effective spacetime as a consequence of a target space scale symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>Phantom BTZ Black Holes: Thermal Properties Under Perturbative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes by incorporating leading-order perturbative corrections arising from small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium. Starting from the phantom BTZ black holes review, we describe a modified action in three-dimensional spacetime that includes coupling with a Maxwell or phantom field. The analysis derives the corresponding field equations and obtains exact solutions for the metric and thermodynamic quantities. The corrected entropy is computed using the steepest descent method. It is expressed in terms of the leading-order entropy and Hawking temperature. Standard thermodynamic relations yield the corrected mass, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy. These corrections reveal significant deviations from classical results, particularly in the small black hole regime where statistical effects become prominent. Graphical analysis shows that the corrected entropy becomes negative for sufficiently small black holes, indicating potential limitations in thermodynamic stability under perturbative corrections. Furthermore, the influence of thermal fluctuations proves substantial for the small black holes and negligible for larger black holes. In this work, we have also calculated critical points and critical compressibility factor ($Z_{c}$) of the phantom BTZ black hole, treating it as a Van der Waals fluid. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how statistical fluctuations modify the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes. It underscores the necessity of including such corrections in realistic models of black hole thermodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact infrared scaling behavior of Randers-Finsler scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling behavior of Randers-Finsler massless scalar field theories in the infrared regime. For that, we compute analytically the radiative corrections to the corresponding anomalous dimensions, related to the critical exponents of the theory, first up to next-to-leading loop order and later for all-loop levels. We consider the effect of the Randers-Finsler space-time properties on the critical exponents by considering the parameter characterizing those space-times in its exact form. We employ field-theoretic renormalization group and $\epsilon$-expansion techniques at dimensions $d = 4 - \epsilon$ through three distinct and independent methods. At the end, we furnish the physical interpretation of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational analog of the Non-Abelian T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-abelian T duality (NATD) is a symmetry of the worldsheet action that allows one to generate new solutions of string theory by performing algebraic transformations of known geometries. Applications of such transformations to spheres have been especially fruitful in the past, but the results did not reduce to the abelian transformation in the decompactification limit unless the dimension of sphere was equal to three. We propose a unique counterpart of NATD in classical gravity that reproduces the correct decompactification limit for all spheres $S^n$ but generates an n-form field strength and therefore cannot be naturally embedded in a worldsheet theory of NS-NS fields unless n=3. We also propose a non-abelian version of the TsT transformation which produces solutions of type II supergravity describing continuous deformations of geometries with $S^n\times S^n$ and $S^n\times T^n$ factors.</description>

      <title>The holographic dual of the GHZ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current holographic research mostly focuses on a subset of quantum systems with a classical gravity dual. Although the precise boundary of this subset remains unknown, certain constraints are recognized; for instance, holographic entropies obey inequalities that are violated by general quantum states such as the GHZ states. This paper, however, presents a gravity dual for GHZ states -- a non-ordinary geometry termed the booklet wormhole. We demonstrate an exact match for all entropy properties with the GHZ state, as well as the identity of the Euclidean partition functions for both systems. The booklet wormhole circumvents the conventional holographic entropy inequalities because different topologies are inevitably included in the gravitational path integral, even in the large-$N$ limit. This provides the first explicit holographic duality with a non-perturbative quantum effect. Remarkably, the construction is simple and maximally entangled, making it ideal for gedanken experiments.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric BMS$_4$ Algebras Revisited: Electric/Magnetic Superalgebras and Free Field Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic classification of supersymmetric extensions of the BMS$_4$ algebra and their realizations in free field theories. By requiring that supercharges admit finite-dimensional subsectors, we identify ten distinct electric super BMS$_4$ algebras and six magnetic ones. The electric case is characterized by supercharge anticommutators closing on supertranslations, while the magnetic case necessarily involves superrotations. To realize these algebras in free field theories, we follow a constructive procedure: first identify the modes bilinears of which generate the symmetry algebra, then determine the fields with appropriate transformation properties under the BMS$_4$ algebra, and finally construct consistent theories whose equations of motion admit the desired supersymmetry. Notably, $R$-symmetry with nonvanishing spin is essential for the Type II-II, Type I-II, and Type II-I magnetic super BMS$_4$ algebras, shedding new light on spacetime structure of string theory for flat holography. Moreover, in the Type I-I theory, $R$-symmetry relates electric and magnetic scalars, indicating their equal significance. In addition, $R$-symmetry maps the electric scalar to a spin-$1$ field and vice versa, offering a novel perspective on supersymmetric extensions of soft theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homotopy Lie or $L_{\infty}$ algebra encoding Yang-Mills theory is the tensor product of a color Lie algebra with the kinematic $C_{\infty}$ algebra. We derive this $C_{\infty}$ algebra, via homotopy transfer, from a strict operator algebra of a worldline theory, realized as an associative star product algebra. This gives a homotopy transfer interpretation to worldline vertex operators introduced in previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18171v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy by the quadratic curvature terms for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.</description>

      <title>Stable models in lower dimensions within the quadratic form of the non-metricity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of the quadratic form of the symmetric teleparallel theory, known as $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By employing a spherically symmetric ansatz and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of the quadratic correction term in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of the solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to general relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics relative to general relativity.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Solution in Kalb-Ramond Gravity with Quintessence Field: From Geodesic Dynamics to Thermal Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of black hole solutions in Kalb-Ramond gravity embedded with quintessence fields. Our study examines how combined effects of Lorentz violation through the Kalb-Ramond field parameter $\eta$ and exotic matter contributions via quintessence parameters $(\mathrm{C}, w)$ systematically modify spacetime geometry, particle dynamics, and observational signatures compared to standard Schwarzschild black holes. The analysis encompasses geodesic motion for both photons and massive particles, revealing substantial modifications to effective potentials, photon sphere characteristics, and innermost stable circular orbit properties. We derive analytical expressions for black hole shadow radii across different quintessence states, demonstrating systematic parameter dependencies enabling observational discrimination between theoretical frameworks. Our perturbation analysis of scalar and electromagnetic fields shows how Lorentz violation and quintessence effects alter wave propagation and stability properties. Using Gauss-Bonnet theorem methodology, we calculate gravitational lensing deflection angles incorporating both modified gravity and exotic matter contributions. The thermodynamic investigation reveals complex phase structures with modified Hawking temperature evolution, Gibbs free energy characteristics, and specific heat capacity behavior significantly deviating from general relativity predictions. Lorentz violation amplifies gravitational effects, whereas quintessence exerts counteractive forces, generating complex parameter spaces allowing precise manipulation of observable quantiti</description>

      <title>Subparsec Jet Morphologies of M87 at 43 GHz: Effects of Asymmetric Plasmoids within the Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio observations of the M87 jet reveal limb-brightened features that exhibit temporal variations, with the brighter limb side not remaining consistently fixed at the subparsec scales. Utilizing a force-free jet model that considers exclusively the relativistic plasma dynamics along large-scale magnetic fields attached onto the central black hole, we examine the effects of asymmetric plasmoid injections within the subparsec jet. At subparsec scales, the jet velocity is predominantly influenced by poloidal velocity, leading to distinctive characteristics in both the morphology and trajectories of the plasmoids injected within the jet. We explore the potential modifications to the limb-brightened subparsec jet images resulting from the injection of asymmetric, shearing plasma, which is traditionally considered solely under conditions of stationary and symmetric mass loading. By comparing the model jet properties with the 43 GHz observations of the M87 jet, it is suggested that the asymmetric injection of plasmoids within the jet offers a satisfactory explanation for the observed velocity variations and morphological dynamics of the M87 jet.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry in an interacting Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\pi}$ and $m_{\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\sigma}$ and $m_{\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

Abstract: The article (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) that motivates this comment provides, in particular, one answer to the following natural question: what is noncommutative geometry on a lattice? In the context of spectral triples, Marcolli and van Suijlekom define in op. cit. a Dirac operator on the lattice and identify the corresponding Spectral Action with the lattice Yang-Mills--Higgs system. In this comment we show that the continuum limit of this theory is the Yang-Mills action functional, without a Higgs scalar.

      <title>Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of spacetime: A quantum optics view of acceleration radiation and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Validity of relativistic hydrodynamics beyond local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium by constructing formal solutions of the Boltzmann moment equations in the relaxation time approximation. These solutions naturally decompose into a divergent gradient series and exponentially decaying non-perturbative modes that encode initial conditions. The non-perturbative contributions are essential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series, and the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium.
  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of non-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient expansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect both initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that hydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium, but because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective behavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable success of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the perturbations of massless scalar and electromagnetic fields on the magnetically charged black holes in string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory. We calculate the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) and discuss influences of black hole magnetic charge $Q_m$, coupling parameter $\epsilon$ and angular momentum $l$ on QNFs, emphasizing the relationship between these parameters and QNMs behavior. We find these results obtained through the AIM method are in good agreement with those of obtained by WKB method. The greybody factor is calculated by WKB method. The effects of these parameters $Q_m$ and $\epsilon$ on the greybody factor are also studied.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Probing Effective Black Hole Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works, a framework has been developed to describe (quantum) deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The key idea of this so-called Effective Metric Description (EMD) is to parametrise deformations of the classical Schwarzschild geometry by two functions that depend on a physical quantity and which are calculated in a self-consistent way as series expansions in the vicinity of the horizon. In this work we further strengthen this framework by first demonstrating that the corresponding series expansion coefficients can be completely and uniquely determined from measurements that are accessible for observers outside of the event horizon: we propose a Gedankenexperiment, consisting of probes following a free-falling trajectory that send signals to a stationary observer and show how an EMD can be constructed from suitable telemetric data. Furthermore, by linking the expansion coefficients of the EMD to the invariant eigenvalues of the energy momentum tensor, we determine a system of physical fields that provides an effective Einstein equation for the deformed black hole geometry. In the case of a simplified geometry and assuming that the metric deformations are small, we can write the leading order of the physical fields in a closed form in the metric functions. We illustrate our results at the example of the Hayward space-time.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational radiation emitted during a classical scattering process is known to exhibit two universal logarithmic terms in its soft frequency expansion. We show that these terms can be written in a way that makes the action of \emph{logarithmic translations} manifest. Invariance under log translations naturally explains a puzzling cancellation in the contribution from outgoing massless particles and leads to a recurrence relation for expected higher-order universal log soft terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

Although being a highly nonlinear event, second-order perturbation theory suffices and that nonlinearities may be derived by a simple bootstrapping procedure.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23153$\pm$0.00023, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a Rotating Black Hole in a Dehnen Galactic Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>(3+1)-dimensional compressible fluid as a (4+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fluid described by an Abelian Chern-Simons action principle in 4+1 dimensions is considered. Letting 3+1 dimensions correspond to the usual space and time, and assuming the fields to be independent of the fifth coordinate, the free theory provides an interpretation as a system of advection equations, where the advecting velocity field is defined as the null vector of the field strength tensor (curvature). The free theory possesses a number of conservation laws which turn out to be prototypical forms of helicity and entropy conservation. Coupling the Chern-Simons field to an external source, a new conserved charge density is obtained which has the form of the Rossby-Ertel's potential vorticity (PV). Finally, by identifying the external current with the Chern-Simons field in a gauge-invariant setting, based on non-relativistic ideas, a self-interacting action principle is obtained whose Euler-Lagrange equations correspond precisely to a classical dissipationless compressible (3+1)-dimensional fluid endowed with thermodynamics, with only one extra condition: a constraint on the initial profile of the PV. After analysing this constraint of the "Chern-Simons fluid formulation", we investigate the helicity conservation of general fluids, going beyond classical analyses of barotropic fluids and no-cross boundary conditions for vorticity (Moffatt 1969). A new fluid helicity invariant for barotropic fluids under generic boundary conditions is obtained and the role of baroclinity in the helicity production is clarified. Inside a region bounded by an isentropic surface, the theory's constraint on the PV gives an integral formula for the mass, and for the evolution of fluid helicity in the baroclinic case. Finally, for an ideal gas exact, steady solutions of the equations of motion are found in a rotating scenario, showing that Ferrel-cell like patterns are produced in a rotating planet.</description>

      <title>Geometry of effective field theory positivity cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positivity bounds are theoretical constraints on the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory. These bounds emerge from the requirement that a given effective field theory must be the low-energy limit of a relativistic quantum theory that satisfies the fundamental principles of unitarity, locality, and causality. The task of deriving these bounds can be reformulated as the geometric problem of finding the extremal representation of a closed convex cone~$\mathcal C_W$. More precisely, in the presence of multiple particle flavors, the forward-limit positivity cone $\mathcal C_W$ consists of all positive semi-definite tensors in $W =\left\{ S \in \mathrm{Sym}^2 (\mathrm{Sym}^2\, V^*)\oplus \mathrm{Sym}^2 \left({\Lambda}^2 V^*\right) : \tau S = S \right\}
  \subset \mathrm{Sym}^2(V^*\otimes V^*)$, where $\tau$ denotes transposition in the second and fourth tensor factor and $V\cong\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of flavors. In this work, we solve this question up to three flavors, i.e.~$n=3$, proving a full classification of all extremal elements in these cases. We furthermore study the implications of our findings, deriving the full positivity bounds for amplitudes with and without additional symmetries. In the cases with additional symmetries that we consider, we find that the so-called elastic bounds are sufficient to give rise to the full positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Inverse Hamiltonian reduction for affine W-algebras in type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all affine W-algebras in type A at generic level, a certain embedding of the affine W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of free fields. We proceed by constructing strict chiral quantizations of equivariant Slodowy slices, sheaves of $\hbar$-adic vertex algebras on the arc spaces of the slices, and then localizing them on quasi-Darboux open sets. We also provide a generalization for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of arbitrary vertex algebra objects in the Kazhdan-Lusztig category.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity in quantum field theory, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in various models of quantum field theory: free massive bosons and fermions on flat space and on spheres, holographic models, and lattice models with the UV-cutoff. In certain cases we find asymptotic behavior of Lanczos coefficients, which goes beyond previously observed universality. We confirm that in all cases the exponential growth of Krylov complexity satisfies the conjectural inequality, which generalizes the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. We discuss temperature dependence of Lanczos coefficients and note that the relation between the growth of Lanczos coefficients and chaos may only hold for the sufficiently late, truly asymptotic regime governed by the physics at the UV cutoff. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show scenarios when Krylov complexity in quantum field theory behaves qualitatively differently from the holographic complexity.</description>

Abstract: The field theoretic ADHM instantons have stringy generalizations as linear sigma models. These were constructed by Witten in 1995. Recently Ali and Ilahi constructed a complementary version related to Witten's construction by a duality. In this note we generalize these to a complete ADHM instanton linear sigma model, as suggested by Witten, in which above duality is promoted to a $Z_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order expression for the dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$), and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contain the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in two novel transport coefficients given by the correlation between spin density tensor and rotational stress tensor and vice versa. Additionally, the newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally, we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors: $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Structure of ADHM Sigma Models and $AdS_3$ Superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the supersymmetry structure of ADHM instanton linear sigma models, $N=4$ superconformal algebras and superconformal field theories dual to superstrings moving in $AdS_3$ backgrounds in view of some of our recent findings in various investigations. First of all we collect information about the (0, 4) supersymmetries of Witten's original, Ali-Ilahi's complementary and Ali-Salih's complete ADHM instanton linear sigma models. Then we collect information about large, small and middle $N=4$ superconformal algebras and summarize their interrelations with the ADHM instanton linear sigma models. We then argue that the former, that is the supersymmetry of the ADHM instanton linear sigma models, flows to latter, that is the small, middle and large $N=4$ superconformal symmetries, in the infrared limit. Finally we summarize the mapping of these $N=4$ superconformal symmetries onto the superconformal symmetries dual to superstrings moving on $AdS_3\times S^3\times {\mathcal M}^4$ backgrounds with ${\mathcal M}^=K3, T^4$ and $S^3\times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Mutual information from modular flow in CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators in the replica trick framework enables a long-distance expansion of the mutual information (MI) in conformal field theories (CFTs). In this expansion, the terms are labeled by primary operators, as contributions from descendant operators can be resummed into conformal blocks. However, for the MI, the expansion involves primaries from the multi-replica theory, which includes far more operators than those in the original theory. In this work, we develop a method to resum this series, yielding an expansion in terms of the primaries of the original theory, specifically restricted to the two-copy sector. This is achieved by expressing the twist operators in a non-local manner across different replicas and using a modular flow representation to obtain the n -&gt; 1 limit of the R\'enyi index. We explicitly compute the resulting "enhanced conformal blocks", which, surprisingly, provide excellent approximations to the MI of generalized free fields across the full range of cross ratios. Remarkably, this approximation appears to be exact in the limit of large spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Corrections in Double Field Theory via Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the off-shell formulation of the Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks. The main example is Double Field Theory (DFT), emerging as the the off-shell DC of Yang-Mills theory up to cubic order in perturbations. Extending this procedure to a higher-derivative gauge theory gives rise to a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that the quadratic contributions of HDDT are directly related (up to field redefinitions) to DFT+, a T-duality invariant model associated with the bosonic string that incorporates first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the off-shell DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a novel Bounce Universe model constructed within the framework of Horndeski gravity. We have analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and evaluated the corresponding non-Gaussianities for this specific model. The non-linear parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ was computed for various wave vector configurations, including: (i) the local configuration, (ii) the equilateral configuration, and (iii) the enfolded configuration, which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal shapes. We demonstrate that the observational constraints on the scalar spectrum index tilt and the scalar-to-tensor ratio, together with the unitarity bounds, ensure that the bounds from non-Gaussianities are trivially satisfied. Therefore, this particular Bounce Universe scenario is fully viable in light of modern observational data.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$, both meeting at a saddle point with radius $r_{+s}$ at temperature $T_s$. We derive the thermodynamics, finding that the heat capacity diverges at the turning point $T_s$ for each solution. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a transition to hot flat space with charge at infinity. For a given $Q$ and $T&gt;T_s$, there is only hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d=4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d=5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature, photon and shadow radii, quasinormal modes (QNMs), time domain profiles, greybody factors, emission rates and topological characteristics of deformed black holes, focusing on the effects of the deformation parameter $ \alpha $ and control parameter $ \beta $. Increasing $ \alpha $ enhances the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves, while $ \beta $ shows non-linear behaviour. Electromagnetic perturbations exhibit similar trends, though with lower frequencies and damping rates. Greybody factors are mainly influenced by multipole moment $l$ and $ \alpha $, with $ \beta $ having a more subtle effect. These findings provide insights into black hole dynamics, mergers, and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>A basic triad in Macdonald theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding the Macdonald polynomials into the Noumi-Shiraishi functions and their reduction to solutions of simple linear equations at particular values of $t$. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory. We discuss lifting the triad to an elliptic generalization of the Noumi-Shiraishi functions. The central unknown ingredient is linear equations, for which we discuss various possible approaches, including immediate elliptic deformation of periodicity conditions, (elliptic) Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra operators, and elliptic Kostka coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the thermodynamic properties and stability of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, focusing on the effects of deformation ($\alpha$) and thermal correction parameters ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) on phase transitions and heat capacity. The results show that higher $\alpha$ values raise the Hawking-Page critical temperature, enhancing thermal stability. Thermal corrections significantly affect smaller black holes but minimally impact larger ones, leaving second-order phase transitions unchanged. Heat capacity analysis identifies stability regions, with sign changes marking instability. These findings highlight the role of deformation and thermal corrections in black hole stability, offering insights for extending our understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strenghts has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems on the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Classification of Modular Symmetries in Type IIB Flux Landscape</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study modular symmetries in type IIB flux landscape by investigating symplectic basis transformations of period vectors on toroidal orbifolds. To fix explicit cycles of a third-cohomology basis regarding the untwisted complex structure modulus, which is necessary to construct the period vectors, we find that the following two symmetries are required for the period vectors: (i) ``Scaling duality '' which is a generalized $S$-transformation of $PSL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and (ii) the modular symmetries to be consistent with symmetries derived from mass spectra of the closed string in type IIB string theory. Furthermore, by considering flux quanta on the cycles, we explore type IIB flux vacua on toroidal orientifolds and flux transformations under the modular symmetries of the period vectors.</description>

      <title>Fine Spectrum from Crude Analytic Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and Geometric Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles-Carroll and Galilean-within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate a new set of dualities between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles in gauge fields. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a framework for coupling fracton gauge fields and background geometry, linking them to non-Lorentzian spacetimes and deriving the corresponding constraint on geometry. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>On the information behavior from quadratically coupled accelerated detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to investigate the information behavior of quantum systems through accelerated detectors quadratically coupled with a massless scalar field. In addition, we made detailed comparisons with the case of linear coupling. The perturbative method was used to evolve the density matrix that describes the interaction of the detector-field system during a finite time. The systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and the which-path distinguishability circuit. The results on the probability transition rates show that quadratic coupling amplifies the Unruh effect. This is due to the modification of the interaction structure, allowing the simultaneous absorption of multiple quanta. Our findings showed that the information is degraded more quickly in the case of quadratic coupling, when compared to the linear case. Furthermore, this change is mainly given by the coupling constant and by an additional factor that arises in the case of quadratic coupling. Therefore, these results indicate that the nature of the coupling between the detector and the field plays a fundamental role in the behavior of quantum information in high acceleration regimes.</description>

Abstract: The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</description>

      <title>Hotter and Colder Than Unruh: Probing the Kappa Rindler Vacuum with an Accelerated Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of an accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector to a one-parameter family of "kappa Rindler" vacua, which generalize the standard Unruh effect. These states, parameterized by $\kappa$, continuously interpolate between the Rindler ($\kappa \to 0$) and Minkowski ($\kappa=1$) vacua. We find the detector registers a perfect thermal bath at a tunable temperature $T_\kappa = \kappa T_U$. This result establishes a framework for environments perceived as both "hotter" ($\kappa&gt;1$) and "colder" ($\kappa&lt;1$) than the standard Unruh temperature. We establish this thermality by demonstrating the KMS condition for the Wightman function and by analyzing the associated particle creation process. Furthermore, we visualize the spacetime structure of the created field quanta, revealing an intuitive link between the $\kappa$-controlled symmetry of the modes and the perceived temperature. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for a modulated Unruh effect, bridging formal QFT with clear visual intuition.</description>

Abstract: We compute holographic timelike entanglement entropy for quantum BTZ black holes in a Karch-Randall braneworld scenario. These black holes are exact solutions of massive 3d gravity on the brane and are conjectured to be dual to thermal states in 2d defect CFTs, living at the interface of the brane and the boundary of the bulk $AdS_4$. Our analysis reveals an interesting relation between the tEE and the central charge pertaining to the dual CFT, which receives nontrivial corrections due to quantum backreaction effects on the Karch-Randall brane, which is explored non-perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic renormalization group (RG) setting in which a 4-dimensional ($4d$) quantum field theory at a finite cutoff corresponds to/is described by the Einstein gravity on a part of AdS$_{5}$ space, cutoff at a finite radius. This holographic setting has interesting and important implications for the $4d$ field theory: Deformation of the field theory by a certain combination involving the square of its energy-momentum tensor can be alternatively viewed as formulating the field theory on a background with a dynamical metric. Explicitly, starting with a non-gravitating $4d$ field theory in the UV, flowing to the IR, quantum effects that we compute using the classical $5d$ Einstein gravity theory, induce an effective $4d$ Einstein gravity theory. In other words, we show that gravity is not a fundamental force and is an effective description of quantum effects in the IR limit.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a three-dimensional bi-vector-tensor theory of the generalized Proca class by regularizing the Gauss-Bonnet invariant within the Weyl geometry. We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a claimed new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

Abstract: The advancement in gravitational wave detection has made it necessary to study the nonlinear effects in black hole perturbation theory. For the most interesting Kerr background, the current basis of the study, the Teukolsky equation, is given in terms of the Weyl scalars and elaborated metric reconstruction schemes are needed to obtain the full metric perturbation. In this work, I present two complementary and fully separated solutions to the metric perturbation equations directly.</description>

      <title>QCD with an Infrared Fixed Point and a Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following previous work we further explore the possibility that the chirally broken phase of gauge theories admits an infrared fixed point interpretation. The slope of the $\beta$ function, $\beta'_*$, is found to vanish at the infrared fixed point which has several attractive features such as logarithmic running. We provide a more in-depth analysis of our previous result that the mass anomalous assumes $\gamma_* = 1$ at the fixed point. The results are found to be consistent with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In a second part the specific properties of a dilaton, the (pseudo) Goldstone, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated. Dilaton soft theorems indicate that a soft dilaton mass can only originate from an operator of scaling dimension two. In the gauge theory this role is taken on by the $\bar qq$-operator. The QCD dilaton candidate, the $\sigma = f_0(500)$ meson is investigated. Singlet-octet mixing is found to be important. We briefly discuss the dilaton as a candidate for the Higgs boson, which relies on the ratio of dilaton to pion decay constant being close to unity. In QCD this is approximately satisfied but it is remains unclear if this is accidental or whether there is unknown reason behind it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the simple affine vertex algebra $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$ associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ at level $\mathsf{k} = -3+\frac{\mathsf{u}}{2}$, for $\mathsf{u}\ge3$ odd. Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Fusion 3-Categories for Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fusion 3-categorical symmetries for quantum theories in (3+1)d with self-duality defects. Such defects have been realized physically by half-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian group $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These fusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion 3-categories $(\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard 4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the extension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two 4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly in 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the aforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality defects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the fusion 3-category $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule 3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the Picard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is completely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by topological surface defects of the SymTFT. These are classified by a finite abelian group equipped with an alternating 2-form. We relate the Picard 4-groupoid of the corresponding braided fusion 3-categories with a generalized Witt group constructed from certain graded braided fusion 1-categories using a twisted Deligne tensor product. We perform explicit computations for $\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4$ graded $\mathbf{3TY}$ categories.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum cohomology possesses the structure of a difference module by shift operators (Seidel representation) of equivariant parameters. Teleman's conjecture suggests that shift operators and equivariant parameters acting on QH_T(X) should be identified, respectively, with the Novikov variables and the quantum connection of the GIT quotient X//T. This can be interpreted as a form of Fourier duality between equivariant quantum cohomology (D-module) of X and quantum cohomology (D-module) of the GIT quotient X//T.
  We introduce the notion of "quantum volume," derived from Givental's path integral over the Floer fundamental cycle, and present a conjectural Fourier duality relationship between the T-equivariant quantum volume of X and the quantum volume of X//T. We also explore the "reduction conjecture," developed in collaboration with Fumihiko Sanda, which expresses the I-function of X//T as a discrete Fourier transform of the equivariant J-function of X. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology to observe toric mirror symmetry and prove a decomposition of quantum cohomology D-modules of projective bundles or blowups.</description>

      <title>Degenerate higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength whose kinetic matrices are degenerate. This provides a generalisation of quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories for a U(1) gauge field. After establishing a classification of the independent Lagrangians, we obtain all the theories with at most third order field equations involving only second order derivatives of the metric, thus generalising Horndeski's quadratic theory for a gauge field. Some of these are shown to be conformally invariant. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Inverse Hamiltonian reduction in type A and generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all finite W-algebras in type $A$, a certain embedding of the finite W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of differential operators. We first prove a classical analogue for equivariant Slodowy slices using multiplication maps on generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian, then deduce the result for equivariant finite W-algebras by Fedosov quantization. This implies the statement for finite W-algebras, as well as Kostant-Whittaker reductions of arbitrary algebras in the category of Harish Chandra bimodules, including quantizations of Moore-Tachikawa varieties.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Properties of solutions by the Schwinger-Dyson equation at finite temperature and density : A four-fermion interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained.
  We investigate the reasons for this situation by examining the convergence of the solutions obtained by iterative method. We also consider the solution of the SDE using alternative methods. Furthermore, we compare these results with analytical solutions at zero temperature and discuss the relation with the behavior of the effective potential. We extend these considerations to finite temperatures.
  Based on these analyses, we consider ways to avoid spurious solutions that appear in the iterative method.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Feynman integrals for leading colour $t\bar{t}W$ production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute a complete set of the two-loop Feynman integrals that are required for the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to on-shell top-pair production in association with a $W$ boson at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation. These Feynman integrals also contribute to Higgs or $Z$-boson production in association with a top pair. We employ the method of differential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to handle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. The presence of the top quark in the virtual propagators, in addition to the mass of the external $W$ boson, gives rise to nested square roots and three elliptic curves. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear, and are $\epsilon$-factorised otherwise. We express the DEs in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms, separating the logarithmic ones. We solve the DEs numerically in the physical kinematic region, with the method of generalised power series expansions.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DDM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we contrast previous results with a frequentist analysis of Planck and SDSS BAO data. We find that the $68\%$ confidence level region corresponds to a decay half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$~km/s. These $1\sigma$ constraints strongly differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effect in the Bayesian analysis. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $\sim 1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial amplitude $A_s$ and spectral index $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We note that without such priors, the scales best measured by KiDS-1000 do not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, so $S_8$ constraints should not be applied directly to a model in place of the full likelihood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules. For example, the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, with one of its flavor components slightly differing from the other two, deviates from the exact $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, and this deviation is characterized by the exact $SU(3)$ flavor octet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms implies the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. In the standard theory of generalized functions, if the outset (origin) function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule, the complexity of Radon transforms becomes in question. In the paper, we discuss the Fourier slice theorem analyzing the degenerated (singular) points as possible sources of the complexity. We also demonstrate the different methods to generate the needed complexity on the intermediate stage of calculations. Besides, we show that the introduction of the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensures naturally the corresponding complexity. The discussed complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented methods can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Leading Logarithm Quantum Gravity II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel in which we derive and simplify the gravitational equations that apply in accelerating cosmological spacetimes. Solutions to these equations should be tantamount to all order resummations of the perturbative leading logarithms. We also discuss possible phenomenological applications to cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Lagrangian and fermion mass of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model of elementary particles the fermions are assumed to be intrinsically massless. Here we propose a new theoretical idea of fermion mass generation (other than by the Higgs mechanism) through the coupling with the vector gauge fields of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge symmetry, especially with the $Z$ boson of the weak interaction that affects all elementary fermions. The resulting small masses are suggested to be proportional to the self-energy of the $Z$ field as described by a Yukawa potential. Thereby the electrically neutral neutrino just gets a tiny mass through its $Z$-field coupling. In contrast, the electrically charged electron and quarks can become more massive by the inertia induced through the Coulomb energy of the electrostatic fields surrounding them in their rest frames.</description>
