      <title>Real-time volumetric free-hand ultrasound imaging for large-sized organs: A study of imaging the whole spine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging can overcome the limitations of conventional two dimensional (2D) ultrasound imaging in structural observation and measurement. However, conducting volumetric ultrasound imaging for large-sized organs still faces difficulties including long acquisition time, inevitable patient movement, and 3D feature recognition. In this study, we proposed a real-time volumetric free-hand ultrasound imaging system optimized for the above issues and applied it to the clinical diagnosis of scoliosis. This study employed an incremental imaging method coupled with algorithmic acceleration to enable real-time processing and visualization of the large amounts of data generated when scanning large-sized organs. Furthermore, to deal with the difficulty of image feature recognition, we proposed two tissue segmentation algorithms to reconstruct and visualize the spinal anatomy in 3D space by approximating the depth at which the bone structures are located and segmenting the ultrasound images at different depths. We validated the adaptability of our system by deploying it to multiple models of ultra-sound equipment and conducting experiments using different types of ultrasound probes. We also conducted experiments on 6 scoliosis patients and 10 normal volunteers to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Ultrasound imaging of a volunteer spine from shoulder to crotch (more than 500 mm) was performed in 2 minutes, and the 3D imaging results displayed in real-time were compared with the corresponding X-ray images with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 in spinal curvature. Our proposed volumetric ultrasound imaging system might hold the potential to be clinically applied to other large-sized organs.</description>

      <title>DYRECT Computed Tomography: DYnamic Reconstruction of Events on a Continuous Timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved high-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (4D $\mu$CT) is an imaging technique that offers insight into the evolution of dynamic processes inside materials that are opaque to visible light. Conventional tomographic reconstruction techniques are based on recording a sequence of 3D images that represent the sample state at different moments in time. This frame-based approach limits the temporal resolution compared to dynamic radiography experiments due to the time needed to make CT scans. Moreover, it leads to an inflation of the amount of data and thus to costly post-processing computations to quantify the dynamic behaviour from the sequence of time frames, hereby often ignoring the temporal correlations of the sample structure. Our proposed 4D $\mu$CT reconstruction technique, named DYRECT, estimates individual attenuation evolution profiles for each position in the sample. This leads to a novel memory-efficient event-based representation of the sample, using as little as three image volumes: its initial attenuation, its final attenuation and the transition times. This third volume represents local events on a continuous timescale instead of the discrete global time frames. We propose a method to iteratively reconstruct the transition times and the attenuation volumes. The dynamic reconstruction technique was validated on synthetic ground truth data and experimental data, and was found to effectively pinpoint the transition times in the synthetic dataset with a time resolution corresponding to less than a tenth of the amount of projections required to reconstruct traditional $\mu$CT time frames.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Feature Enhancement in Multi-task Learning for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning methods in medical imaging often focus solely on segmentation or classification, limiting their ability to leverage shared information. Multi-task learning (MTL) addresses this by combining both tasks through shared representations but often struggles to balance local spatial features for segmentation and global semantic features for classification, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective UNet-based MTL model, where features extracted by the encoder are used to predict classification labels, while the decoder produces the segmentation mask. The model introduces an advanced encoder incorporating a novel ResFormer block that integrates local context from convolutional feature extraction with long-range dependencies modeled by the Transformer. This design captures broader contextual relationships and fine-grained details, improving classification and segmentation accuracy. To enhance classification performance, multi-scale features from different encoder levels are combined to leverage the hierarchical representation of the input image. For segmentation, the features passed to the decoder via skip connections are refined using a novel dilated feature enhancement (DFE) module, which captures information at different scales through three parallel convolution branches with varying dilation rates. This allows the decoder to detect lesions of varying sizes with greater accuracy. Experimental results across multiple medical datasets confirm the superior performance of our model in both segmentation and classification tasks, compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task learning methods.</description>

      <title>DeepFGS: Fine-Grained Scalable Coding for Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable coding, which can adapt to channel bandwidth variation, performs well in today's complex network environment. However, most existing scalable compression methods face two challenges: reduced compression performance and insufficient scalability. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a learned fine-grained scalable image compression framework, namely DeepFGS. Specifically, we introduce a feature separation backbone to divide the image information into basic and scalable features, then redistribute the features channel by channel through an information rearrangement strategy. In this way, we can generate a continuously scalable bitstream via one-pass encoding. For entropy coding, we design a mutual entropy model to fully explore the correlation between the basic and scalable features. In addition, we reuse the decoder to reduce the parameters and computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DeepFGS outperforms previous learning-based scalable image compression models and traditional scalable image codecs in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Prior Latent Space Diffusion model for Reconstruction of Lumbar Vertebrae from Thick Slice MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lumbar spine problems are ubiquitous, motivating research into targeted imaging for treatment planning and guided interventions. While high resolution and high contrast CT has been the modality of choice, MRI can capture both bone and soft tissue without the ionizing radiation of CT albeit longer acquisition time. The critical trade-off between contrast quality and acquisition time has motivated 'thick slice MRI', which prioritises faster imaging with high in-plane resolution but variable contrast and low through-plane resolution. We investigate a recently developed post-acquisition pipeline which segments vertebrae from thick-slice acquisitions and uses a variational autoencoder to enhance quality after an initial 3D reconstruction. We instead propose a latent space diffusion energy-based prior to leverage diffusion models, which exhibit high-quality image generation. Crucially, we mitigate their high computational cost and low sample efficiency by learning an energy-based latent representation to perform the diffusion processes. Our resulting method outperforms existing approaches across metrics including Dice and VS scores, and more faithfully captures 3D features.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution Guided 3D GANs for Medical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image translation is the process of converting from one imaging modality to another, in order to reduce the need for multiple image acquisitions from the same patient. This can enhance the efficiency of treatment by reducing the time, equipment, and labor needed. In this paper, we introduce a multi-resolution guided Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework for 3D medical image translation. Our framework uses a 3D multi-resolution Dense-Attention UNet (3D-mDAUNet) as the generator and a 3D multi-resolution UNet as the discriminator, optimized with a unique combination of loss functions including voxel-wise GAN loss and 2.5D perception loss. Our approach yields promising results in volumetric image quality assessment (IQA) across a variety of imaging modalities, body regions, and age groups, demonstrating its robustness. Furthermore, we propose a synthetic-to-real applicability assessment as an additional evaluation to assess the effectiveness of synthetic data in downstream applications such as segmentation. This comprehensive evaluation shows that our method produces synthetic medical images not only of high-quality but also potentially useful in clinical applications.

      <title>Deep Learning for Longitudinal Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation in MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. However, manual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming and prone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to overcome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, our team, $\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volume segmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinal GTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet with deep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset of pre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dice similarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to models trained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-aware attention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate features learned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slight improvements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI with pre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10 pre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 for primary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1. For Task 2, the ensemble of 10 mid-RT segmentation models attained an average DSCagg of 0.733, with 0.607 for GTVp and 0.859 for GTVn, leading us to $\textbf{achieve 1st place}$. In summary, we presented a collection of DL models that could facilitate GTV segmentation in MRgART, offering the potential to streamline radiation oncology workflows. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/xtie97/HNTS-MRG24-UWLAIR.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Supervised Approach with Error Reflection for Echocardiography Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting internal structure from echocardiography is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of various heart diseases. Semi-supervised learning shows its ability in alleviating annotations scarcity. While existing semi-supervised methods have been successful in image segmentation across various medical imaging modalities, few have attempted to design methods specifically addressing the challenges posed by the poor contrast, blurred edge details and noise of echocardiography. These characteristics pose challenges to the generation of high-quality pseudo-labels in semi-supervised segmentation based on Mean Teacher. Inspired by human reflection on erroneous practices, we devise an error reflection strategy for echocardiography semi-supervised segmentation architecture. The process triggers the model to reflect on inaccuracies in unlabeled image segmentation, thereby enhancing the robustness of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, the strategy is divided into two steps. The first step is called reconstruction reflection. The network is tasked with reconstructing authentic proxy images from the semantic masks of unlabeled images and their auxiliary sketches, while maximizing the structural similarity between the original inputs and the proxies. The second step is called guidance correction. Reconstruction error maps decouple unreliable segmentation regions. Then, reliable data that are more likely to occur near high-density areas are leveraged to guide the optimization of unreliable data potentially located around decision boundaries. Additionally, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy, termed as multi-scale mixing up strategy, to minimize the empirical distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled images and perceive diverse scales of cardiac anatomical structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>TSUBF-Net: Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network with Bi-direction Fusion for Segmentation of Adenoid Hypertrophy in CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adenoid hypertrophy stands as a common cause of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome in children. It is characterized by snoring, nasal congestion, and growth disorders. Computed Tomography (CT) emerges as a pivotal medical imaging modality, utilizing X-rays and advanced computational techniques to generate detailed cross-sectional images. Within the realm of pediatric airway assessments, CT imaging provides an insightful perspective on the shape and volume of enlarged adenoids. Despite the advances of deep learning methods for medical imaging analysis, there remains an emptiness in the segmentation of adenoid hypertrophy in CT scans. To address this research gap, we introduce TSUBF-Nett (Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network based on Bi-direction Fusion), a 3D medical image segmentation framework. TSUBF-Net is engineered to effectively discern intricate 3D spatial interlayer features in CT scans and enhance the extraction of boundary-blurring features. Notably, we propose two innovative modules within the U-shaped network architecture:the Trans-Spatial Perception module (TSP) and the Bi-directional Sampling Collaborated Fusion module (BSCF).These two modules are in charge of operating during the sampling process and strategically fusing down-sampled and up-sampled features, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce the Sobel loss term, which optimizes the smoothness of the segmentation results and enhances model accuracy. Extensive 3D segmentation experiments are conducted on several datasets. TSUBF-Net is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with the lowest HD95: 7.03, IoU:85.63, and DSC: 92.26 on our own AHSD dataset. The results in the other two public datasets also demonstrate that our methods can robustly and effectively address the challenges of 3D segmentation in CT scans.</description>

      <title>DVasMesh: Deep Structured Mesh Reconstruction from Vascular Images for Dynamics Modeling of Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vessel dynamics simulation is vital in studying the relationship between geometry and vascular disease progression. Reliable dynamics simulation relies on high-quality vascular meshes. Most of the existing mesh generation methods highly depend on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and laborious, usually facing challenges such as branch merging and vessel disconnection. This will hinder vessel dynamics simulation, especially for the population study. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based method, dubbed as DVasMesh to directly generate structured hexahedral vascular meshes from vascular images. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose to formally formulate each vertex of the vascular graph by a four-element vector, including coordinates of the centerline point and the radius. Second, a vectorized graph template is employed to guide DVasMesh to estimate the vascular graph. Specifically, we introduce a sampling operator, which samples the extracted features of the vascular image (by a segmentation network) according to the vertices in the template graph. Third, we employ a graph convolution network (GCN) and take the sampled features as nodes to estimate the deformation between vertices of the template graph and target graph, and the deformed graph template is used to build the mesh. Taking advantage of end-to-end learning and discarding direct dependency on annotated labels, our DVasMesh demonstrates outstanding performance in generating structured vascular meshes on cardiac and cerebral vascular images. It shows great potential for clinical applications by reducing mesh generation time from 2 hours (manual) to 30 seconds (automatic).</description>

      <title>DPE-Net: Dual-Parallel Encoder Based Network for Semantic Segmentation of Polyps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, efficient segmentation of colon polyps plays a pivotal role in minimally invasive solutions for colorectal cancer. This study introduces a novel approach employing two parallel encoder branches within a network for polyp segmentation. One branch of the encoder incorporates the dual convolution blocks that have the capability to maintain feature information over increased depths, and the other block embraces the single convolution block with the addition of the previous layer's feature, offering diversity in feature extraction within the encoder, combining them before transpose layers with a depth-wise concatenation operation. Our model demonstrated superior performance, surpassing several established deep-learning architectures on the Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieved a Dice score of 0.919, a mIoU of 0.866 for the Kvasir dataset, and a Dice score of 0.931 and a mIoU of 0.891 for the CVC-ClinicDB. The visual and quantitative results highlight the efficacy of our model, potentially setting a new model in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Embryo 2.0: Merging Synthetic and Real Data for Advanced AI Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate embryo morphology assessment is essential in assisted reproductive technology for selecting the most viable embryo. Artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance this process. However, the limited availability of embryo data presents challenges for training deep learning models. To address this, we trained two generative models using two datasets, one we created and made publicly available, and one existing public dataset, to generate synthetic embryo images at various cell stages, including 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst. These were combined with real images to train classification models for embryo cell stage prediction. Our results demonstrate that incorporating synthetic images alongside real data improved classification performance, with the model achieving 97% accuracy compared to 95% when trained solely on real data. Notably, even when trained exclusively on synthetic data and tested on real data, the model achieved a high accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from both generative models yielded better classification results than using data from a single generative model. Four embryologists evaluated the fidelity of the synthetic images through a Turing test, during which they annotated inaccuracies and offered feedback. The analysis showed the diffusion model outperformed the generative adversarial network model, deceiving embryologists 66.6% versus 25.3% and achieving lower Frechet inception distance scores.</description>

Abstract: Scoliosis is traditionally assessed based solely on 2D lateral deviations, but recent studies have also revealed the importance of other imaging planes in understanding the deformation of the spine. Consequently, extracting the spinal geometry in 3D would help quantify these spinal deformations and aid diagnosis. In this study, we propose an automated general framework to estimate the 3D spine shape from 2D DXA scans. We achieve this by explicitly predicting the sagittal view of the spine from the DXA scan. Using these two orthogonal projections of the spine (coronal in DXA, and sagittal from the prediction), we are able to describe the 3D shape of the spine. The prediction is learnt from over 30k paired images of DXA and MRI scans. We assess the performance of the method on a held out test set, and achieve high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Take Your Steps: Hierarchically Efficient Pulmonary Disease Screening via CT Volume Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used to process Computed Tomography (CT) data in the automated screening of pulmonary diseases, significantly reducing the workload of physicians. However, the three-dimensional nature of CT volumes involves an excessive number of voxels, which significantly increases the complexity of model processing. Previous screening approaches often overlook this issue, which undoubtedly reduces screening efficiency. Towards efficient and effective screening, we design a hierarchical approach to reduce the computational cost of pulmonary disease screening. The new approach re-organizes the screening workflows into three steps. First, we propose a Computed Tomography Volume Compression (CTVC) method to select a small slice subset that comprehensively represents the whole CT volume. Second, the selected CT slices are used to detect pulmonary diseases coarsely via a lightweight classification model. Third, an uncertainty measurement strategy is applied to identify samples with low diagnostic confidence, which are re-detected by radiologists. Experiments on two public pulmonary disease datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy and recall while reducing the time by 50%-70% compared with the counterparts using full CT volumes. Besides, we also found that our approach outperforms previous cutting-edge CTVC methods in retaining important indications after compression.</description>

      <title>Residual Attention Single-Head Vision Transformer Network for Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis in Noisy Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rolling bearings play a crucial role in industrial machinery, directly influencing equipment performance, durability, and safety. However, harsh operating conditions, such as high speeds and temperatures, often lead to bearing malfunctions, resulting in downtime, economic losses, and safety hazards. This paper proposes the Residual Attention Single-Head Vision Transformer Network (RA-SHViT-Net) for fault diagnosis in rolling bearings. Vibration signals are transformed from the time to frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) before being processed by RA-SHViT-Net. The model employs the Single-Head Vision Transformer (SHViT) to capture local and global features, balancing computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To enhance feature extraction, the Adaptive Hybrid Attention Block (AHAB) integrates channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The network architecture includes Depthwise Convolution, Single-Head Self-Attention, Residual Feed-Forward Networks (Res-FFN), and AHAB modules, ensuring robust feature representation and mitigating gradient vanishing issues. Evaluation on the Case Western Reserve University and Paderborn University datasets demonstrates the RA-SHViT-Net's superior accuracy and robustness in complex, noisy environments. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of individual components, establishing RA-SHViT-Net as an effective tool for early fault detection and classification, promoting efficient maintenance strategies in industrial settings.

      <title>Auto-Encoded Supervision for Perceptual Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles the fidelity objective in the perceptual super-resolution~(SR). Specifically, we address the shortcomings of pixel-level $L_\text{p}$ loss ($\mathcal{L}_\text{pix}$) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since $L_\text{pix}$ is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality, prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However, this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly, we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of $L_\text{pix}$ that contributes to blurring, and 2) only guiding based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that they can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner, with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained with $L_\text{pix}$. Accordingly, we propose the Auto-Encoded Supervision for Optimal Penalization loss ($L_\text{AESOP}$), a novel loss function that measures distance in the AE space, instead of the raw pixel space. Note that the AE space indicates the space after the decoder, not the bottleneck. By simply substituting $L_\text{pix}$ with $L_\text{AESOP}$, we can provide effective reconstruction guidance without compromising perceptual quality. Designed for simplicity, our method enables easy integration into existing SR frameworks. Experimental results verify that AESOP can lead to favorable results in the perceptual SR task.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Fine-tuning of Vision Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification Under Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision tasks, but their success heavily depends on the quality of the training data. Noisy labels are a critical issue in medical datasets and can significantly degrade model performance. Previous clean sample selection methods have not utilized the well pre-trained features of vision foundation models (VFMs) and assumed that training begins from scratch. In this paper, we propose CUFIT, a curriculum fine-tuning paradigm of VFMs for medical image classification under label noise. Our method is motivated by the fact that linear probing of VFMs is relatively unaffected by noisy samples, as it does not update the feature extractor of the VFM, thus robustly classifying the training samples. Subsequently, curriculum fine-tuning of two adapters is conducted, starting with clean sample selection from the linear probing phase. Our experimental results demonstrate that CUFIT outperforms previous methods across various medical image benchmarks. Specifically, our method surpasses previous baselines by 5.0%, 2.1%, 4.6%, and 5.8% at a 40% noise rate on the HAM10000, APTOS-2019, BloodMnist, and OrgancMnist datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we provide extensive analyses to demonstrate the impact of our method on noisy label detection. For instance, our method shows higher label precision and recall compared to previous approaches. Our work highlights the potential of leveraging VFMs in medical image classification under challenging conditions of noisy labels.</description>

      <title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and LiDAR data within new linear feature spaces offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by the high-dimensionality and redundancy inherent in HSIs. This study introduces a dual linear fused space framework that capitalizes on bidirectional reversed convolutional neural network (CNN) pathways, coupled with a specialized spatial analysis block. This approach combines the computational efficiency of CNNs with the adaptability of attention mechanisms, facilitating the effective fusion of spectral and spatial information. The proposed method not only enhances data processing and classification accuracy, but also mitigates the computational burden typically associated with advanced models such as Transformers. Evaluations of the Houston 2013 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. This advancement underscores the potential of the framework in resource-constrained environments and its significant contributions to the field of remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Fusing Physics-Driven Strategies and Cross-Modal Adversarial Learning: Toward Multi-Domain Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of cross-modal adversarial learning and physics-driven methods represents a cutting-edge direction for tackling challenges in complex multi-modal tasks and scientific computing. This review focuses on systematically analyzing how these two approaches can be synergistically integrated to enhance performance and robustness across diverse application domains. By addressing key obstacles such as modality discrepancies, limited data availability, and insufficient model robustness, this paper highlights the role of physics-based optimization frameworks in facilitating efficient and interpretable adversarial perturbation generation. The review also explores significant advancements in cross-modal adversarial learning, including applications in tasks such as image cross-modal retrieval (e.g., infrared and RGB matching), scientific computing (e.g., solving partial differential equations), and optimization under physical consistency constraints in vision systems. By examining theoretical foundations and experimental outcomes, this study demonstrates the potential of combining these approaches to handle complex scenarios and improve the security of multi-modal systems. Finally, we outline future directions, proposing a novel framework that unifies physical principles with adversarial optimization, providing a pathway for researchers to develop robust and adaptable cross-modal learning methods with both theoretical and practical significance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Skin Cancer Diagnosis (SCD) Using Late Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and New Swarm-Based Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skin cancer (SC) stands out as one of the most life-threatening forms of cancer, with its danger amplified if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early intervention is critical, as it allows for more effective treatment approaches. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in the early detection and skin cancer diagnosis (SCD). Although the DL seems promising for the diagnosis of skin cancer, still ample scope exists for improving model efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to skin cancer detection, utilizing optimization techniques in conjunction with pre-trained networks and wavelet transformations. First, normalized images will undergo pre-trained networks such as Densenet-121, Inception, Xception, and MobileNet to extract hierarchical features from input images. After feature extraction, the feature maps are passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to capture low and high-frequency components. Then the self-attention module is integrated to learn global dependencies between features and focus on the most relevant parts of the feature maps. The number of neurons and optimization of the weight vectors are performed using three new swarm-based optimization techniques, such as Modified Gorilla Troops Optimizer (MGTO), Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO), and Fox optimization algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that optimizing weight vectors using optimization algorithms can enhance diagnostic accuracy and make it a highly effective approach for SCD. The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy, achieving top rates of 98.11% with the MobileNet + Wavelet + FOX and DenseNet + Wavelet + Fox combination on the ISIC-2016 dataset and 97.95% with the Inception + Wavelet + MGTO combination on the ISIC-2017 dataset, which improves accuracy by at least 1% compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Good, Cheap, and Fast: Overfitted Image Compression with Wasserstein Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative image models, recent work on learned image compression increasingly focuses on better probabilistic models of the natural image distribution, leading to excellent image quality. This, however, comes at the expense of a computational complexity that is several orders of magnitude higher than today's commercial codecs, and thus prohibitive for most practical applications. With this paper, we demonstrate that by focusing on modeling visual perception rather than the data distribution, we can achieve a very good trade-off between visual quality and bit rate similar to "generative" compression models such as HiFiC, while requiring less than 1% of the multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for decompression. We do this by optimizing C3, an overfitted image codec, for Wasserstein Distortion (WD), and evaluating the image reconstructions with a human rater study. The study also reveals that WD outperforms other perceptual quality metrics such as LPIPS, DISTS, and MS-SSIM, both as an optimization objective and as a predictor of human ratings, achieving over 94% Pearson correlation with Elo scores.</description>

Abstract: Space debris presents a critical challenge for the sustainability of future space missions, emphasizing the need for robust and standardized identification methods. However, a comprehensive benchmark for rocket body classification remains absent. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the RoBo6 dataset for rocket body classification based on light curves. The dataset, derived from the Mini Mega Tortora database, includes light curves for six rocket body classes: CZ-3B, Atlas 5 Centaur, Falcon 9, H-2A, Ariane 5, and Delta 4. With 5,676 training and 1,404 test samples, it addresses data inconsistencies using resampling, normalization, and filtering techniques. Several machine learning models were evaluated, including CNN and transformer-based approaches, with Astroconformer reporting the best performance. The dataset establishes a common benchmark for future comparisons and advancements in rocket body classification tasks.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dense Dispersed Structured Light for Hyperspectral 3D Imaging of Dynamic Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral 3D imaging captures both depth maps and hyperspectral images, enabling comprehensive geometric and material analysis. Recent methods achieve high spectral and depth accuracy; however, they require long acquisition times often over several minutes or rely on large, expensive systems, restricting their use to static scenes. We present Dense Dispersed Structured Light (DDSL), an accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging method for dynamic scenes that utilizes stereo RGB cameras and an RGB projector equipped with an affordable diffraction grating film. We design spectrally multiplexed DDSL patterns that significantly reduce the number of required projector patterns, thereby accelerating acquisition speed. Additionally, we formulate an image formation model and a reconstruction method to estimate a hyperspectral image and depth map from captured stereo images. As the first practical and accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging method for dynamic scenes, we experimentally demonstrate that DDSL achieves a spectral resolution of 15.5 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM), a depth error of 4 mm, and a frame rate of 6.6 fps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality degradation is observed in underwater images due to the effects of light refraction and absorption by water, leading to issues like color cast, haziness, and limited visibility. This degradation negatively affects the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles used in marine applications. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight phase-based transformer network with 1.77M parameters for underwater image restoration (UIR). Our approach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a phase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase attention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent attentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic (UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness for low-light image enhancement using the LOL dataset. Through extensive ablation studies and comparative analysis, it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

Abstract: Previous tone mapping methods mainly focus on how to enhance tones in low-resolution images and recover details using the high-frequent components extracted from the input image. These methods typically rely on traditional feature pyramids to artificially extract high-frequency components, such as Laplacian and Gaussian pyramids with handcrafted kernels. However, traditional handcrafted features struggle to effectively capture the high-frequency components in HDR images, resulting in excessive smoothing and loss of detail in the output image. To mitigate the above issue, we introduce a learnable Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet). Based on the learnable differential pyramid, our DPRNet can capture detailed textures and structures, which is crucial for high-quality tone mapping recovery. In addition, to achieve global consistency and local contrast harmonization, we design a global tone perception module and a local tone tuning module that ensure the consistency of global tuning and the accuracy of local tuning, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 2.58 dB in the HDR+ dataset and 3.31 dB in the HDRI Haven dataset respectively compared with the second-best method. Notably, our method exhibits the best generalization ability in the non-homologous image and video tone mapping operation.

      <title>TACO: Training-free Sound Prompted Segmentation via Deep Audio-visual CO-factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained audio and image models demonstrate an unprecedented degree of generalization, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Adaptive Lighting via Channel-Aware Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning lighting adaption is a key step in obtaining a good visual perception and supporting downstream vision tasks. There are multiple light-related tasks (e.g., image retouching and exposure correction) and previous studies have mainly investigated these tasks individually. However, we observe that the light-related tasks share fundamental properties: i) different color channels have different light properties, and ii) the channel differences reflected in the time and frequency domains are different. Based on the common light property guidance, we propose a Learning Adaptive Lighting Network (LALNet), a unified framework capable of processing different light-related tasks. Specifically, we introduce the color-separated features that emphasize the light difference of different color channels and combine them with the traditional color-mixed features by Light Guided Attention (LGA). The LGA utilizes color-separated features to guide color-mixed features focusing on channel differences and ensuring visual consistency across channels. We introduce dual domain channel modulation to generate color-separated features and a wavelet followed by a vision state space module to generate color-mixed features. Extensive experiments on four representative light-related tasks demonstrate that LALNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tests and requires fewer computational resources. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxx2025.github.io/LALNet/.</description>

      <title>RaD: A Metric for Medical Image Distribution Comparison in Out-of-Domain Detection and Other Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Regularization for Image-to-Image Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of quantifying uncertainty in deep networks has become paramount for reliable real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method to improve uncertainty estimation in medical Image-to-Image (I2I) translation. Our model integrates aleatoric uncertainty and employs Uncertainty-Aware Regularization (UAR) inspired by simple priors to refine uncertainty estimates and enhance reconstruction quality. We show that by leveraging simple priors on parameters, our approach captures more robust uncertainty maps, effectively refining them to indicate precisely where the network encounters difficulties, while being less affected by noise. Our experiments demonstrate that UAR not only improves translation performance, but also provides better uncertainty estimations, particularly in the presence of noise and artifacts. We validate our approach using two medical imaging datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in maintaining high confidence in familiar regions while accurately identifying areas of uncertainty in novel/ambiguous scenarios.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging -- A Mini Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing digitization of medical imaging enables machine learning based improvements in detecting, visualizing and segmenting lesions, easing the workload for medical experts. However, supervised machine learning requires reliable labelled data, which is is often difficult or impossible to collect or at least time consuming and thereby costly. Therefore methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised) or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodology that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classification and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Multi-Scale Multiple Instance Learning to Improve Thyroid Cancer Classification</title>

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is currently the fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women. Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores. This provides motivation for analysis and discussion of the individual approaches.</description>

Abstract: With the spread of COVID-19 around the globe over the past year, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and image processing methods to analyze the X-ray images of patients' chest with COVID-19 has become essential. The COVID-19 virus recognition in the lung area of a patient is one of the basic and essential needs of clicical centers and hospitals. Most research in this field has been devoted to papers on the basis of deep learning methods utilizing CNNs (Convolutional Neural Network), which mainly deal with the screening of sick and healthy people.In this study, a new structure of a 19-layer CNN has been recommended for accurately recognition of the COVID-19 from the X-ray pictures of chest. The offered CNN is developed to serve as a precise diagnosis system for a three class (viral pneumonia, Normal, COVID) and a four classclassification (Lung opacity, Normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia). A comparison is conducted among the outcomes of the offered procedure and some popular pretrained networks, including Inception, Alexnet, ResNet50, Squeezenet, and VGG19 and based on Specificity, Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Confusion Matrix, and F1-score. The experimental results of the offered CNN method specify its dominance over the existing published procedures. This method can be a useful tool for clinicians in deciding properly about COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Learning To Improve Semantic Segmentation Of CBCT Scans Using Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in medical image processing, essential for segmenting organs or lesions such as tumors. In this study we aim to improve automated segmentation in CBCTs through multi-task learning. To evaluate effects on different volume qualities, a CBCT dataset is synthesised from the CT Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS) dataset. To improve segmentation, two approaches are investigated. First, we perform multi-task learning to add morphology based regularization through a volume reconstruction task. Second, we use this reconstruction task to reconstruct the best quality CBCT (most similar to the original CT), facilitating denoising effects. We explore both holistic and patch-based approaches. Our findings reveal that, especially using a patch-based approach, multi-task learning improves segmentation in most cases and that these results can further be improved by our denoising approach.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found at: https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/AnatCL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large models have achieved significant progress in computer vision, challenges such as optimization complexity, the intricacy of transformer architectures, computational constraints, and practical application demands highlight the importance of simpler model designs in medical image segmentation. This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules. LV-UNet employs an enhanced deep training strategy and switches to a deployment mode during inference by re-parametrization, significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead. Experimental results on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets demonstrate a better trade-off between performance and the computational load. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/juntaoJianggavin/LV-UNet}.</description>

      <title>Moner: Motion Correction in Undersampled Radial MRI with Unsupervised Neural Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion correction (MoCo) in radial MRI is a challenging problem due to the unpredictability of subject's motion. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MoCo algorithms often use extensive high-quality MR images to pre-train neural networks, obtaining excellent reconstructions. However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly solves artifact-free MR images and accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, enabling ideal solutions. Specifically, we incorporate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Approach for Brain MR Image Synthesis: 2D Image Synthesis and 3D Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automatic brain tumor segmentation methods, their performance is not guaranteed when certain MR sequences are missing. Addressing this issue, it is crucial to synthesize the missing MR images that reflect the unique characteristics of the absent modality with precise tumor representation. Typically, MRI synthesis methods generate partial images rather than full-sized volumes due to computational constraints. This limitation can lead to a lack of comprehensive 3D volumetric information and result in image artifacts during the merging process. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach that first synthesizes MR images from 2D slices using a novel intensity encoding method and then refines the synthesized MRI. The proposed intensity encoding reduces artifacts when synthesizing MRI on a 2D slice basis. Then, the \textit{Refiner}, which leverages complete 3D volume information, further improves the quality of the synthesized images and enhances their applicability to segmentation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the intensity encoding effectively minimizes artifacts in the synthesized MRI and improves perceptual quality. Furthermore, using the \textit{Refiner} on synthesized MRI significantly improves brain tumor segmentation results, highlighting the potential of our approach in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise: Self-Supervised Medical Image Denoising from Single Noisy Image Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning technologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these methods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which greatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to train denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing self-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based methods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images. Therefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and practical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance using only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise (NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy image volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising network using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and inter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume obtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising of the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both denoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N operates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues such as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical practices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the automatic segmentation and analysis of 3D liver vasculature models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>HAAT: Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

      <title>Differentiable Voxel-based X-ray Rendering Improves Sparse-View 3D CBCT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DiffVox, a self-supervised framework for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction by directly optimizing a voxelgrid representation using physics-based differentiable X-ray rendering. Further, we investigate how the different implementations of the X-ray image formation model in the renderer affect the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. When combined with our regularized voxel-based learning framework, we find that using an exact implementation of the discrete Beer-Lambert law for X-ray attenuation in the renderer outperforms both widely used iterative CBCT reconstruction algorithms and modern neural field approaches, particularly when given only a few input views. As a result, we reconstruct high-fidelity 3D CBCT volumes from fewer X-rays, potentially reducing ionizing radiation exposure and improving diagnostic utility. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/hossein-momeni/DiffVox.</description>

      <title>Cross-Subject Domain Adaptation for Classifying Working Memory Load with Multi-Frame EEG Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06769v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working memory (WM), denoting the information temporally stored in the mind, is a fundamental research topic in the field of human cognition. Electroencephalograph (EEG), which can monitor the electrical activity of the brain, has been widely used in measuring the level of WM. However, one of the critical challenges is that individual differences may cause ineffective results, especially when the established model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a cross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to generalize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform EEG time series into multi-frame EEG images incorporating spatial, spectral, and temporal information. First, the Subject-Shared module in CS-DASA receives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and learns the common feature representations. Then, in the subject-specific module, the maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution divergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective penalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject spatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the discriminative spatial features from the target image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG dataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of achieving better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Potential Field Based Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in transformers, specifically self-attention mechanisms, have significantly improved hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, these models often suffer from inefficiencies, as their computational complexity scales quadratically with sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose the morphological spatial mamba (SMM) and morphological spatial-spectral Mamba (SSMM) model (MorpMamba), which combines the strengths of morphological operations and the state space model framework, offering a more computationally efficient alternative to transformers. In MorpMamba, a novel token generation module first converts HSI patches into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed through morphological operations such as erosion and dilation, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions to capture structural and shape information. A token enhancement module refines these features by dynamically adjusting the spatial and spectral tokens based on central HSI regions, ensuring effective feature fusion within each block. Subsequently, multi-head self-attention is applied to further enrich the feature representations, allowing the model to capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data. Finally, the enhanced tokens are fed into a state space module, which efficiently models the temporal evolution of the features for classification. Experimental results on widely used HSI datasets demonstrate that MorpMamba achieves superior parametric efficiency compared to traditional CNN and transformer models while maintaining high accuracy. The code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/mahmad000/MorpMamba}.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Medical Image Generation Based on Pyramid Convolutional Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of multimodal medical imaging can provide complementary and comprehensive information for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in clinical practice, since positron emission tomography (PET) is often missing, multimodal images might be incomplete. To address this problem, we propose a method that can efficiently utilize structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) image information to generate high-quality PET images. Our generation model efficiently utilizes pyramid convolution combined with channel attention mechanism to extract multi-scale local features in sMRI, and injects global correlation information into these features using self-attention mechanism to ensure the restoration of the generated PET image on local texture and global structure. Additionally, we introduce additional loss functions to guide the generation model in producing higher-quality PET images. Through experiments conducted on publicly available ADNI databases, the generated images outperform previous research methods in various performance indicators (average absolute error: 0.0194, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 29.65, structural similarity: 0.9486) and are close to real images. In promoting AD diagnosis, the generated images combined with their corresponding sMRI also showed excellent performance in AD diagnosis tasks (classification accuracy: 94.21 %), and outperformed previous research methods of the same type. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods in quantitative metrics, qualitative visualization, and evaluation criteria.</description>
