      <title>Computable presentations of randomizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the effective metric structure theory of Keisler randomizations. We show that a classical countable structure $\mathcal{M}$ has a decidable presentation if and only if its Borel randomization $\mathcal{M}^{[0,1)}$ has a computable presentation for which the constant functions are uniformly computable points. We determine a sufficient condition for which the uniform computability of the constant functions can be dropped. We show that when $\mathcal{M}$ is effectively $\omega$-categorical, then $\mathcal{M}^{[0,1)}$ is computably categorical, that is, has a unique computable presentation up to computable isomorphism. A special case of this result is that the unique separable atomless probability algebra is computably categorical. Finally, we show that all randomizations admit effective quantifier elimination.</description>

      <title>Swap Kripke models for deontic LFIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of nondeterministic semantics for some deontic logics based on the class of paraconsistent logics known as Logics of Formal Inconsistency (LFIs), for the first time combining swap structures and Kripke models through the novel notion of swap Kripe models. We start by making use of Nmatrices to characterize systems based on LFIs that do not satisfy axiom (cl), while turning to RNmatrices when the latter is considered in the underlying LFIs. This paper also presents, for the first time, a full axiomatization and a semantics for the $C^{D}_n$ hierarchy, by use of the aforementioned mixed semantics with RNmatrices. This includes the historical system $C^{D}_1$ of da Costa-Carnielli (1986), the first deontic paraconsistent system proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dependent measures in independent theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of dependence, as a property of a Keisler measure, and generalize several results of [HPS13] on generically stable measures (in $NIP$ theories) to arbitrary theories. Among other things, we show that this notion is very natural and fundamental for several reasons: (i) all measures in $NIP$ theories are dependent, (ii) all types and all $fim$ measures in any theory are dependent, and (iii) as a crucial result in measure theory, the Glivenko-Cantelli class of functions (formulas) is characterized by dependent measures.</description>

      <title>On the representation of C-recursive integer sequences by arithmetic terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, if an integer sequence is given by a linear recurrence of constant rational coefficients, then it can be represented as the difference of two arithmetic terms with exponentiation, which do not contain any irrational constant. We apply our methods to various Lucas sequences including the classical Fibonacci sequence, to the sequence of solutions of the Pell equation and to some natural C-recursive sequences of degree 3.</description>

      <title>Did Turing prove the undecidability of the halting problem?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the accuracy of the attribution commonly given to Turing's 1936 paper "On computable numbers..." for the computable undecidability of the halting problem, coming eventually to a nuanced conclusion.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-like theorems for the Schreier barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of finite subsets $s$ of the natural numbers such that $|s|=1+\min s$ is known as the Schreier barrier in combinatorics and Banach Space theory, and as the family of exactly $\omega$-large sets in Logic. We formulate and prove the generalizations of Friedman's Free Set and Thin Set theorems and of Rainbow Ramsey's theorem to colorings of the Schreier barrier. We analyze the strength of these theorems from the point of view of Computability Theory and Reverse Mathematics. Surprisingly, the exactly $\omega$-large counterparts of the Thin Set and Free Set theorems can code $\emptyset^{(\omega)}$, while the exactly $\omega$-large Rainbow Ramsey theorem does not code the halting set.</description>

      <title>On the abstract elementary class of acts with embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of acts with embeddings as an abstract elementary class. We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both.</description>

      <title>Finitely (In)tractable Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) is a generalization of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) that includes approximation variants of satisfiability and graph coloring problems. Barto [LICS '19] has shown that a specific PCSP, the problem to find a valid Not-All-Equal solution to a 1-in-3-SAT instance, is not finitely tractable in that it can be solved by a trivial reduction to a tractable CSP, but such a CSP is necessarily over an infinite domain (unless P=NP). We initiate a systematic study of this phenomenon by giving a general necessary condition for finite tractability and characterizing finite tractability within a class of templates - the "basic" tractable cases in the dichotomy theorem for symmetric Boolean PCSPs allowing negations by Brakensiek and Guruswami [SODA'18].</description>
