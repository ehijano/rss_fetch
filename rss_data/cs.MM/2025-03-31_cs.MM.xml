      <title>Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.</description>

      <title>Unicorn: Text-Only Data Synthesis for Vision Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) typically requires large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs, but collecting or synthesizing such data is costly. In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

      <title>Multi-modal Speech Transformer Decoders: When Do Multiple Modalities Improve Accuracy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only discrete-token language models have recently achieved significant success in automatic speech recognition. However, systematic analyses of how different modalities impact performance in specific scenarios remain limited. In this paper, we investigate the effects of multiple modalities on recognition accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments suggest that: (1) Integrating more modalities can increase accuracy; in particular, our paper is, to our best knowledge, the first to show the benefit of combining audio, image context, and lip information; (2) Images as a supplementary modality for speech recognition provide the greatest benefit at moderate noise levels, moreover, they exhibit a different trend compared to inherently synchronized modalities like lip movements; (3) Performance improves on both synthetic and real-world datasets when the most relevant visual information is filtered as a preprocessing step.</description>

      <title>RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition. The code, data and models are available at https://hoar012.github.io/RAP-Project/.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Bridger: Towards Training-free Missing Multi-modality Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</description>
