      <title>Laterally Excited Bulk Acoustic Wave (LBAW) X-Cut Lithium Niobate Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Laterally excited Bulk Acoustic Wave (LBAW) resonators on X-cut Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) and, for the first time their higher-order overtones (LOBAW) are demonstrated by embedding interdigitated electrodes recessed into the piezoelectric thin film, allowing to exploit both S0 and SH0 vibrational modes. This recessed electrode architecture decouples the dispersion relation from film thickness, enabling lithographic tuning of resonance frequency and on-chip multi-frequency scaling on a single substrate, while concurrently increasing static capacitance density (C0) and reducing ohmic losses (Rs). The excited SH0 modes exhibits Figures of Merit (FoM) of 437 at 673 MHz for the fundamental tone and 53 at 1.05 GHz for the overtone. The proposed architecture holds large potential for future 5G/6G advanced radio frequency front-end modules, enabling on-chip multi-frequency scaling and improved performance.</description>

      <title>Distribution System State and Impedance Estimation Augmented with Carson's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.</description>

      <title>En Route Path-planning for Partially Occupied Vehicles in Ride-pooling Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-pooling services, such as UberPool and Lyft Shared Saver, enable a single vehicle to serve multiple customers within one shared trip. Efficient path-planning algorithms are crucial for improving the performance of such systems. For partially occupied vehicles with available capacity, we introduce a novel routing algorithm designed to maximize the likelihood of picking up additional passengers while serving the current passengers to their destination. Unlike traditional methods that group passengers and vehicles based on predefined time windows, our algorithm allows for immediate responses to passenger requests. Our approach optimizes travel time while dynamically considering passenger demand and coordinating with other vehicles. Formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, our method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance service quality.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Interoperability in Residential Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, batteries and electric vehicles become increasingly prevalent at the edge, maintaining grid stability requires advanced monitoring and control mechanisms. This paper presents a scalable smart grid gateway architecture that enables interoperability between Modbus-based inverters and IEEE 2030.5 cloud-based control systems. The proposed solution leverages Azure cloud services and edge-computing gateway devices to support dynamic configuration, telemetry ingestion, remote control and Volt-VAR Curve deployment. A microservice-based architecture ensures flexibility and scalability across diverse deployment scenarios, including both gateway-mediated and direct-to-cloud device communication. Results demonstrate the successful mapping of a Fronius Primo inverter's Modbus registers to IEEE 2030.5-compliant telemetry and control functions. Additionally, we evaluate real-time VVC updates and their impact on local voltage regulation, showcasing dynamic cloud-to-edge control with minimal latency. This work highlights the potential of virtualised, standards-based control infrastructures to support DER integration and active grid participation, while remaining adaptable to evolving smart grid architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Experience Paper: Scaling WiFi Sensing to Millions of Commodity Devices for Ubiquitous Home Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Olfactory Inertial Odometry: Sensor Calibration and Drift Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types. Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.</description>

      <title>Real-Time LPV-Based Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Robust Trajectory Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for trajectory tracking in autonomous vehicles under diverse driving conditions. The proposed approach incorporates a modular architecture that integrates state estimation, vehicle dynamics modeling, and optimization to ensure real-time performance. The state-space equations are formulated in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form, and a curvature-based tuning method is introduced to optimize weight matrices for varying trajectories. The MPC framework is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) for parallel execution of state estimation and control optimization, ensuring scalability and minimal latency. Extensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted on multiple predefined trajectories, demonstrating high accuracy with minimal cross-track and orientation errors, even under aggressive maneuvers and high-speed conditions. The results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed system, achieving seamless alignment between simulated and real-world performance. This work lays the foundation for dynamic weight tuning and integration into cooperative autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Optimization for Improved Flexibility Aggregation Models of Electric Vehicle Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are expected to become an increasingly important source of flexibility for power system operations. However, accurately capturing the flexibility potential of numerous and heterogeneous EVs remains a significant challenge. We propose a bilevel optimization formulation to enhance flexibility aggregations of electric vehicle fleets. The outer level minimizes scheduling deviations between the aggregated and reference EV units, while the inner level maximizes the aggregated unit's profits. Our approach introduces hourly to daily scaling factor mappings to parameterize the aggregated EV units. Compared to simple aggregation methods, the proposed framework reduces the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more accurate flexibility representations. The proposed framework also provides a foundation for several potential extensions in future work.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of robust diffusive stability (RDS) for a pair of Schur-stable nonnegative matrices. Specifically, we show that the existence of a common diagonal Lyapunov function is sufficient for RDS and highlight how this condition differs from recently published results based on linear copositive Lyapunov functions. We also present two results on RDS for extended Leslie matrices arising in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AIoT workloads demand energy-efficient orchestration across cloud-edge infrastructures, but Kubernetes' default scheduler lacks multi-criteria optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler, particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision. Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Intent-Based Industrial Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities, enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm, originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction (HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing, the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust finite-time feedback controller introduced for the second-order systems in [1] can be seen as a non-overshooting quasi-continuous sliding mode control. The paper proposes a regularization scheme to suppress inherent chattering due to discontinuity of the control [1] in the origin, in favor of practical applications. A detailed analysis with ISS and iISS proofs are provided along with supporting numerical results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Informed Parameter Selection for Improved Soil Moisture Estimation from Remote Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimation is required for advancing irrigation scheduling and water conservation efforts. Central to this task are soil hydraulic parameters, which govern moisture dynamics but are rarely known precisely and must therefore be inferred from observational data. In large-scale agricultural fields, estimating the complete set of these parameters is often impractical due to the sparse and noisy nature of available measurements. To address this challenge, this work develops a framework that uses sensitivity analysis and orthogonal projection to identify parameters that are both reliably estimable from available data. These parameters, together with the spatial distribution of soil moisture, are jointly estimated by assimilating observational data into a cylindrical-coordinate version of the Richards equation using an extended Kalman filter. The soil moisture measurements are obtained from microwave remote sensors mounted on center pivot irrigation systems - an emerging and practical technology for capturing field-scale variability. Numerical simulations and field experiments conducted on a large-scale site in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, demonstrate that the proposed method improves soil moisture estimation accuracy by 24-43% and enhances predictive model performance by 50%. Furthermore, the estimated parameters - particularly saturated hydraulic conductivity - exhibit good agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Seaweed Growth on Autonomous Farms: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Underactuated Systems Navigating on Uncertain Ocean Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seaweed biomass presents a substantial opportunity for climate mitigation, yet to realize its potential, farming must be expanded to the vast open oceans. However, in the open ocean neither anchored farming nor floating farms with powerful engines are economically viable. Thus, a potential solution are farms that operate by going with the flow, utilizing minimal propulsion to strategically leverage beneficial ocean currents. In this work, we focus on low-power autonomous seaweed farms and design controllers that maximize seaweed growth by taking advantage of ocean currents. We first introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation to solve for the growth-optimal value function when the true currents are known. However, in reality only short-term imperfect forecasts with increasing uncertainty are available. Hence, we present three additional extensions. Firstly, we use frequent replanning to mitigate forecast errors. Second, to optimize for long-term growth, we extend the value function beyond the forecast horizon by estimating the expected future growth based on seasonal average currents. Lastly, we introduce a discounted finite-time DP formulation to account for the increasing uncertainty in future ocean current estimates. We empirically evaluate our approach with 30-day simulations of farms in realistic ocean conditions. Our method achieves 95.8\% of the best possible growth using only 5-day forecasts.This demonstrates that low-power propulsion is a promising method to operate autonomous seaweed farms in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Sample-based nonlinear detectability for discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two sample-based formulations of incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), a suitable detectability notion for general nonlinear systems. In this work we consider the case of limited output information, i.e., measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. The output-dependent term of the sample-based i-IOSS bound is properly modified to yield a characterization for detectability in presence of incomplete output sequences. We provide both a non-timediscounted and a time-discounted formulation of samplebased i-IOSS. Furthermore, conditions for an i-IOSS system to be also sample-based i-IOSS are given and the relation between the two formulations of sample-based i-IOSS is shown.</description>

      <title>Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic model predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state to minimize a deterministic quadratic cost and satisfy tightened constraints. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear continuously differentiable systems using stochastic contraction metrics and an assumed bound on the covariance matrices. Numerical simulations highlight the computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control with closed-loop guarantees for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an event-triggered moving horizon estimation (ET-MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems. The key components of the proposed scheme are a novel event-triggering mechanism (ETM) and the suitable design of the MHE cost function. The main characteristic of our method is that the MHE's nonlinear optimization problem is only solved when the ETM triggers the transmission of measured data to the remote state estimator. If no event occurs, then the current state estimate results from an open-loop prediction using the system dynamics. Furthermore, we show robust global exponential stability of the ET-MHE under a suitable detectability condition. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed method in terms of a nonlinear benchmark example, where we achieved similar estimation performance compared to standard MHE using 86% less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Control for System Availability and Continuous Operation in Heavy-Duty Wheeled Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the control system in a heavy-duty wheeled mobile robot (HD-WMR) malfunctions, deviations from ideal motion occur, significantly heightening the risks of off-road instability and costly damage. To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated. Subsequently, the MFHCA framework is proposed to manage all wheels under various fault modes, ensuring that each wheel tracks the reference driving velocities and steering angles, which are inverse kinematically mapped from the angular and linear velocities commanded in the HD-WMR's base frame. To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability. The experimental analysis of a 6,500-kg hydraulic-powered HD-WMR under various fault modes and rough terrains demonstrates the validity of the MFHCA framework.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Beta HMM: Hidden Markov Model Filtering with Equal Exit Probabilities and a Step-Size Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a powerful framework for inference in time-varying environments, where the underlying state evolves according to a Markov chain. To address the optimal filtering problem in general dynamic settings, we propose the $\alpha\beta$-HMM algorithm, which simplifies the state transition model to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities and introduces a step-size parameter to balance the influence of observational data and the model. By analyzing the algorithm's dynamics in stationary environments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off between inference accuracy and adaptation capability, highlighting how key parameters and observation quality impact performance. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamical system governing the evolution of the log-belief ratio, along with supporting numerical experiments, demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptability and inference performance in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Software Defined Battery Systems for Transformer Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential electric vehicle charging causes large spikes in electricity demand that risk violating neighborhood transformer power limits. Battery energy storage systems reduce these transformer limit violations, but operating them individually is not cost-optimal. Instead of individual optimization, aggregating, or sharing, these batteries leads to cost-optimal performance, but homeowners must relinquish battery control. This paper leverages virtualization to propose battery sharing optimization schemes to reduce electricity costs, extend the lifetime of a residential transformer, and maintain homeowner control over the battery. A case study with simulated home loads, solar generation, and electric vehicle charging profiles demonstrates that joint, or shared, optimization reduces consumer bills by 56% and transformer aging by 48% compared to individual optimization. Hybrid and dynamic optimization schemes that provide owners with autonomy have similar transformer aging reduction but are slightly less cost-effective. These results suggest that controlling shared batteries with virtualization is an effective way to delay transformer upgrades in the face of growing residential electric vehicle charging penetration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches for designing analog circuits are time-consuming and require significant human expertise. Existing automation efforts using methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.</description>

      <title>An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware. The entire design is an open source project and was developed using free software.</description>

      <title>Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured environments. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</description>
