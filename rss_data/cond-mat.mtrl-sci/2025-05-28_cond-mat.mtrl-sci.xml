      <title>Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 \AA) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Highly Enhanced robust room temperature ferromagnetism in CVD-grown nano-dimensional MoS2 flakes by modifying edges and defect engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alterations in the magnetic properties and electronic structure of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown nano-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) after low energy ion irradiation are thoroughly investigated. The formation of pure hexagonal 2-H phase has been identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The pristine samples are irradiated by Argon (Ar) ions with low energy at different fluences. A comprehensive analysis of Raman spectroscopy data manifests the formation of lattice defects like S-vacancies across the samples after irradiation. Triangular-flake formation in the pristine sample is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. After increasing irradiation fluences the big flakes commenced to fragment into smaller ones enhancing the number of edge-terminated structures. The electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) analysis verifies the absence of any magnetic impurity. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirm the formation of S-vacancies after irradiation. The pristine sample exhibits diamagnetic behavior at room temperature. The saturation magnetization value increases with increasing the ion irradiation fluences, and the sample irradiated with 1e15 ions/cm2 demonstrates the highest magnetization value of 4.18 emu/g. The impact of edge-terminated structure and point defects like S-vacancies to induce room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is thoroughly examined.</description>

      <title>Ferroelastic Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast atomic dimerization of Peierls distortion in semimetal molybdenum ditelluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semimetal molybdenum ditelluride (1T'-MoTe$_2$) possess diverse phase transitions enriching its application prospects. The structural response during these transitions is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanisms, but the desired details of pathway and time span are still insufficient. Here, we investigate the lattice evolution in few-layer 1T'-MoTe$_2$ after photoexcitation, using ultrafast electron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed complex lattice responses with unintuitively evolving Bragg peak intensity and interplanar spacing, are best interpreted as the combination of shear displacement and Mo-Mo bond shortening in a few picoseconds, and a metastable structure in nanoseconds, basing on the analyses of structure factor and pair distribution function. The DFT calculations reveal that, the photodoped electrons induced population change of the antibonding states close to Fermi level, lead to the shear displacement and the dimerization of Mo pairs. Our findings present new insights for elucidating the picture of Peierls distortion in 1T'-MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance of wafer-scale hexagonal boron nitride thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalised magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30uT/sqrt(Hz um^3). We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800-900C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic and experimental study of microstructural evolution in nanocrystalline iron subjected to irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocrystalline materials have been proposed for use in future fusion reactors due to their high grain boundary density that may act as a sink for irradiation-induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to model collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare the damage evolution to that observed in initially perfect, single crystalline iron. The nanocrystalline material is generated either by Voronoi tessellation or severe plastic shearing. Upon irradiation, the grains in nanocrystalline simulations coarsen, with all ultimately becoming single crystalline above 2 dpa. Above a damage dose of 1 dpa, nanocrystalline cells show a lower dislocation density and lower lattice swelling than their initially pristine counterparts. Experimental X-ray diffraction data is collected on nanocrystalline iron samples subjected to self-ion irradiation. Line profile analysis data agrees with the trends observed in the atomistic simulations, revealing the presence of an irradiation induced annealing process, with a clear reduction in micro-strain with increasing dose. We attempt to determine why some grains in our atomistic simulations grow, while others shrink, by creating a Toy Model that simulates volume exchange between grains based on different hypothesised exchange mechanisms. This suggests that irradiation-induced grain growth is consistent with random growth.</description>

      <title>Large strain contribution to the laser-driven magnetization response of magnetostrictive TbFe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.</description>

      <title>Charge Carrier Mobilities in gamma-Graphynes: A computational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphynes, a class of two-dimensional carbon allotropes, exhibit exceptional electronic properties, similar to graphene, but with intrinsic band gaps, making them promising for semiconducting applications. The incorporation of acetylene linkages allows for systematic modulation of their properties. However, the theoretical characterization of graphynes remains computationally demanding, particularly for electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analyses. Here, we employ the density functional tight binding method within the DFTBephy framework, providing an efficient and accurate approach for computing EPC and transport properties. We investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic, and transport properties of graphynes, comparing transport calculations using the constant relaxation-time approximation and the self-energy relaxation-time approximation (SERTA) alongside analytical models based on parabolic- and Kane-band approximations. For graphyne, the SERTA relaxation time is 0.63 (1.69) ps for holes (electrons). In graphdiyne, the relaxation time is 0.04 (0.14) ps for holes (electrons). While the hole mobilities in graphyne are on the order of 10$^3$ cm$^2/$Vs, the electron mobilities reach up to 10$^4$ cm$^2/$Vs. In graphdiyne, the mobility values for both types of charge carriers are on the order of 10$^2$ cm$^2/$Vs. The phonon-limited mobilities at room temperature in graphyne fall between those of graphene and MoS$_2$, while in graphdiyne, they are comparable to those of MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>From Polyhedra to Crystals: A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Crystal Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structures can be viewed as assemblies of space-filling polyhedra, which play a critical role in determining material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional crystal structure prediction methods rely on random structure generation and do not explicitly incorporate polyhedral tiling, limiting their efficiency and interpretability. In this highlight, we introduced a novel crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedral information. The geometry and topology of space-filling polyhedra are encoded as a dual periodic graph, and the corresponding crystal structure is obtained via the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures from their dual periodic graphs. This method offers a new pathway for systematically generating crystal structures based on target polyhedra, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel materials for applications in electronics, energy storage, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Strain controlled g- to d-wave transition in altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of a strain-induced transformation from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism was recently recently proposed for MnTe using a $k\cdot p$ perturbative model. In this work, we demonstrate such a transition in CrSb for a wider array of strains, using a combination of a minimal model and first-principles calculations. Starting from a symmetry perspective, we analyze the spin elastoconductivity tensor, and determine the strain types which allow for a change in the altermagnetic symmetry. We obtain three strain directions, which allow for a $d$-wave type splitting, and one in which a net magnetic moment emerges. Using first-principles calculations in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we confirm these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, these results do not alter qualitatively in the presence of SOC. Finally, we reveal that the resulting spin currents give rise to a spin-splitter effect of up to 5\% under realistic strains of 1\%, confirming strain as a powerful tool for tuning altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learned predictions of adsorption energies at the metal--oxide interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ to value-added compounds is an important part of the effort to store and reuse atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions. Here we focus on $\mathrm{CO_2}$ hydrogenation over so-called inverse catalysts: transition metal oxide clusters supported on metal surfaces. The conventional approach for computational screening of such candidate catalyst materials involves a reliance on density functional theory (DFT) to obtain accurate adsorption energies at a significant computational cost. Here we present a machine learning (ML)-accelerated workflow for obtaining adsorption energies at the metal--oxide interface. We enumerate possible binding sites at the clusters and use DFT to sample a subset of these with diverse local adsorbate environments. The data set is used to explore interpretable and black-box ML models with the aim to reveal the electronic and structural factors controlling adsorption at metal--oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the explored ML models can be used for low-cost prediction of adsorption energies on structures outside of the original training data set. The workflow presented here, along with the insights into trends in adsorption energies at metal--oxide interfaces, will be useful for identifying active sites, predicting parameters required for microkinetic modeling of reactions on complex catalyst materials, and accelerating data-driven catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Degradation and SEI Evolution in Alloy Anodes Revealed by Correlative Liquid-Cell Electrochemistry and Cryogenic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding solid liquid interfaces at high spatial and chemical resolution is crucial for advancing electrochemical energy storage technologies, yet this remains a persistent challenge due to the lack of characterisation techniques that can capture dynamic processes and preserve fragile interfacial chemistries. In lithium ion batteries, interfacial phenomena such as lithium alloying, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and electrode degradation play a decisive role in capacity retention and failure mechanisms but are difficult to observe in their native state due to high mobility, reactivity, and low atomic number of lithium. Here, we use a recently introduced correlative operando characterisation approach that integrates electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy with cryogenic atom probe tomography to resolve the evolution of a platinum alloy anode at the solid liquid interface during electrochemical cycling. This correlative, cryo enabled workflow reveals spatially heterogeneous SEI formation, the presence of lithium carbonate rich inner SEI layers, and the retention of elemental lithium within the platinum electrode, most likely trapped along grain boundaries. Additionally, we observe the formation of mossy lithium structures and irreversible lithium loss through dead lithium accumulation. Our results provide direct mechanistic insight into lithium alloying and degradation pathways in alloy based anodes and establish a generalised platform for probing dynamic electrochemical interfaces with complementary structural and chemical sensitivity. The methodology is broadly applicable to next generation electrode materials and electrochemical devices where interfacial dynamics dictate performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Tuning Ultra-Narrow Direct Bandgap in alpha-Sn Nanocrystals: A CMOS-Compatible Approach for THz Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: alpha-Sn has recently been attracting significant interest due to its unique electronic properties. However, this allotrope of Sn is stable only below 13 {\deg}C and alternative options to the conventional stabilization by epitaxial growth on InSb are still a challenge. In this work, nanoparticles with inner alpha-Sn nanocrystals were synthesized on a Silicon substrate via a CMOS-compatible process through microwave irradiation. The nanoparticle morphology was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy, demonstrating the ability to control the nanoparticle size by a dewetting process combined with a coalescence process induced by the microwaves. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction analyses confirmed the stabilization of the alpha-Sn phase within a SnO2 shell, while X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy measurements revealed the presence of a bandgap. Infrared transmission spectroscopy combined with a Tauc-plot extrapolation led to an estimate of the gap in the range from 64 to 137 meV range. Furthermore, the possibility to tune the bandgap by controlling the nanoparticle size, possibly leveraging weak quantum confinement effects, was demonstrated, unveiling the potential of alpha-Sn nanoparticles on Si for the development of CMOS-compatible THz devices.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to ${S = 3/2, I = 7/2}$, ${S = 1, I = 7/2}$, and ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.</description>

      <title>Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.</description>

      <title>A Python workflow definition for computational materials design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) have been developed in the field of computational materials science with different workflow formats, hindering interoperability and reproducibility of workflows in the field. To address this challenge, we introduce here the Python Workflow Definition (PWD) as a workflow exchange format to share workflows between Python-based WfMS, currently AiiDA, jobflow, and pyiron. This development is motivated by the similarity of these three Python-based WfMS, that represent the different workflow steps and data transferred between them as nodes and edges in a graph. With the PWD, we aim at fostering the interoperability and reproducibility between the different WfMS in the context of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) workflows. To separate the scientific from the technical complexity, the PWD consists of three components: (1) a conda environment that specifies the software dependencies, (2) a Python module that contains the Python functions represented as nodes in the workflow graph, and (3) a workflow graph stored in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The first version of the PWD supports directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based workflows. Thus, any DAG-based workflow defined in one of the three WfMS can be exported to the PWD and afterwards imported from the PWD to one of the other WfMS. After the import, the input parameters of the workflow can be adjusted and computing resources can be assigned to the workflow, before it is executed with the selected WfMS. This import from and export to the PWD is enabled by the PWD Python library that implements the PWD in AiiDA, jobflow, and pyiron.</description>

      <title>In situ photoemission study of collective electronic phase transition in VO2-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI phase to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics of local charge order in a THz-induced metastable state of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Defects and acceptor removal in 60Co {\gamma}-irradiated p-type silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron-doped silicon detectors used in high radiation environments like the future HL-LHC show a degradation in device performance due to the radiation induced deactivation of the active boron dopant. This effect, known as the so-called Acceptor Removal Effect (ARE), depends on particle type, particle energy and radiation dose and is usually explained by the formation of boroninterstitial - oxygen-interstitial (BiOi) defects that induce a donor-type defect level in the upper part of the Si band gap. Here we present defect characterization studies using Thermally Stimulated Current technique (TSC) and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) on a set of epitaxially grown p-type silicon diodes of different resistivity, irradiated with 60Co {\gamma}-rays. We used the defect parameters (activation energy, charge carrier capture cross sections and defect concentration) obtained from DLTS experiments for modeling the corresponding TSC spectra, and subsequently compared those with the experimental TSC results. This approach shows that the di-vacancy which is well characterized by DLTS correlates with the so-far unspecified charge emission signal of the X-defect that partially overlaps with the BiOi peak in TSC spectra. Additionally, in order to evaluate the impact of BiOi defect formation on the macroscopic properties of the device, we compared the BiOi defect concentration with the change in the effective carrier concentration Neff obtained from C-V measurements. It shows that the variations in Neff are about twice the changes in the BiOi concentration, which is in perfect consistency with the assumption of boron deactivation by the formation of the BiOi donor in irradiated p-type Si.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Data for More Efficient and Generalizable Learning: A Case Study in Disordered Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Low-energy, ultrafast spin reorientation at competing hybrid interfaces with tunable operating temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment of elements. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to change the information rewrite the storage by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, we demonstrate a spin reorientation transition in molecular interfaces of high magnetisation 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in-plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 to 1.9 nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 10^5 A per cm2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12 mJ per cm2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered twisted bilayer superconductors have suffered from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>X-ray Absorption Linear Dichroism at the Ti K-edge of TiO2 anatase single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.03301v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) exhibits a strong X-ray absorption linear dichroism with the X-ray incidence angle in the pre-edge, the XANES and the EXAFS at the titanium K-edge. In the pre-edge region the behaviour of the A1-A3 and B peaks, originating from the 1s-3d transitions, is due to the strong $p$-orbital polarization and strong $p-d$ orbital mixing. An unambiguous assignment of the pre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the support of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor analysis in quantitative agreement with the experiment. It is found that A1 is mostly an on-site 3d-4p hybridized transition, while peaks A3 and B are non-local transitions, with A3 being mostly dipolar and influence by the 3d-4p intersite hybridization, while B is due to interactions at longer range. Finally, peak A2 which was previously assigned to a transition involving pentacoordinated titanium atoms exhibits a quadrupolar angular evolution with incidence angle. These results pave the way to the use of the pre-edge peaks at the K-edge of a-TiO2 to characterize the electronic structure of related materials and in the field of ultrafast XAS where the linear dichroism can be used to compare the photophysics along different axes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve collective phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of collective phonon-ion modes to Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes can lead to a three order of magnitude increase in the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of single vibrational modes in the lattice associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving the TiO6 rocking via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the normalized impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons that are associated with heating. These findings provide new insights into phonon-coupled ion migration mechanisms and material design rules for ion conductors and opto-ionic materials.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate the electronic structure and lattice stability of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic phases, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase is metallic. Analyzing partial density of states has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty as well as being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies for either phase, showing lattice instability, as reported in the experimental literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A drastic variation (~47%) in thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) for synthesized samples (TiCoSb1+x, x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06) is observed. The lowest \k{appa} is reported for the TiCoSb1.02 sample. Thermal variation of \k{appa} is estimated from the temperature and power-dependent Raman spectroscopy data. Embedded phases and Co vacancy are analysed, employing scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy reveals the Co vacancy in synthesized samples, and the most ordered phase is TiCoSb1.02 amid the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement of the synthesized samples provides direct evidence of Co vacancies and their increase with Sb concentration (x). Lattice dynamics are revealed using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) measurements. RS data accomplishes that variation in \k{appa} as a function of Sb concentration is observed owing to an alteration in phonon group velocity, related to lattice softening. The polar nature of the TiCoSb half-Heusler (HH) sample is revealed. Longitudinal Optical and Transvers Optical phonon (LO-TO) splitting in RS is observed due to the polar nature of TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Tailoring in LO-TO splitting due to the screening effect, correlated with Co vacancies, is reported for TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Lattice softening and LO-TO splitting lead to a minimum \k{appa} for the TiCoSb1.02 synthesized sample.</description>

Abstract: The combination of quantum geometry and magnetic geometry in magnets excites diverse phenomena, some critical for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, with the material pool restricted by the assumed need for strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we bypass the need for SOC by considering magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding nonlinear transports (NLTs) in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometries can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar ones may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Using this approach, we establish a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects, and complement this with first-principles calculations on several prototypical material candidates. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-forbidden intraband transitions leading to ultralow Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at low temperature because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the N\'eel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the N\'eel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.</description>

      <title>A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. The manifestation of this braided chain in the lattice model points to the potential emergence of a shift from cooperative capture to that of a phase transition. In addition to the physical insights, this work may serve as a launching off point for further work on this and related materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study benchmarks the GFN family of semiempirical methods (GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF) against density functional theory (DFT) for the evaluation of optimized molecular geometries and electronic properties of small organic semiconductor molecules. This work offers a systematic assessment of these computationally efficient quantum chemical methods and their accuracy-cost profiles when applied to a challenging class of systems, characterized, for instance, by extended $\pi$-conjugation, conformational flexibility, and sensitivity of properties to subtle structural changes. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, and angles, while electronic property prediction is assessed via HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, with the choice of method depending on accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken charge-ordered ground state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) offers a unique platform for studying the interplay between a charge density wave transition with superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry. Despite characterizing the charge density wave phase is crucial to understand and model all these exotic properties, it remains unresolved. In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry is crucial for understanding intricate condensed matter systems, governing transport phenomena and optical responses. However, traditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing exclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space parameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic effects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work, we reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic wave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry curvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced velocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We further connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses, particularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and characterization of EPC quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>A Generation Framework with Strict Constraints for Crystal Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</description>
