      <title>Accelerated, Memory-Efficient Far-Field Scattering Computation with Monte Carlo SBR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Monte Carlo integration-based Shooting and Bouncing Ray (SBR) algorithm for electromagnetic scattering, specifically targeting complex dielectric materials. Unlike traditional deterministic SBR methods, our approach is the first to reformulate the SBR integral equations using Monte Carlo techniques and advanced variance reduction strategies adapted from photorealistic rendering. This enables efficient, massively parallel computation on modern GPUs, resulting in up to a 10-15x reduction in memory usage and a 4x speed up in runtime, particularly for multilayer dielectric structures. Our method emphasizes high-energy propagation paths, efficiently capturing long multipath and interreflection effects. Verification on canonical 3D geometries and ISAR imaging of both conducting and dielectric representative aircraft models demonstrates that our Monte Carlo SBR achieves high accuracy while maintaining low noise, making it suitable for downstream imaging and analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>CometNet: Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term Time Series Forecasting is crucial across numerous critical domains, yet its accuracy remains fundamentally constrained by the receptive field bottleneck in existing models. Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Forecasting of Human Behavior using Generative AI and Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel framework for counterfactual user behavior forecasting that combines structural causal models with transformer-based generative artificial intelligence. To model fictitious situations, the method creates causal graphs that map the connections between user interactions, adoption metrics, and product features. The framework generates realistic behavioral trajectories under counterfactual conditions by using generative models that are conditioned on causal variables. Tested on datasets from web interactions, mobile applications, and e-commerce, the methodology outperforms conventional forecasting and uplift modeling techniques. Product teams can effectively simulate and assess possible interventions prior to deployment thanks to the framework improved interpretability through causal path visualization.</description>

      <title>Physical regularized Hierarchical Generative Model for Metallic Glass Structural Generation and Energy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered materials such as glasses, unlike crystals, lack long range atomic order and have no periodic unit cells, yielding a high dimensional configuration space with widely varying properties. The complexity not only increases computational costs for atomistic simulations but also makes it difficult for generative AI models to deliver accurate property predictions and realistic structure generation. In this work, we introduce GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that uses graph representations to learn compact, rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations. The resulting structured latent space not only enables efficient generation of novel, physically plausible structures but also supports exploration of the glass energy landscape. To enforce structural realism and physical fidelity, we augment GlassVAE with two physics informed regularizers, a radial distribution function (RDF) loss that captures characteristic short and medium range ordering and an energy regression loss that reflects the broad configurational energetics. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results highlight the critical impact of these regularizers. By encoding high dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it into structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a fast, physics aware path for modeling and designing disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical computational model of the human stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stomach plays a central role in digestion through coordinated muscle contractions, known as gastric peristalsis, driven by slow-wave electrophysiology. Understanding this process is critical for treating motility disorders such as gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Computer simulations can be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of these disorders and help to develop new therapies. However, existing approaches often neglect spatial heterogeneity, fail to capture large anisotropic deformations, or rely on computationally expensive three-dimensional formulations. We present here a computational framework of human gastric electromechanics, that combines a nonlinear, rotation-free shell formulation with a constrained mixture material model. The formulation incorporates active-strain, constituent-specific prestress, and spatially non-uniform parameter fields. Numerical examples demonstrate that the framework can reproduce characteristic features of gastric motility, including slow-wave entrainment, conduction velocity gradients, and large peristaltic contractions with physiologically realistic amplitudes. The proposed framework enables robust electromechanical simulations of the whole stomach at the organ scale. It thus provides a promising basis for future in silico studies of both physiological function and pathological motility disorders.</description>

      <title>Common Task Framework For a Critical Evaluation of Scientific Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming modeling and control in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. However, rapid development has outpaced the creation of standardized, objective benchmarks - leading to weak baselines, reporting bias, and inconsistent evaluations across methods. This undermines reproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific progress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for scientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data. Inspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for head-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark methods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz. These results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse objectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea surface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community engagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Gramian Angular Fields for Privacy-Preserving ECG Classification on Heterogeneous IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.</description>
