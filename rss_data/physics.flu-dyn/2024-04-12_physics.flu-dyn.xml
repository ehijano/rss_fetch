      <title>Experimental and numerical investigation of inertial particles in underexpanded jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments and numerical simulations of inertial particles in underexpanded jets are performed. The structure of the jet is controlled by varying the nozzle pressure ratio, while the influence of particles on emerging shocks and rarefaction patterns is controlled by varying the particle size and mass loading. Ultra-high-speed schlieren and Lagrangian particle tracking are used to experimentally determine the two-phase flow quantities. Three-dimensional simulations are performed using a high-order, low dissipative discretization of the gas phase while particles are tracked individually in a Lagrangian manner. A simple two-way coupling strategy is proposed to handle interphase exchange in the vicinity of shocks. Velocity statistics of each phase are reported for a wide range of pressure ratios, particle sizes, and volume fractions. The extent to which particles affect the location of the Mach disk are quantified and compared to previous work from the literature. Furthermore, a semi-analytic model is presented based on a one-dimensional Fanno flow that takes into account volume displacement by particles and interphase exchange due to drag and heat transfer. The percent shift in Mach disk is found to scale with the mass loading, nozzle pressure ratio, interphase slip velocity, and inversely with the particle diameter.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through rectangular cross-sections. For a given rectangular cross-section, this results in a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter as the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. We observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Wettability-dependent dissolution dynamics of oxygen bubbles on Ti64 substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the dissolution of a single oxygen bubble on a solid surface, here Titianium alloy Ti64, in ultrapure water with different oxygen undersaturation levels is investigated. For that purpose, a combination of shadowgraph technique and planar laser-induced fluorescence is used to measure simultaneously the changes in bubble geometry and in the dissolved oxygen concentration around the bubble. Two different wettabilities of the Ti64 surface are adjusted by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The dissolution process on the solid surface involves two distinct phases, namely bouncing of the oxygen bubble at the Ti64 surface and the subsequent dissolution of the bubble, primarily by diffusion. By investigating the features of oxygen bubbles bouncing, it was found that the boundary layer of dissolved oxygen surrounding the bubble surface is redistributed by the vortices emerging during bouncing. This establishes the initial conditions for the subsequent second dissolution phase of the oxygen bubbles on the Ti64 surfaces. In this phase, the mass transfer of O2 proceeds non-homogenously across the bubble surface, leading to an oxygen accumulation close to the Ti64 surface. We further show that the main factor influencing the differences in the dynamics of O2 bubble dissolution is the variation in the surface area of the bubbles available for mass transfer, which is determined by the substrate wettability. As a result, dissolution proceeds faster at the hydrophilic Ti64 surface due to the smaller contact angle, which provokes a larger surface area.</description>

      <title>TURB-Hel: an open-access database of helically forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TURB-Hel, a database formed by two datasets of incompressible homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, maintained in a statistically stationary state by fully helical forcing. The aim is to provide a dataset that clearly exhibits the phenomenon of the helicity cascade from the large to the small scales generated by a large-scale forcing that breaks the mirror symmetry. This database offers the possibility to realize a wide variety of analyses of fully developed turbulence from the sub-grid scale filtering up to the validation of an a posteriori LES. TURB-Hel is available for download using the SMART-Turb portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Modon solutions in an N-layer quasi-geostrophic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modons, or dipolar vortices, are common and long-lived features of the upper ocean, consisting of a pair of monopolar vortices moving through self-advection. Such structures remain stable over long times and may be important for fluid transport over large distances. Here we present a semi-analytical method for finding fully nonlinear modon solutions in a multi-layer quasi-geostrophic model with arbitrarily many layers. Our approach works by reducing the problem to a multi-parameter linear eigenvalue problem which can be solved using numerical techniques from linear algebra. The method is shown to replicate previous results for one and two-layer models and is applied to a three-layer model to find a solution describing a mid-depth propagating, topographic vortex.</description>

      <title>Active Carpets in floating viscous films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's aquatic environments are inherently stratified layered systems where interfaces between layers serve as ecological niches for microbial swimmers, forming colonies known as Active Carpet (AC). Previous theoretical studies have explored the hydrodynamic fluctuations exerted by ACs in semi-infinite fluid media, demonstrating their capability to enhance thermal diffusion and mass transport in aquatic systems. Yet, little is understood about the fluid dynamics and impact of ACs residing in confined layered environments, like slicks floating on water bodies. In this study, we report novel solutions for the hydrodynamic fluctuations induced by ACs geometrically confined between a free surface and a fluid-fluid interface characterized by a jump in fluid viscosity. Combining theory and numerical experiments, we investigate the topology of the biogenic hydrodynamic fluctuations in a confined, thin fluid environment. We reveal that within this thin layer, ACs gives shape to three characteristic regions: Region I is the closest zone to the AC and the fluid-fluid interface, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are dominantly vertical; Region II is further up from the AC and is characterized by isotropic hydrodynamic fluctuations; Region III is the furthest region, near the free surface and is dominated by horizontal flow fluctuations. We demonstrate that the extent of these regions depends strongly on the degree of confinement, i.e. the layer thickness and the strength of the viscosity jump. Lastly, we show that confinement fosters the emergence of large-scale flow structures within the layer housing the ACs--not previously reported. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay between confinement and hydrodynamics in floating viscous film biological systems, providing valuable insights with implications spanning from ecological conservation to bio-inspired engineering.</description>

      <title>Revisiting a drag partition model for canopy-like roughness elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows over a large surface area (S) covered by n obstacles experience an overall drag due to the presence of the ground and the protruding obstacles into the flow. The drag partition between the roughness obstacles and the ground is analyzed using an analytical model proposed by Raupach (1992) and is hereafter referred to as R92. The R92 is based on the premise that the wake behind an isolated roughness element can be described by a shelter area A and a shelter volume V. The individual sizes of A and V without any interference from other obstacles can be determined from scaling analysis for the spread of wakes. To upscale from an individual roughness element to n/S elements where wakes may interact, R92 adopted a background stress re-normalizing instead of reducing A or V with each element addition. This work shows that R92's approach only converges to a linear reduction in A and V for small n/S where wakes have low probability of interacting with one another. This probabilistic nature suggests that up-scaling from individual to multiple roughness elements can be re-formulated using stochastic averaging methods proposed here. The two approaches are shown to recover R92 under plausible conditions. Comparisons between R92 and available data on blocks and vegetation-like roughness elements confirm the practical utility of R92 and its potential use in large-scale models provided the relevant parameters accommodate certain features of the roughness element type (cube versus vegetation-like) and, to a lesser extent, their configuration throughout S.</description>

      <title>Toward ultra-efficient high fidelity predictions of wind turbine wakes: Augmenting the accuracy of engineering models via LES-trained machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel machine learning (ML) methodology for the efficient and cost-effective prediction of high-fidelity three-dimensional velocity fields in the wake of utility-scale turbines. The model consists of an auto-encoder convolutional neural network with U-Net skipped connections, fine-tuned using high-fidelity data from large-eddy simulations (LES). The trained model takes the low-fidelity velocity field cost-effectively generated from the analytical engineering wake model as input and produces the high-fidelity velocity fields. The accuracy of the proposed ML model is demonstrated in a utility-scale wind farm for which datasets of wake flow fields were previously generated using LES under various wind speeds, wind directions, and yaw angles. Comparing the ML model results with those of LES, the ML model was shown to reduce the error in the prediction from 20% obtained from the GCH model to less than 5%. In addition, the ML model captured the non-symmetric wake deflection observed for opposing yaw angles for wake steering cases, demonstrating a greater accuracy than the GCH model. The computational cost of the ML model is on par with that of the analytical wake model while generating numerical outcomes nearly as accurate as those of the high-fidelity LES.</description>

      <title>Towards resolving bedload flux variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods of determining the transport-driving bed shear stress, especially for very narrow or shallow channel flows, and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a non-empirical method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets, based on well-controlled experiments and CFD-DEM simulations, for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a prominent alternative model (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) seems falsified.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called ``torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10 percent, the ``Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability renowned in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>A closure mechanism for screech coupling in rectangular twin jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twin-jet configuration allows two different scenarios to close the screech feedback. For each jet, there is one loop involving disturbances which originate in that jet and arrive at its own receptivity point in-phase (self-excitation). The other loop is associated with free-stream acoustic waves that radiate from the other jet, reinforcing the self-excited screech (cross-excitation). In this work, the role of the free-stream acoustic mode and the guided jet mode as a closure mechanism for twin rectangular jet screech is explored by identifying eligible points of return for each path, where upstream waves propagating from such a point arrive at the receptivity location with an appropriate phase relation. Screech tones generated by these jets are found to be intermittent with an out-of-phase coupling as a dominant coupling mode. Instantaneous phase difference between the twin jets computed by the Hilbert transform suggests that a competition between out-of-phase and in-phase coupling is responsible for the intermittency. To model wave components of the screech feedback while ensuring perfect phase-locking, an ensemble average of leading spectral proper orthogonal decomposition modes is obtained from several segments of large-eddy simulations data that correspond to periods of invariant phase difference between the two jets. Each mode is then extracted by retaining relevant wavenumber components produced via a streamwise Fourier transform. Spatial cross-correlation analysis of the resulting modes shows that most of the identified points of return for the cross-excitation are synchronised with the guided jet mode self-excitation, supporting that it is preferred in closing rectangular twin-jet screech coupling.</description>

      <title>Approximation of sea surface velocity field by fitting surrogate two-dimensional flow to scattered measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a rapid approximation method is introduced to estimate the sea surface velocity field based on scattered measurements. The method uses a simplified two-dimensional flow model as a surrogate model, which mimics the real submesoscale flow. The proposed approach treats the interpolation of the flow velocities as an optimization problem, aiming to fit the flow model to the scattered measurements. To ensure consistency between the simulated velocity field and the measured values, the boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are adjusted during the optimization process. Additionally, the relevance of quantity and quality of the scattered measurements is assessed, emphasizing the importance of the measurement locations within the domain as well as explaining how these measurements contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the sea surface velocity field approximation. The proposed methodology has been successfully tested in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, leveraging measurements obtained from GPS drifters and HF-radar systems. The adaptability of this approach for different domains, measurement types and conditions implies that it is suitable for real-world submesoscale scenarios where only an approximation of the sea surface velocity field is sufficient.</description>

Abstract: We find solutions that describe the levelling of a thin fluid film, comprising a non-Newtonian power-law fluid, that coats a substrate and evolves under the influence of surface tension. We consider the evolution from both periodic and localised initial conditions as separate cases. Particular (similarity) solutions in each of these two cases exhibit the generic property that the profiles are weakly singular (that is, higher-order derivatives do not exist), at points where the pressure gradient vanishes. Numerical simulations of the thin film equation, with either periodic or localised initial condition, are shown to approach the appropriate particular solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speedup traditional algorithms for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata to eliminate classical computations and measurements at every time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step, removing a need for repeated measurements and state preparation (encoding). Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method delays the need for measurement to the end of the computation, so the algorithm is better suited for modern quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the checker-board deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme. The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical PDEs: the diffusion and Burgers' equations on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical solutions of the presented algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The horizontal grid spacing of numerical weather prediction models keeps decreasing towards the hectometric range. We perform limited-area simulations with the ICON model across horizontal grid spacings (1 km, 500 m, 250 m, 125 m) in the Inn Valley, Austria, and evaluate the model with observations from the CROSSINN measurement campaign. This allows us to investigate whether increasing the horizontal resolution automatically improves the representation of the flow structure, surface exchange, and common meteorological variables. Increasing the horizontal resolution results in an improved simulation of the thermally-induced circulation. However, the model still faces challenges with scale interactions and the evening transition of the up-valley flow. Differences between two turbulence schemes (1D TKE and 3D Smagorinsky) emerge due to their different surface transfer formulations, yielding a delayed evening transition in the 3D Smagorinsky scheme. Generally speaking, the correct simulation of the mountain boundary layer depends mostly on the representation of model topography and surface exchange, and the choice of turbulence parameterization is secondary.</description>

      <title>A two-circuit approach to reducing quantum resources for the quantum lattice Boltzmann method</title>

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.</description>
