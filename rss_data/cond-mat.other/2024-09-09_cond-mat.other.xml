      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Engineering unique localization transition with coupled Hatano-Nelson chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hatano-Nelson (HN) Hamiltonian has played a pivotal role in catalyzing research interest in non-Hermitian systems, primarily because it showcases unique physical phenomena that arise solely due to non-Hermiticity. The non-Hermiticity in the HN Hamiltonian, driven by asymmetric hopping amplitudes, induces a delocalization-localization (DL) transition in a one-dimensional (1D) lattice with random disorder, sharply contrasting with its Hermitian counterpart. A similar DL transition occurs in a 1D quasiperiodic HN (QHN) lattice, where a critical quasiperiodic potential strength separates metallic and insulating states, akin to the Hermitian case. In these systems, all states below the critical potential are delocalized, while those above are localized. In this study, we reveal that coupling two 1D QHN lattices can significantly alter the nature of the DL transition. We identify two critical points, $V_{c1} &lt; V_{c2}$, when the nearest neighbors of the two 1D QHN lattices are cross-coupled with strong hopping amplitudes under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Generally, all states are completely delocalized below $ V_{c1}$ and completely localized above $V_{c2}$, while two mobility edges symmetrically emerge about $\rm{Re[E]} = 0$ between $V_{c1}$ and $V_{c2}$. Notably, under specific asymmetric cross-hopping amplitudes, $V_{c1}$ approaches zero, resulting in localized states even for infinitesimally weak potential. Remarkably, we also find that the mobility edges precisely divide the delocalized and localized states in equal proportions. Furthermore, we observe that the conventional one-to-one correspondence between electronic states under PBC and open boundary conditions (OBC) in 1D HN lattices breaks</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of many-body states by the ponderomotive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ponderomotive force is an effective static force that a particle feels in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the ponderomotive potential. We generalize this notion to periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient tool to engineer their non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle level. Applied to materials driven by light, the ponderomotive potential is intimately related to the equilibrium optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to resonances. We show that the ponderomotive potential from the incident light may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are presented with experimentally relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>
