      <title>New logarithmic power nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-Gaussons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a logarithmic-power nonlinearity that admits exact localized solutions of super-Gaussian form. The resulting stationary states possess flat-top profiles with sharp edges and are referred to as super-Gaussons, in analogy with the Gaussian Gaussons of the classical logarithmic NLS (log-NLS). The model, which we call the logarithmic-power NLS (logp-NLS), is parameterized by an exponent $p\geq1$ that controls the degree of flatness of the soliton core and the sharpness of its decay. Mathematically, $p$ interpolates between the standard log-NLS ($p=1$) and increasingly flat-top profiles as $p$ increases, while physically it governs the stiffness of an underlying logarithmic-power compressibility law. The proposed equation is constructed so as to admit super-Gaussian stationary states and can be interpreted a posteriori within a generalized pressure-law framework, thereby extending the log-NLS. We investigate the dynamics of super-Gaussons in one spatial dimension through numerical simulations for various values of $p$, demonstrating how this parameter regulates both the internal structure of the soliton and its collision dynamics. The logp-NLS thus generalizes the standard log-NLS by admitting a broader family of localized states with distinctive structural and dynamical properties, suggesting its relevance for flat-top solitons in nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and related nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Periodic Cluster Pattern of Coupled Forced Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model for periodic clustering of particles under forced oscillation. Effective viscosity is assumed to increase owing to neighboring particles by analogy with the Einstein viscosity law. The linear stability analysis and numerical simulations show that the uniform distribution is unstable, and spatially-periodic and stripe patterns appear respectively in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of pulled and pushed fronts in the nonautonomous Fisher-KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical method for direct simulation of front propagation in the Fisher-KPP equation with a time-dependent parameter on an infinite domain. The method computes a time-dependent boundary condition that accurately captures the leading-edge dynamics by coupling the nonlinear simulation region to a linear approximation region in which the dynamics can be solved exactly via the Green's function of the linearized equation. This approach enables precise front velocity measurements on relatively small computational domains for a variety of nonautonomous regimes and initial conditions for which existing numerical methods break down. We apply the method to pulled and pushed fronts in the Fisher-KPP equation with quadratic and quadratic-cubic nonlinearities, finding that it improves the accuracy of the simulated front velocity even for constant parameters and a fixed domain size. For pulled fronts with a diffusion coefficient that increases algebraically in time, our results reveal a deviation from the natural asymptotic velocity predicted by linear theory, whose explanation requires nonlinear theory. For pushed fronts with constant parameters, the method reproduces the exponential convergence to the theoretical asymptotic front speed and profile with improved precision. For a slowly time-varying linear growth parameter, we find that the pushed front velocity follows the changing parameter adiabatically if the asymptotic pushed velocity remains faster than the natural asymptotic pulled velocity. As the growth parameter moves toward the pushed--pulled transition point, the competition between the pushed and pulled fronts can result in both delayed and even premature onset of the pushed--pulled transition, depending on the form of parameter growth. The numerical method presented here proves to be an effective tool for analyzing front propagation in nonautonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.</description>
