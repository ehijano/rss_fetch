      <title>Determination of Land\'{e} $g_J$ factor and Zeeman coefficients in ground-state $^{171}$Yb$^+$ and their applications to quantum frequency standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the determination of the Land\'{e} $g_J$ factor and Zeeman coefficients for the ground-state of $^{171}$Yb$^+$, relevant to microwave quantum frequency standards (QFSs). The $g_J$ factor is obtained by using two independent methods: multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and multireference configuration interaction, yielding a consistent value of 2.002615(70). The first- and second-order Zeeman coefficients are determined as 14,010.78(49) Hz/$\mu$T and 31.0869(22) mHz/$\mu$T$^2$, respectively, based on the calculated $g_J$ factor. These coefficients enable reduced magnetic-field-induced uncertainties, improving the accuracy of the $^{171}$Yb$^+$ microwave QFSs. The results reported in this work also offer potential for improved constraints on variations in fundamental constants through frequency comparisons, and advancing trapped-ion quantum computers based on the ground-state hyperfine splitting of $^{171}$Yb$^+$.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we report a comprehensive calculation of static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements using the finite-field approach in conjunction with the relativistic coupled-cluster method, including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Relativistic effects are systematically explored, encompassing scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and full Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The recommended polarizability values, with uncertainties, are $37.95 \pm 0.77$ a.u. for Zn, $45.68 \pm 1.21$ a.u. for Cd, $34.04 \pm 0.68$ a.u. for Hg, and $27.92 \pm 0.28$ a.u. for Cn. These results are in excellent agreement with the 2018 compilation of static dipole polarizabilities [Mol. Phys. \textbf{117}, 1200 (2019)] and reduce uncertainties for Cd and Cn. Our analysis demonstrates that scalar-relativistic effects dominate the relativistic corrections, with SOC contributions found to be negligible. The role of electron correlation is examined across all relativistic regimes, highlighting its critical importance in achieving accurate polarizability predictions.</description>

      <title>Engineering One Axis Twisting via a Dissipative Berry Phase Using Strong Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a driven-dissipative cavity coupled to a collective ensemble of atoms can dynamically generate metrologically useful spin-squeezed states. In contrast to other dissipative approaches, we do not rely on complex engineered dissipation or input states, nor do we require tuning the system to a critical point. Instead, we utilize a strong symmetry, a special type of symmetry that can occur in open quantum systems and emerges naturally in systems with collective dissipation, such as superradiance. This symmetry preserves coherence and allows for the accumulation of an atom number-dependent Berry phase which in turn creates spin-squeezed states via emergent one-axis twisting dynamics. This work shows that it is possible to generate entanglement in an atom-cavity resonant regime with macroscopic optical excitations of the system, going beyond the typical dispersive regime with negligible optical excitations often utilized in current cavity QED experiments.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event ion-electron coincidence, time-of-flight, and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology to introduce Auger emitters into the detection region with well-defined initial conditions, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities to simultaneously detect multiple electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. This data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be most effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>
