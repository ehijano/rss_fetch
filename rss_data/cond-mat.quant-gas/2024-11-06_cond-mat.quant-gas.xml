      <title>Transfer of solitons and half-vortex solitons via adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that transfer of matter-wave solitons and half-vortex solitons in a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate between two (or more) arbitrarily chosen sites of an optical lattice can be implemented using the adiabatic passage. The underlying linear Hamiltonian has a flat band in its spectrum, so that even sufficiently weak inter-atomic interactions can sustain well-localized Wannier solitons which are involved in the transfer process. The adiabatic passage is assisted by properly chosen spatial and temporal modulations of the Rabi frequency. Within the framework of a few-mode approximation, the mechanism is enabled by a dark state created by coupling the initial and target low-energy solitons with a high-energy extended Bloch state, like in the conventional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage used for the coherent control of quantum states. In real space, however, the atomic transfer between initial and target states is sustained by the current carried by the extended Bloch state which remains populated during the whole process. The full description of the transfer is provided by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Protocols for the adiabatic passage are described for one- and two-dimensional optical lattices, as well as for splitting and subsequent transfer of an initial wavepacket simultaneously to two different target locations.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum-classical transition behavior of LGI in a dissipative quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) is a powerful tool for distinguishing between quantum and classical properties in studies of macroscopic systems. Applying the LGI to non-Hermitian systems with dissipation presents a fascinating opportunity, as competing mechanisms can either strengthen or weaken LGI violations. On one hand, dissipation-induced nonlinear interactions amplify LGI violations compared to Hermitian systems; on the other hand, dissipation leads to decoherence, which could weaken the LGI violation. In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian system of ultracold Fermi gas with dissipation. Our experiments reveal that as dissipation increases, the upper bound of the third-order LGI parameter $K_3$ initially rises, reaching its maximum at the exceptional point (EP), where $K_3 = C_{21} + C_{32} - C_{31}$, encompassing three two-time correlation functions. Beyond a certain dissipation threshold, the LGI violation weakens, approaching the classical limit, indicating a quantum-to-classical transition (QCT). Furthermore, we observe that the LGI violation decreases with increasing evolution time, reinforcing the QCT in the time domain. This study provides a crucial stepping stone for using the LGI to explore the QCT in many-body open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Modulation of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates: analytical characterization of acceleration-induced transitions between energy bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of modulating spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates are analytically studied. A sinusoidal driving of the coupling amplitude is shown to induce significant changes in the energy bands and in the associated spin-momentum locking. Moreover, in agreement with recent experimental results, gravitational acceleration of the modulated system is found to generate transitions between the modified energy bands. The applicability of the Landau-Zener (LZ) model to the understanding of the experimental findings is rigorously traced. Through a sequence of unitary transformations and the reduction to the spin space, the modulated Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated, is shown to correspond to an extended version of the LZ scenario. The generalization of the basic LZ model takes place along two lines. First, the dimensionality is enlarged to combine the description of the external dynamics with the internal-state characterization. Second, the model is extended to incorporate two avoided crossings emerging from the changes induced in the energy bands by the modulation. Our approach allows a first-principle derivation of the effective model-system parameters. The obtained analytical results provide elements to control the transitions.</description>

      <title>Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-coupling-induced phase separation in trapped Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a trapped spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate with miscible interactions, a two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling can introduce an unconventional spatial separation between the two components. We reveal the physical mechanism of such a spin-orbit-coupling-induced phase separation. Detailed features of the phase separation are identified in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. We further analyze differences of phase separation in Rashba and anisotropic spin-orbit-coupled Bose gases. An adiabatic splitting dynamics is proposed as an application of the phase separation.</description>

      <title>Tunable nonlinear Landau-Zener tunnelings in a spin-orbit-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling is an important nonlinear phenomenon. We propose to stimulate the nonlinear tunneling in a spin-orbit-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The system provides an experimentally tunable nonlinearity as well as multiple avoided crossings with tunable gap size in nonlinear dispersion relations. The nonlinearity generates tilted cusp and loop structures around the avoided crossings, and the physical consequence of these nonlinear structures is the nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling. The spin-momentum locking induced by the spin-orbit coupling leads to a time-resolved observation of the nonlinear tunneling by measuring atom populations.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas at thermal equilibrium. Recently, such excitations were investigated for the ground state of the system, and discovered that they prevail for evaluating the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. Here we extend it for finite temperatures.</description>
