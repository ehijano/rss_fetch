      <title>Interaction-Induced Dimensional Crossover through Full 3D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of dimensional crossover carries profound fundamental significance, serving as a crucial bridge in comprehending the remarkable disparities observed in transitional phenomena across the two distinct dimensions of a physical system. The prevalent strategy for manipulating the dimensionality involves meticulously controlling the external trapping geometry, thereby restricting the degrees of freedom of the kinetic energy from three-dimensional (3D) to lower-dimensional spaces, while maintaining the 3D nature of the interaction energy degrees of freedom. The aim of this work is to introduce an innovative scenario to achieve dimensional crossover, characterized by lower-D nature of both the kinetic and the interaction energy degrees of freedom. To accomplish this objective, we delve deeply into the realm of a 2D optically trapped Bose gas, focusing specifically on its finite-range interaction. Our emphasis lies in exploring the lattice-induced dimensional crossover from full 3D to 1D in both kinetic and interaction terms. Utilizing the functional path integral method, we derive the equation of states of the model system, encompassing crucial quantities such as the ground state energy and quantum depletion. These equations enable us to analyze the combined effects of finite range interaction and an optical lattice on quantum fluctuations of the BEC system. Notably, our analytical findings reconcile the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy in 3D and Lieb-Liniger (LL) ones in 1D limit, thereby providing fresh insights into the intriguing disparities between LHY and LL corrections.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Functional Determinant Approach and its Application to Polaron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional determinant approach (FDA) is a simple method to compute exactly certain observables for ideal quantum systems and has been successfully applied to the Fermi polaron problem to obtain the dynamical overlap and spectral function. Unfortunately, its application to Bosonic ultracold gases is prohibited by the failure of the grand canonical ensemble for these systems. In this paper, we show how to circumvent this problem and develop a Bosonic FDA. This yields exact injection and ejection spectra for ideal Bose polarons at arbitrary temperatures. While coherent features visible at absolute zero quickly smear out with rising temperature as expected, the line width of the main peak is, counterintuitively, found to decrease near unitarity. We compare the results to the Fermi polaron problem, for which we provide more detailed spectra than previously available by deriving an explicit formula for the overlap operator.</description>

      <title>Lattice Polaron in a Bose-Einstein Condensate of Hard-Core Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice polarons, quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an impurity and its surrounding bosonic environment confined to a lattice system, have emerged as a platform for generating complex few-body states, probing many-body phenomena, and addressing long-standing problems in physics. In this study, we employ a variational ansatz to investigate the quasiparticle and spectral properties of an impurity coupled to a condensate gas of hard-core bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice. Our findings demonstrate that the polaron features can be tuned by adjusting the filling factor of the bath, revealing intriguing polaron characteristics in the strongly interacting regime. These results offer valuable insights for lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases and can serve as a guide for new experiments in emergent quantum devices, such as moir\'e materials, where optical excitations can be described in terms of hard-core bosons.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of density and spin density fluctuations of an attractive two-dimensional Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage unbiased auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods interfaced with cutting-edge analytic continuation tools to compute from first-principles dynamical correlations for a dilute homogeneous two-dimensional attractive Fermi gas. Our main purpose is to quantitatively study the collective excitations of the system to shed light into fermionic superfluidity in the strongly correlated regime. Despite the fact that we are somewhat limited by finite-size effects, our study pinpoints a clear peak in the spin channel at low momentum, and we discuss the possibility that such a peak can be interpreted as the Higgs mode in the superfluid. Our study is complemented by a systematic comparison with the predictions of generalized random phase approximation, with the dual purpose to directly compare with auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo and to quantitatively study finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties and thermodynamic anomalies of supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a supersolid in the context of a Gross-Pitaevskii theory with a non-local effective potential. We employ a homogenisation technique which allows us to calculate the elastic moduli, supersolid fraction and other state variables of the system. Our methodology is verified against numerical simulations of elastic deformations. We can also verify that the long-wavelength Goldstone modes that emerge from this technique agree with Bogoliubov theory. We find a thermodynamic anomaly that the supersolid does not obey the thermodynamic relation $\partial P / \partial V \bigr|_N = - n \, \partial P / \partial N \bigr|_V$, which we claim is a feature unique to supersolids.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a Bose gas in three dimensions of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range or contact interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. It is known that if one imposes the same kind of boundary condition of the one-body problem with a point interaction then one is inevitably led to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below and therefore unstable. This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes too strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such instability property, we develop a suggestion formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 and introduce a slightly modified boundary condition which reduces the strength of the interaction when the positions of the particles $i, j$ coincide in the following cases: a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; b) two other particles approach to each other. In all the other cases the usual boundary condition is restored. Following a quadratic form approach, we prove that the Hamiltonian characterized by such modified boundary condition is self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also show that the N-body Hamiltonian with contact interactions obtained years ago by Albeverio, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977) is a special case of our Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U (band regime) to large U (correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of tem-perature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlation to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, at both and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect driven by phonon-magnon hybridization in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van de Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle ($\kappa_{ab}/\kappa_{aa}/B$) respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The exponential temperature dependence of $\kappa_{ab}$ above its peak reveals an energy scale on the order of magnitude of the gap expected to be opened by magnon-phonon hybridization. This points to an intrinsic scenario for THE with possible relevance to other magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension where the boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. Quench processes that start deep in the Mott phase and end in the weak Mott phase show light-cone-like spreading in the dipole correlation function but not in the single-boson correlator, which is suppressed due to the dipole conservation. The phase and the group velocities estimated from the dilute-dipolon approximation are in excellent agreement with those of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle method. The quench from the dipole-condensed (DC) phase to the Mott phase shows periodic kinks in the Loschmidt echo and the demise and revival of Bose-condensed peaks in the dipole momentum distribution function, both of which are noted features of dynamical quantum phase transition. The Mott-to-DC quench, on the other hand, shows none of these features despite the quench parameters varying across the equilibrium quantum critical point. Our findings on the fractonic quench dynamics can be checked in the tilted optical lattice experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate prospects for the creation of nonclassical spin states in trapped ion arrays by coupling to a squeezed state of the collective motion of the ions. The correlations of the generated spin states can be tailored for quantum-enhanced sensing of global or differential rotations of sub-ensembles of the spins by working with specific vibrational modes of the ion array. We propose a pair of protocols to utilize the generated states and determine the impact of finite size effects, inhomogeneous couplings between the spin and motional degrees of freedom and technical noise. Our work suggests new opportunities for the preparation of many-body states with tailored correlations for quantum-enhanced metrology in spin-boson systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator. Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed) attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.</description>
