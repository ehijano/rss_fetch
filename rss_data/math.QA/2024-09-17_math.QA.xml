      <title>Counting in Calabi--Yau categories, with applications to Hall algebras and knot polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that homotopy cardinality -- a priori ill-defined for many dg-categories, including all periodic ones -- has a reasonable definition for even-dimensional Calabi--Yau (evenCY) categories and their relative generalizations (under appropriate finiteness conditions).
  As a first application we solve the problem of defining an intrinsic Hall algebra for degreewise finite pre-triangulated dg-categories in the case of oddCY categories. We compare this definition with To\"en's derived Hall algebras (in case they are well-defined) and with other approaches based on extended Hall algebras and central reduction, including a construction of Hall algebras associated with Calabi--Yau triples of triangulated categories. For a category equivalent to the root category of a 1CY abelian category $\mathcal A$, the algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of the twisted Ringel--Hall algebra of $\mathcal A$, thus resolving in the Calabi--Yau case the long-standing problem of realizing the latter as a Hall algebra intrinsically defined for such a triangulated category.
  Our second application is the proof of a conjecture of Ng--Rutherford--Shende--Sivek, which provides an intrinsic formula for the ruling polynomial of a Legendrian knot $L$, and its generalization to Legendrian tangles, in terms of the augmentation category of $L$.</description>

      <title>Generalised 6j symbols over the category of $G$-graded vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any choice of a spherical fusion category defines an invariant of oriented closed 3-manifolds, which is computed by choosing a triangulation of the manifold and considering a state sum model that assigns a 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in this triangulation. This approach has been generalized to oriented closed 3-manifolds with defect data by Meusburger. In a recent paper, she constructed a family of invariants for such manifolds parametrised by the choice of certain spherical fusion categories, bimodule categories, finite bimodule functors and module natural transformations. Meusburger defined generalised 6j symbols for these objects, and introduces a state sum model that assigns a generalised 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in the triangulation of a manifold with defect data, where the type of 6j symbol used depends on what defect data occur within the tetrahedron. The present work provides non-trivial examples of suitable bimodule categories, bimodule functors and module natural transformation, all over categories of $G$-graded vector spaces. Our main result is the description of module functors in terms of matrices, which allows us to classify these functors when $G$ is a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we calculate the generalised 6j symbols for categories of $G$-graded vector spaces, (bi-)module categories over such categories and (bi-)module functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a freely generated pregraded vertex superalgebra, $H$ a Hamiltonian operator of $V$, and $g$ a diagonalizable automorphism of V commuting with $H$ with modulus $1$ eigenvalues. We prove that the $(g, H)$-twisted Zhu algebra of $V$ has a PBW basis, is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of some non-linear Lie superalgebra, and satisfies the commutativity of BRST cohomology functors, which generalizes results of De Sole and Kac. As applications, we compute the twisted Zhu algebras of affine vertex superalgebras and affine $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantized function algebras at $q=0$: type $A_{n}$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of quantized function algebras at $q=0$ or crystallization of the $q$ deformations of the type $A_{n}$ compact Lie groups at the $C^*$-algebra level. The $C^{*}$-algebra $A_{n}(0)$ is defined as a universal $C^*$-algebra given by a finite set of generators and relations. We obtain these relations by looking at the irreducible representations of the quantized function algebras for $q&gt;0$ and taking limit as $q\to 0+$ after rescaling the generating elements appropriately. We then prove that in the $n=2$ case the irreducible representations $A_{2}(0)$ are precisely the $q\to 0+$ limits of the irreducible representations of the $C^*$-algebras $A_{2}(q)$.</description>

      <title>Theta series for quantum loop algebras and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a family of power series, which we call Theta series, whose coefficients are in the tensor square of a quantum loop algebra. They arise from a coproduct factorization of the T-series of Frenkel--Hernandez, which are leading terms of transfer matrices of certain infinite-dimensional irreducible modules over the upper Borel subalgebra in the category O of Hernandez--Jimbo. We prove that each weight component of a Theta series is polynomial. As applications, we establish a decomposition formula and a polynomiality result for R-matrices between an irreducible module and a finite-dimensional irreducible module in category O.
  We extend T-series and Theta series to Yangians by solving difference equations determined by the truncation series of Gerasimov--Kharchev--Lebedev--Oblezin. We prove polynomiality of Theta series by interpreting them as associators for triple tensor product modules over shifted Yangians.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Higher Verlinde Categories: The Mixed Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, the higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}$ are obtained by taking the abelian envelope of quotients of the category of tilting modules for the algebraic group $\mathrm{SL}_2$. These symmetric tensor categories have been introduced in arXiv:2003.10499 &amp; arXiv:2003.10105, and their properties have been extensively studied in the former reference. In arXiv:2105.07724, the above construction for $\mathrm{SL}_2$ has been generalized to Lusztig's quantum group for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and root of unity $\zeta$, which produces the mixed higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$. Inspired by the results of arXiv:2003.10499, we study the properties of these braided tensor categories in detail. In particular, we establish a Steinberg tensor product formula for the simple objects of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, construct a braided embedding $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n+1)}}$, compute the symmetric center of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, and identify its Grothendieck ring.</description>
