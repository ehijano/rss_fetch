      <title>Hotspots and Photon Rings in Schwarzschild Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future black hole (BH) imaging observations with better sensitivity and angular resolution are expected to resolve finer features corresponding to higher-order images of both hotspots that are produced in the accretion flow, as well as of the entire emitting region. In spherically symmetric spacetimes, the image order is determined by the maximum number of half-loops executed around the BH by the photons that form it. Due to the additional half-loop, consecutive-order images arrive after a delay time of approximately $\pi$ times the BH shadow radius. Furthermore, the deviation of the diameters from that of the shadow, widths, and flux-densities of consecutive-order images are exponentially demagnified by the lensing Lyapunov exponent, a characteristic of the spacetime. We compare the exact time delay between the appearance of the zeroth and first-order images of a hotspot to our best analytic estimate and find an error $\lesssim 50\%$ for hotspot locations within $\approx 10M$ from a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$. We also explore the possibilities for inferring kinetic properties of hotspots, and also our inclination, from future BH movies. Furthermore, since the targets of such observations host geometrically-thick accretion flows (also jets), we obtain simple theoretical estimates of the variation in the diameters and widths of their first-order images, for varying disk scale-heights. We find realistically that the deviation of the former from that of the shadow is $\lesssim 30\%$ and that the latter remain $\lesssim 1.3M$. Finally, we estimate the error in recovering the lensing exponent, when using the first and second-order images, to be $\lesssim 20\%$. This provides further evidence that future observations could yield new and independent estimates of the shadow size and, in principle, of the lensing exponent, allowing us to robustly learn about the spacetimes of astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Circumbinary Disk Dynamics in Multi-Messenger Population Studies of Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of cutting-edge circumbinary disk (CBD) evolution models on massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations and the gravitational wave background (GWB). We show that CBD-driven evolution leaves a tell-tale signature in MBHB populations, by driving binaries towards an equilibrium eccentricity that depends on binary mass ratio. We find high orbital eccentricities ($e_{\rm b} \sim 0.5$) as MBHBs enter multi-messenger observable frequency bands. The CBD-induced eccentricity distribution of MBHB populations in observable bands is independent of the initial eccentricity distribution at binary formation, erasing any memory of eccentricities induced in the large-scale dynamics of merging galaxies. Our results suggest that eccentric MBHBs are the rule rather than the exception in upcoming transient surveys, provided that CBDs regularly form in MBHB systems. We show that the GWB amplitude is sensitive to CBD-driven preferential accretion onto the secondary, resulting in an increase in GWB amplitude $A_{\rm yr^{-1}}$ by over 100\% with just 10\% Eddington accretion. As we self consistently allow for binary hardening and softening, we show that CBD-driven orbital expansion does not diminish the GWB amplitude, and instead increases the amplitude by a small amount. We further present detection rates and population statistics of MBHBs with $M_{\rm b} \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$ in LISA, showing that most binaries have equal mass ratios and can retain residual eccentricities up to $e_{\rm b} \sim 10^{-3}$ due to CBD-driven evolution.</description>

      <title>Collapsar disk outflows I: Viscous hydrodynamic evolution in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate mass ejection from accretion disks formed during the collapse of rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The neutrino-cooled, black hole (BH) accretion disk system that forms at the center of the star -- and the ensuing outflows -- provide the conditions for these systems to be candidate $r$-process element production sites and potential progenitors of broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae. Here we present global, long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of collapsar disks that include angular momentum transport through shear viscosity, neutrino emission and absorption, a 19-isotope nuclear reaction network and nuclear statistical equilibrium solver, a pseudo-Newtonian BH with mass and spin modified by accreted matter, and self-gravity. Starting from a stellar profile collapsed in spherical symmetry, our models capture disk formation self-consistently, and are evolved until after the shock wave -- driven by disk winds -- reaches the surface of the star. None of our models achieve sufficient neutronization to eject significant amounts of $r$-process elements (detailed nucleosynthesis calculations will follow in a companion paper). Sufficient $^{56}$Ni is produced to power a typical type Ic-BL supernova light curve, but the average asymptotic velocity is a factor $\sim 2-3$ times too slow to account for the typical line widths in type Ic-BL supernova spectra. The gap in neutrino emission between BH formation and shocked disk formation, and the magnitude of the subsequent peak in emission, would be observable diagnostics of the internal conditions of the progenitor in a galactic collapsar. Periodic oscillations of the shocked disk prior to its expansion are also a potential observable through their impact on the the neutrino and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Nebular Nitrogen Line Emission in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae -- a New Progenitor Mass Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen is produced by CNO-cycling in massive stars, and can be ejected in significant amounts in supernova explosions. While in H-rich SNe, its [\ion{N}{II}] 6548, 6583 emission becomes obscured by strong H$\alpha$, in explosions of He stars, this nitrogen emission becomes more visible. We here explore the formation of this line, using the \texttt{SUMO} code to compute spectra for a grid of 1D models with parameterized mixing informed from new 2D simulations. Because the mass fraction of nitrogen in the ejecta decreases with larger He core masses, as more of the He/N zone gets processed by shell helium burning and is lost to winds, the [\ion{N}{II}] luminosity relative to the overall optical flux probes the He core mass. By comparing to large samples of data, we find that low-mass He cores ($M_{\rm preSN}\lesssim\ 3\ M_\odot$) are exclusively associated with Type IIb SNe, with the exception of Type Ib SN 2007Y. Seeing no strong nitrogen emission in other Type Ib SNe, the implication is either an origin from low-mass stars with the He/N layer (but not the He/C) layer peeled away, or from higher-mass He cores. We also see no clear nitrogen emission in Type Ic SNe. We discuss the diagnostic potential of this new line metric, and also dependencies on mass-loss-rate and metallicity.</description>

      <title>The fundamental plane of blazars based on the black hole spin-mass energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental plane of 91 Blazars which include FSRQs and BL Lacs with known X-ray luminosity ($L_{R}$), radio luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass measurements ($M$) to reflect the relationship between jet and accretion for blazars. The fundamental plane of Blazars are log$L_{R}$=${0.273}_{+0.059}^{-0.059}$log$L_X$+${0.695}_{+0.191}^{-0.191}$log$M$+${25.457}_{+2.728}^{-2.728}$ and log$L_{R}$=${0.190}_{+0.049}^{-0.049}$log$L_X$+${0.475}_{+0.157}^{-0.157}$log$M$+${28.568}_{+2.245}^{-2.245}$ after considering the effect of beam factor. Our results suggest that the jet of blazars has connection with accretion. We set the black hole spin energy as a new variable to correct the black hole mass and explore the effect of black hole spin on the fundamental relationship. We find that the fundamental plane of Blazars is effected by the black hole spin, which is similar to the previous work for AGNs. We additionally examine a new fundamental plane which is based on the black hole spin-mass energy ($M_{spin}$). The new fundamental plane (log$L_{R}$=${0.332}_{+0.081}^{-0.081}$log$L_X$+${0.502}_{+0.091}^{-0.091}$log$M_{spin}$+${22.606}_{+3.346}^{-3.346}$ with R-Square=0.575) shows that $M_{spin}$ has a better correlation coefficient comparing to the $M$ for fundamental plane of Blazars. These results support that the black hole spin should be considered as a important factor for the study of fundamental plane for Blazars. And these may further our understanding of the Blandford-Znajek process in blazars.</description>

      <title>Likely detection of magnetic field related LFQPO in the soft X-ray re-brightening of GRS~1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing NICER observations, we present an analysis of the soft X-ray re-brightening event of GRS 1915+105 observed in 2021. During this event, we observed the emergence of a stable, long-lasting low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) with frequencies ranging from 0.17 to 0.21 Hz. Through a careful spectral analysis, we demonstrate that a low-temperature Compton-thick gas model well characterizes the emitted radiation. By examining the spectrum and identifying numerous absorption lines, we discerned a transition in the wind properties. This transition was marked by a shift from a state characterized by low speed, high column density, and high ionization degree to one featuring still low speed but low column density and ionization degree. Intriguingly, the presence or absence of the QPO signal is perfectly correlated with these distinct wind characteristics. The low-speed wind observed could be indicative of a 'failed wind', while the observed shift implies a transition from a magnetically to a thermally driven wind. Notably, this QPO signal exclusively manifested itself during the magnetically driven phase, suggesting the possibility of a novel perturbation associated with magnetic effects.</description>

      <title>High-energy Neutrinos from Outflows Powered by Kicked Remnants of Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) could take place within the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emissions. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by the remnant BH wind within AGN disks. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, considering various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of the remnant BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the remnant BH wind, with the latter typically having a time gap to the GW event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.</description>

      <title>Expansion and Spectral Softening of the Dust Scattering Rings of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the {\it Swift} X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off, respectively, from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4-13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of $10^{7\sim8}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings show that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust scattering model predicts.</description>

      <title>An Extreme Ultra-Compact X-ray Binary in a Globular Cluster: Multi-Wavelength Observations of RZ2109 Explored in a Triple System Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The globular cluster ultraluminous X-ray source, RZ2109, is a complex and unique system which has been detected at X-ray, ultra-violet, and optical wavelengths. Based on almost 20 years of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, the X-ray luminosity exhibits order-of-magnitude variability, with the peak flux lasting on the order of a few hours. We perform robust time series analysis on the archival X-ray observations and find that this variability is periodic on a timescale of 1.3 $\pm 0.04$ days. The source also demonstrates broad [OIII] 5007 Angstrom emission, which has been observed since 2004, suggesting a white dwarf donor and therefore an ultra-compact X-ray binary. We present new spectra from 2020 and 2022, marking eighteen years of observed [OIII] emission from this source. Meanwhile, we find that the globular cluster counterpart is unusually bright in the NUV/UVW2 band. Finally, we discuss RZ2109 in the context of the eccentric Kozai Lidov mechanism and show that the observed 1.3 day periodicity can be used to place constraints on the tertiary configuration, ranging from 20 minutes (for a 0.1 ${\rm M}_\odot$ companion) to approximately 95 minutes (for a 1 ${\rm M}_\odot$ companion), if the eccentric Kozai Lidov mechanism is at the origin of the periodic variability.</description>

      <title>A targeted radio pulsar survey of redback candidates with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redbacks are millisecond pulsar binaries with low mass, irradiated companions. These systems have a rich phenomenology that can be used to probe binary evolution models, pulsar wind physics, and the neutron star mass distribution. A number of high-confidence redback candidates have been identified through searches for variable optical and X-ray sources within the localisation regions of unidentified but pulsar-like Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sources. However, these candidates remain unconfirmed until pulsations are detected. As part of the TRAPUM project, we searched for radio pulsations from six of these redback candidates with MeerKAT. We discovered three new radio millisecond pulsars, PSRs J0838$-$2527, J0955$-$3947 and J2333$-$5526, confirming their redback nature. PSR J0838$-$2827 remained undetected for two years after our discovery despite repeated observations, likely due to evaporated material absorbing the radio emission for long periods of time. While, to our knowledge, this system has not undergone a transition to an accreting state, the disappearance, likely caused by extreme eclipses, illustrates the transient nature of spider pulsars and the heavy selection bias in uncovering their radio population. Radio timing enabled the detection of gamma-ray pulsations from all three pulsars, from which we obtained 15-year timing solutions. All of these sources exhibit complex orbital period variations consistent with gravitational quadrupole moment variations in the companion stars. These timing solutions also constrain the binary mass ratios, allowing us to narrow down the pulsar masses. We find that PSR J2333$-$5526 may have a neutron star mass in excess of 2 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of orbital evolution of LMC X-4: Existence of a second derivative of the orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here results from pulse arrival time delay analysis of the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary pulsar LMC X-4 using observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and AstroSat. Combining the orbital parameters determined from these observations with the historical measurements dating back to 1998, we have extended the $T_{\pi/2}$ epoch history of LMC X-4 by about 4600 binary orbits spanning about 18 years. We also report mid-eclipse time measurements ($T_{ecl}$) using data obtained from wide-field X-ray monitors of MAXI-GSC and Swift-BAT. Combining the new $T_{\pi/2}$ and $T_{ecl}$ estimates with all the previously reported values, we have significantly improved the orbital evolution measurement, which indicates that the orbital period is evolving at a time scale ($P_{\rm orb}/\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ ) of about 0.8 Myr. For the first time in an accreting X-ray pulsar system, we confirm the existence of a second derivative of the orbital period, having an evolution time scale ($\dot{P}_{orb}/\ddot{P}_{orb}$) of about 55 yr. Detection of a second derivative of the orbital period in LMC X-4 makes its orbital evolution timescale more uncertain, which may also be true for other HMXBs. Independent solutions for the orbital evolution measurement using the mid-eclipse data and the pulse timing data are consistent with each other, and help us put an upper limit of 0.009 on the eccentricity of the binary system.</description>

      <title>Binarity Enhances the Occurrence Rate of Radiation Belt Emissions in Ultracool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a burgeoning set of ultracool dwarf ($\leq$M7) radio detections, their radio emissions remain enigmatic. Open questions include the plasma source and acceleration mechanisms for the non-auroral "quiescent" component of these objects' radio emissions, which can trace Jovian synchrotron radiation belt analogs. Ultracool dwarf binary systems can provide test beds for examining the underlying physics for these plasma processes. We extend a recently developed occurrence rate calculation framework to compare the quiescent radio occurrence rate of binary systems to single objects. This generalized and semi-analytical framework can be applied to any set of astrophysical objects conceptualized as unresolved binary systems with approximately steady-state emission or absorption. We combine data available in the literature to create samples of 179 single ultracool dwarfs (82 M dwarfs, 74 L dwarfs, and 23 T/Y dwarfs) and 27 binary ultracool dwarf systems. Using these samples, we show that quiescent radio emissions occur in $54^{+11}_{-11}$ - $65^{+11}_{-12}$ per cent of binaries where both components are ultracool dwarfs, depending on priors. We also show that binarity enhances the ultracool dwarf quiescent radio occurrence rate relative to their single counterparts. Finally, we discuss potential implications for the underlying drivers of ultracool dwarf quiescent radio emissions, including possible plasma sources.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>

Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Detecting the third family of compact stars with normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the anomaly detection framework based on Normalizing Flows (NF) models introduced in \cite{PhysRevC.106.065802} to detect the presence of a large (destabilising) dense matter phase transition in neutron star (NS) observations of masses and radii, and relate the feasibility of detection with parameters of the underlying mass-radius sequence, which is a functional of the dense matter equation of state. Once trained on simulated data featuring continuous $M(R)$ solutions (i.e., no phase transitions), NF is used to determine the likelihood of a first-order phase transition in a given set of $M(R)$ observations featuring a discontinuity, i.e., perform the anomaly detection. Different mock test sets, featuring two branch solutions in the $M(R)$ diagram, were parameterized by the NS mass at which the phase transition occurs, $M_c$, and the radius difference between the heaviest hadronic star and lightest hybrid star, $\Delta R$. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the NF performance in detecting the presence of a first-order phase transition. Among the results, we report that given a set of 15 stars with radius uncertainty of $0.2$ km, a detection of a two-branch solution is possible with 95\% accuracy if $\Delta R &gt; 0.4$ km.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Winds in X-rays -- SUBWAYS. III. A population study on Ultra-Fast Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of blue-shifted absorption lines likely associated with ionized Iron K-shell transitions in the X-ray spectra of many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) suggests the presence of a highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities (0.03c-0.6c), named Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO). Within the SUBWAYS project we characterized these winds starting from a sample of 22 radio-quiet quasars at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, and compared the results with similar studies in the literature on samples of 42 local radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies and 14 high redshift radio-quiet quasars. The scope of our work is a statistical study of UFO parameters and incidence, considering key physical properties of the sources, e.g. supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rates and Spectral Energy Distribution, with the aim of gaining new insights into the UFO launching mechanisms. We find indications that highly luminous AGN with steeper X-ray/UV ratio, are more likely to host UFO. The presence of UFO is not significantly related to any other AGN property in our sample. These findings suggest that the UFO phenomenon may be transient. Focusing on AGN with UFO, other important results are: (1) faster UFO have larger ionization parameters and column densities; (2) X-ray radiation plays a more crucial role in driving highly ionized winds compared to UV; (3) the correlation between outflow velocity and luminosity is significantly flatter than what expected for radiatively driven winds; (4) more massive BH experience higher wind mass-losses, suppressing accretion of matter onto the BH; (5) the UFO launching radius is positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. Furthermore, our analysis suggest the involvement of multiple launching mechanisms, including radiation pressure and magneto-hydrodynamic processes, rather than pointing to a single, universally applicable mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the process of an ultrarelativistic fluid accreted onto axisymmetric Kerr-Sen black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory. We obtain the solution describing the velocity potential of a stationary irrotational fluid with a stiff equation of state and the solution for the streamlined diagram of the quadrupolar flow. We also investigate how the solution's coefficients and the stagnation points are affected by the parameters. The injection rate, the ejection rate, and the critical angle are discussed in detail. We find that with an increasing dilaton parameter the ratio of the ejection rate to the injection rate increases and that the radiative efficiency is larger, while the redshift is lower, compared to the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.</description>

      <title>Formation of Merging Stellar-Mass Black Hole Binaries by Gravitational Wave Emission in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many stellar-mass Black Holes (sBHs) are expected to orbit supermassive black holes at galactic centers. For galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), it is likely that the sBHs reside in a disk. We study the formation of sBH binaries via gravitational wave emission in such disks. We examine analytically the dynamics of two sBHs orbiting a supermassive black hole, estimate the capture cross section, and derive the eccentricity distribution of bound binaries at different frequency bands. We find that the majority of the merging sBH binaries, assembled in this manner, can be measured as highly eccentric, detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band from their formation, with $(1-e)\ll1$, through their circularization and up to their merger; the remaining binaries circularize to small eccentricities ($e\lesssim0.3$) before entering the LVK band. More eccentric mergers would be observed for sBHs with higher random velocities, closer to the supermassive black hole, or at lower observing frequency bands, as planned in future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA.</description>

      <title>New limits on the local Lorentz invariance violation of gravity in the Standard-Model Extension with pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz Violation (LV) is posited as a possible relic effect of quantum gravity at low energy scales. The Standard-Model Extension provides an effective field-theoretic framework for examining possible deviations attributed to LV. With their high observational accuracy, pulsars serve as ideal laboratories for probing LV. In the presence of LV, both the spin precession of solitary pulsars and orbital dynamics of binary pulsars would undergo modifications. Observations of pulse profiles and times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses allow for an in-depth investigation of these effects, leading to the establishment of strict limits on LV coefficients. We revisit the project of limiting local LV with updated pulsar observations. We employ a new parameter estimation method and utilize state-of-the-art pulsar timing observation data and get new limits on 8 linear combinations of LV coefficients based on 25 tests from 12 different systems. Compared to previous limits from pulsars, precision has improved by a factor of two to three. Additionally, we explore prospects for further improvements from pulsars. Simulation results indicate that more observations of spin precession in solitary millisecond pulsars could significantly enhance the accuracy of spatial LV coefficients, potentially by three to four orders of magnitude. As observational data accumulate, pulsars are anticipated to increasingly contribute to the tests of LV.</description>

      <title>A nearby source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the Telescope Array collaboration reported an observation of cosmic ray event with very high energy 244 EeV ($2.44 \times 10^{20}$ eV). Importantly, the event is hard to correlate with the matter distribution in the local Universe, even after taking into account deflections in magnetic fields. This implies that the event is likely a nucleus with a large charge. An attenuation length of the nucleus of such a high energy in intergalactic space is quite small, therefore its source should be relatively close to our Galaxy. Using these arguments we derive a new upper bound on a distance to the closest ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) source and a lower bound on the UHECR source number density in general. The distance to the closest source should not exceed 5 Mpc at 95% C.L. and the 95% C.L. lower-bound on the sources number density is $\rho &gt; 1.0 \times 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. The number density of UHECR sources emitting heavy nuclei is constrained for the first time.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave imprints of non-convex dynamics in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers requires an understanding of matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Our current knowledge of the properties of high-density matter relies on electromagnetic and GW observations, nuclear physics experiments, and general relativistic numerical simulations. In this paper we perform numerical-relativity simulations of BNS mergers subject to non-convex dynamics, allowing for the appearance of expansive shock waves and compressive rarefactions. Using a phenomenological non-convex equation of state we identify observable imprints on the GW spectra of the remnant. In particular, we find that non-convexity induces a significant shift in the quasi-universal relation between the peak frequency of the dominant mode and the tidal deformability (of order $\Delta f_{\rm peak}\gtrsim 380\,\rm Hz$) with respect to that of binaries with convex (regular) dynamics. Similar shifts have been reported in the literature, attributed however to first-order phase transitions from nuclear/hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter. We argue that the ultimate origin of the frequency shifts is to be found in the presence of anomalous, non-convex dynamics in the binary remnant.</description>

      <title>eROSITA Detection of a Cloud Obscuration Event in the Seyfert AGN EC 04570-5206</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen broad observational support for the presence of a clumpy component within the circumnuclear gas around SMBHs. In the X-ray band, individual clouds can manifest themselves when they transit the line of sight to the X-ray corona, temporarily obscuring the X-ray continuum and thereby indicating the characteristics and location of these clouds. X-ray flux monitoring with SRG/eROSITA has revealed that in the Seyfert 1 AGN EC 04570-5206, the soft X-ray flux dipped abruptly for about 10-18 months over 2020-2021, only to recover and then drop a second time by early 2022. Here, we investigate whether these flux dips and recoveries could be associated with cloud occultation events. We complemented the eROSITA scans with multiwavelength follow-up observations, including X-ray/UV observations with Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER, along with ground-based optical photometric and spectroscopic observations to investigate the spectral and flux variability. XMM-Newton spectra confirm that the soft X-ray flux dips were caused by partial-covering obscuration by two separate clouds. The 2020-2021 event was caused by a cloud with column density near 1e22 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.6. The cloud in the 2022 event had a column density near 3e23 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.8. The optical/UV continuum flux varied minimally and the optical emission line spectra showed no variability in Balmer profiles or intensity. The transiting gas clouds are neutral or lowly-ionized, while the lower limits on their radial distances are commensurate with the dust sublimation zone (cloud 1) or the optical broad line region (cloud 2). One possible explanation is a dust-free, outflowing wind with embedded X-ray clumps. These events are the first cloud obscuration events detected in a Seyfert galaxy using eROSITA's X-ray monitoring capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be detected at cosmological distances and therefore can be used to study the contents and phases of the early Universe. The 4-150 keV wide-field trigger camera ECLAIRs to fly on board the Space-based multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) mission, dedicated to studying the high-energy transient sky in synergy with multi-messenger follow-up instruments, has been adapted to detect high-redshift (high-z) GRBs. Aims. Investigating the detection capabilities of ECLAIRs for high-z GRBs and estimating the impacts of instrumental biases in reconstructing some of the source measured properties, focusing on GRB duration biases as a function of redshift. Methods. We simulated realistic detection scenarios for a sample of 162 already observed GRBs with known redshift values as they would have been seen by ECLAIRs. We simulated them at redshift values equal and higher than their measured value. Then, we assessed whether they would be detected with a trigger algorithm resembling that on board of ECLAIRs, and derived quantities such as T90, for those that would have been detected. Results. We find that ECLAIRs would be capable of detecting GRBs up to very high redshift values (e.g. 20 GRBs in our sample are detectable within more than 0.4 of the ECLAIRs field of view for z &gt; 12). The ECLAIRs low-energy threshold of 4 keV, contributes to this great detection capability, as it may enhance it at high redshift (z &gt; 10) by over 10% compared to a 15 keV low-energy threshold. We also show that the detection of GRBs at high-z values may imprint tip-of-the-iceberg biases on the GRB duration measurements, which can affect the reconstruction of other source properties.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Roche problem for stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, we use the tensor virial equations to show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>

      <title>Photon ring autocorrelations from gravitational fluctuations around a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The images of supermassive black holes in M87 and our galaxy captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) might open up a new way for exploring black hole physics at the horizon scale. Theoretically, this could provide insights into studying the emission sources around a black hole or the geometries of the black hole itself. This paper investigates the two-point correlations of intensity fluctuations on the photon ring, resulting from the existence of shock waves or gravitational fluctuations around a black hole. Following approaches used in the field of gravitational wave detectors, we introduce response functions of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for detecting gravitational fluctuations and study the shape of the overlap reduction functions. It is found that the shape of the correlations here differs from that resulting from stochastic emission sources. By providing an order-of-magnitude estimate for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we obtain sensitivity curves for the detection of gravitational fluctuations. This might reveal the potential for detecting gravitational fluctuations with future VLBI observations in the LIGO frequency band.</description>

      <title>XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN constraints on DSNB-boosted dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scenario in which dark matter particles are accelerated to semi-relativistic velocities through their scattering with the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background. Such a subdominant, but more energetic dark matter component can be then detected via its scattering on the electrons and nucleons inside direct detection experiments. This opens up the possibility to probe the sub-GeV mass range, a region of parameter space that is usually not accessible at such facilities. We analyze current data from the XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN experiments and we obtain novel constraints on the scattering cross sections of sub-GeV boosted dark matter with both nucleons and electrons. We also highlight the importance of carefully taking into account Earth's attenuation effects as well as the finite nuclear size into the analysis. By comparing our results to other existing constraints, we show that these effects lead to improved and more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar-system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural network-based real-bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the "big data" era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Calibrating signal-to-noise ratio detection thresholds using gravitational-wave catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational-wave signals is a challenging and computationally intensive endeavor undertaken by multiple independent analysis pipelines. While detection depends only on observed noisy data, it is sometimes inconsistently defined in terms of source parameters that in reality are unknown, e.g., by placing a threshold on the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present a method to calibrate unphysical thresholds to search results by performing Bayesian inference on real observations using a model that simultaneously parametrizes the intrinsic network optimal SNR distribution and the effect of search sensitivity on it. We find consistency with a fourth-order power law and detection thresholds of $10.5_{-2.4}^{+2.1}$, $11.2_{-1.4}^{+1.2}$, and $9.1_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ (medians and $90\%$ credible intervals) for events with false-alarm rates less than $1\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the first, second, and third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, respectively. Though event selection can only be self-consistently reproduced by physical searches, employing our inferred thresholds allows approximate observation-calibrated selection criteria to be applied when efficiency is required and injection campaigns are infeasible.</description>

      <title>Constraints on metastable superheavy dark matter coupled to sterile neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter particles could be superheavy, provided their lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe. Using the sensitivity of the Pierre Auger Observatory to ultra-high energy neutrinos and photons, we constrain a specific extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that meets the lifetime requirement for a superheavy particle by coupling it to a sector of ultra-light sterile neutrinos. Our results show that, for a typical dark coupling constant of 0.1, the mixing angle $\theta_m$ between active and sterile neutrinos must satisfy, roughly, $\theta_m \lesssim 1.5\times 10^{-6}(M_X/10^9~\mathrm{GeV})^{-2}$ for a mass $M_X$ of the dark-matter particle between $10^8$ and $10^{11}~$GeV.</description>

      <title>Boosted Dark Matter From Centaurus A and Its Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter can be boosted by high energy particles in astrophysical environments through elastic scattering. We study the production of boosted dark matter via scattering with electrons in the relativistic jet of the closest active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A, and its detection in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Since there are a huge number of electrons in the jet and dark matter is extremely dense around the supermassive black hole that powers the jet, the number of boosted dark matter is tremendously large. Compared to boosted dark matter from blazars, the dark matter flux from Centaurus A is enhanced due to the proximity of Centaurus A. The constraint on dark matter-electron scattering cross section set by Super-Kamiokande is more stringent, down to $\sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{cm}^2$ for $\mathrm{MeV}$ dark matter.</description>
