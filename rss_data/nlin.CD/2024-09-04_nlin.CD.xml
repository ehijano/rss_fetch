      <title>Noise-induced order in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise-induced phenomena in high-dimensional dynamical systems were investigated from a random dynamical systems point of view. In a class of generalized H\'enon maps, which are randomly perturbed delayed logistic maps, with monotonically increasing noise levels, we observed (i) an increase in the number of positive Lyapunov exponents from 4 to 5, and the emergence of characteristic periods at the same time, and (ii) a decrease in the number of positive Lyapunov exponents from 4 to 3, and an increase in Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy at the same time. Our results imply that simple concepts of noise-induced phenomena, such as noise-induced chaos and/or noise-induced order, may not describe those analogue in high dimensional dynamical systems, owing to coexistence of noise-induced chaos and noise-induced order.</description>

      <title>Inertial Particle Dynamics in Traveling Wave Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of inertial particles in fluid flows have been the focus of extensive research due to their relevance in a wide range of industrial and environmental processes. Earlier studies have examined the dynamics of aerosols and bubbles using the Maxey-Riley equation in some standard systems but their dynamics within the traveling wave flow remain unexplored. In this paper, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of inertial particles in the traveling wave flow which shows mixing, and segregation in phase space as well as the formation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). We first obtain the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLEs) for the base fluid flow defined by the traveling wave flow using the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. Further, we extend our calculations to the inertial particles to get the inertial finite-time Lyapunov exponent (iFTLEs). Our findings reveal that heavier inertial particles tend to be attracted to the ridges of the FTLE fields, while lighter particles are repelled. By understanding how material elements in a flow separate and stretch, one can predict pollutant dispersion, optimize the mixing process, and improve navigation and tracking in fluid environments. This provides insights into the complex and non-intuitive behavior of inertial particles in chaotic fluid flows, and may have implications for pollutant transport in wide-ranging fields such as atmospheric and oceanic sciences.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of coupled oscillators under the shear-velocity boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic and stochastic coupled oscillators with inertia are studied on the rectangular lattice under the shear-velocity boundary condition. Our coupled oscillator model exhibits various nontrivial phenomena and there are various relationships with wide research areas such as the coupled limit-cycle oscillators, the dislocation theory, a block-spring model of earthquakes, and the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. We show numerically several unique nonequilibrium properties of the coupled oscillators. We find that the spatial profiles of the average value and variance of the velocity become non-uniform when the dissipation rate is large. The probability distribution of the velocity sometimes deviates from the Gaussian distribution. The time evolution of kinetic energy becomes intermittent when the shear rate is small and the temperature is small but not zero. The intermittent jumps of the kinetic energy cause a long tail in the velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continue to puzzle scholars, due to their elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order interactions greatly promote the onset of chimera states, which are easier to found and more resilient when the system units interact in group. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for their control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic Chaos Unveiling Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quorum sensing orchestrates bacterial communication, which is vital for bacteria's population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that unveils chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, challenging predictability. The model considers the interaction between autoinducers (molecular signalling) and two subtypes of bacteria. We analyze the different dynamical scenarios to find parameter regimes for long-term steady-state behaviour, periodic oscillations, and even chaos. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Delay Parameter Selection in Permutation Entropy Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy (PE) is a powerful tool for quantifying the complexity of a signal which includes measuring the regularity of a time series. Additionally, outside of entropy and information theory, permutations have recently been leveraged as a graph representation, which opens the door for graph theory tools and analysis. Despite the successful application of permutations in a variety of scientific domains, permutations requires a judicious choice of the delay parameter $\tau$ and dimension $n$. However, $n$ is typically selected within an accepted range giving optimal results for the majority of systems. Therefore, in this work we focus on choosing the delay parameter, while giving some general guidance on the appropriate selection of $n$ based on a statistical analysis of the permutation distribution. Selecting $\tau$ is often accomplished using trial and error guided by the expertise of domain scientists. However, in this paper, we show how persistent homology, a commonly used tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), provides methods for the automatic selection of $\tau$. We evaluate the successful identification of a suitable $\tau$ from our TDA-based approach by comparing our results to both expert suggested parameters from published literature and optimized parameters (if possible) for a wide variety of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The heteroclinic orbit is shown to be robust and to result from a 1:2 mode interaction. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>
