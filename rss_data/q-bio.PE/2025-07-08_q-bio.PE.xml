      <title>Mono and Polyauxic Growth Kinetic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of microbial growth curves is essential for understanding and optimizing bioprocesses in biotechnology and environmental engineering. While classical monoauxic models such as Monod, Boltzmann, and Gompertz are widely used, they often lack biological interpretability or fail to capture the complex, multiphasic growth patterns observed in systems with mixed substrates or microbial communities. This paper presents a methodological framework for reparametrizing the Boltzmann and Gompertz equations, assigning direct biological significance to each parameter and enabling their application to both monoauxic and polyauxic (multi-phase) growth scenarios. Polyauxic growth is modeled as a weighted sum of sigmoidal functions, with constraints for model identifiability and biological plausibility. Robust parameter estimation is achieved using a Lorentzian loss function, combined with a global-local optimization strategy (Particle Swarm Optimization and Nelder-Mead), and systematic outlier exclusion using the ROUT method. Model parsimony is enforced via established information criteria. This workflow enables reliable, reproducible, and interpretable extraction of kinetic parameters from complex growth data and is broadly applicable to other fields where sigmoidal patterns are observed.</description>

      <title>Metrics for classes of semi-binary phylogenetic networks using $\mu$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

      <title>Why is it easier to predict the epidemic curve than to reconstruct the underlying contact network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model on weighted graphs. In their numerical study [10] van Mieghem et al. have shown that it is possible to learn an estimated network from a finite time sample of the trajectories of the dynamics that in turn can give an accurate prediction beyond the sample time range, even though the estimated network might be qualitatively far from the ground truth. We give a mathematically rigorous derivation for this phenomenon, notably that for large networks, prediction of the epidemic curves is robust, while reconstructing the underlying network is ill-conditioned. Furthermore, we also provide an explicit formula for the underlying network when reconstruction is possible. At the heart of the explanation, we rely on Szemer\'edi's weak regularity lemma.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are 'closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that each member of a broad class of Markovian population models induces a unique stochastic process on the space of genealogies. We construct this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of a filter equation, the structure of which is completely determined by the population model. We show that existing phylodynamic methods based on either the coalescent or the linear birth-death processes are special cases. We derive some properties of filter equations and describe a class of algorithms that can be used to numerically solve them. Our results open the door to statistically efficient likelihood-based phylodynamic inference for a much wider class of models than is currently possible.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>
