      <title>Quantum transport under oscillatory drive with disordered amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of non-interacting particles in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain in the presence of an electric field with random amplitude drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and explicitly focus on the nature of quantum transport. We derive an exact expression for the probability propagator and the mean-squared displacement in the clean limit and generalize it for the disordered case using the Liouville operator method. Our analysis reveals that in the presence a random static field, the system follows diffusive transport; however, an increase in the field strength causes a suppression in the transport and thus results in disorder-induced localization. We further extend the analysis for a time-dependent disordered electric field and show that the dynamics of mean-squared-displacement deviates from the parabolic path as the field strength increases, unlike the clean limit where ballistic transport occurs.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>A cost-effective strategy of enhancing machine learning potentials by transfer learning from a multicomponent dataset on {\ae}net-PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer efficient and accurate material simulations, but constructing the reference ab initio database remains a significant challenge, particularly for catalyst-adsorbate systems. Training an MLP with a small dataset can lead to overfitting, thus limiting its practical applications. This study explores the feasibility of developing computationally cost-effective and accurate MLPs for catalyst-adsorbate systems with a limited number of ab initio references by leveraging a transfer learning strategy from subsets of a comprehensive public database. Using the Open Catalyst Project 2020 (OC20) -- a dataset closely related to our system of interest -- we pre-trained MLP models on OC20 subsets using the {\ae}net-PyTorch framework. We compared several strategies for database subset selection. Our findings indicate that MLPs constructed via transfer learning exhibit better generalizability than those constructed from scratch, as demonstrated by the consistency in the dynamics simulations. Remarkably, transfer learning enhances the stability and accuracy of MLPs for the CuAu/H2O system with approximately 600 reference data points. This approach achieved excellent extrapolation performance in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the larger CuAu/6H2O system, sustaining up to 250 ps, whereas MLPs without transfer learning lasted less than 50 ps. We also examine the potential limitations of this strategy. This work proposes an alternative, cost-effective approach for constructing MLPs for the challenging simulation of catalytic systems. Finally, we anticipate that this methodology will pave the way for broader applications in material science and catalysis research, facilitating more efficient and accurate simulations across various systems.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Selecting Relevant Structural Features for Glassy Dynamics by Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Order metrics of jammed solids: Structures, hyperuniformity, and implications for ultra-stable glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of long-range order, it remains challenging to characterize the structure of disordered solids and understand the nature of the glass transition. Here we propose a new structural order parameter by taking into account multiple rotational symmetries. By studying its statistics for two-dimensional disordered packings of hard particles along the jamming transition line, we observe the evolution from disordered-particle-rich states to ordered-particle-rich states with the increase of packing fraction, together with the unusual non-monotonic change of the degree of hyperuniformity. At the high packing fraction end of the jamming transition line, the packings are mostly composed of ordered particles and are nearly hyperuniform beyond a finite length. Our work links the local order fluctuations to the thermodynamic stability and density fluctuations of disordered solids. Taking advantage of the order parameter, we propose the structural characteristic of ultra-stable glasses: Although globally disordered evaluated by any single symmetry, they are rich of ordered particles and effectively `globally ordered' with crystal-like density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of global receptive fields capturing multipartite quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>Continuum mechanics of differential growth in disordered granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered granular matter exhibits mechanical responses that occupy the boundary between fluids and solids, lacking a complete description within a continuum theoretical framework. Recent studies have shown that, in the quasi-static limit, the mechanical response of disordered solids to external perturbations is anomalous and can be accurately predicted by the theory of odd-dipole-screening. In this work, we investigate responsive granular matter, where grains change size in response to stimuli such as humidity, temperature, or other factors. We develop a geometric theory of odd dipole-screening, incorporating the growth field into the equilibrium equation. Our theory predicts an anomalous displacement field in response to non-uniform growth fields, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of granular matter. Although the screening parameters in our theory are phenomenological and not derived from microscopic physics, we identify a surprising relationship between the odd parameter and Poissons ratio. This theory has implications for various experimental protocols, including non-uniform heating or wetting, which lead to spatially varying expansion field.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 1D quantum Heisenberg chain with randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings (a model previously studied by approximate strong-disorder RG). We find that, at least for sufficiently large spin $S$, the ground state has ``spin glass'' order. The spin waves on top of this state have the dynamical exponent ${z=3/2}$, intermediate between the values $z=1$ of the antiferromagnet and ${z=2}$ of the ferromagnet. DMRG simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results for spins ${S=1}$ and ${S=3/2}$. The case ${S=1/2}$ shows large finite size effects: we suggest that this case is also ordered, but with a small ordered moment.</description>

      <title>Local and nonlocal stochastic control of quantum chaos: Measurement- and control-induced criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the topology of the phase diagram of a family of quantum models inspired by the classical Bernoulli map under stochastic control. The quantum models inherit a control-induced phase transition from the classical model and also manifest an entanglement phase transition intrinsic to the quantum setting. This measurement-induced phase transition has been shown in various settings to either coincide or split off from the control transition, but a systematic understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two transitions to coincide in this case has so far been lacking. In this work, we generalize the control map to allow for either local or global control action. While this does not affect the classical aspects of the control transition that is described by a random walk, it significantly influences the quantum dynamics, leading to the universality class of the measurement-induced transition being dependent on the locality of the control operation. In the presence of a global control map, the two transitions coincide and the control-induced phase transition dominates the measurement-induced phase transition. Contrarily, the two transitions split in the presence of the local control map or additional projective measurements and generically take on distinct universality classes. For local control, the measurement-induced phase transition recovers the Haar logarithmic conformal field theory universality class found in feedback-free models. However, for global control, a novel universality class with correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 0.7$ emerges from the interplay of control and projective measurements. This work provides a more refined understanding of the relationship between the control- and measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of compressed sensing with $\ell_0$-norm regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noiseless compressive sensing is a two-steps setting that allows for undersampling a sparse signal and then reconstructing it without loss of information. The LASSO algorithm, based on $\lone$ regularization, provides an efficient and robust to address this problem, but it fails in the regime of very high compression rate. Here we present two algorithms based on $\lzero$-norm regularization instead that outperform the LASSO in terms of compression rate in the Gaussian design setting for measurement matrix. These algorithms are based on the Approximate Survey Propagation, an algorithmic family within the Approximate Message Passing class. In the large system limit, they can be rigorously tracked through State Evolution equations and it is possible to exactly predict the range compression rates for which perfect signal reconstruction is possible. We also provide a statistical physics analysis of the $\lzero$-norm noiseless compressive sensing model. We show the existence of both a replica symmetric state and a 1-step replica symmmetry broken (1RSB) state for sufficiently low $\lzero$-norm regularization. The recovery limits of our algorithms are linked to the behavior of the 1RSB solution.</description>
