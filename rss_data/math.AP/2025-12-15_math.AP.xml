      <title>Uniqueness of solutions in high-energy x-ray based `eigenstrain tomography' and other inverse eigenstrain problems: Counter examples and necessary conditions for well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstrain tomography combines diffraction-based strain measurement with elasticity theory to reconstruct full three-dimensional residual stress fields within solids. Notwithstanding a number of recent examples, the uniqueness of such reconstructions has not yet been clearly established. In this paper, we examine the underlying inverse problem in detail and construct explicit counterexamples demonstrating non-uniqueness for a recent implementation of x-ray eigenstrain tomography involving reconstruction from a single measured component of strain. We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components. We further prove two key results related to eigenstrain reconstruction in a general sense; 1. That any possible residual stress field can be generated by a diagonal eigenstrain and 2. That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains. Together, these findings establish rigorous minimum experimental and computational requirements for well-posed eigenstrain tomography techniques and inverse eigenstrain problems in general.</description>

      <title>Two phase micropolar fluid flow with nonlocal energies: Existence theory, nonpolar limits and nonlocal-to-local convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal variant of a thermodynamically consistent phase field model for binary mixtures of micropolar fluids, i.e., fluids exhibiting internal rotations. The model is described by a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard system that extends the earlier nonlocal variants of the model introduced by Abels, Garcke and Gr\"un for binary Newtonian fluid mixtures with unmatched densities. We establish the global 3D weak existence and global 2D strong well-posedness, followed by the weak convergence of the nonlocal model to its local counterpart as the nonlocal interaction kernel approaches the Dirac delta distribution. In the two dimensional setting we provide consistency estimates between strong solutions of the nonlocal micropolar model and strong solutions of nonlocal variants of the Abels--Garcke--Gr\"un model and Model H.</description>

      <title>The pinning effect of dilute defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Bernoulli free boundary problem with ``defects", inhomogeneities in the coefficients of compact support. When the defects are small and arrayed periodically there exist plane-like solutions with a range of large-scale slopes slightly different from the background field value. This is known as pinning. By studying the capacity-like pinning effect of a single defect in the Bernoulli free boundary problem, we can compute the asymptotic expansion of the interval of pinned slopes as the defect size goes to zero for lattice aligned normal directions. Our work is motivated by the issue of contact angle hysteresis in capillary contact lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove large-data scattering in $H^1$ for inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in two space dimensions for all powers $p&gt;0$. We assume the inhomogeneity is nonnegative and repulsive; we additionally require decay at infinity in the case $0&lt;p\leq 2$. We use the method of concentration-compactness and contradiction. We preclude the existence of compact solutions using a Morawetz estimate in the style of Nakanishi.</description>

      <title>Pseudomeasure distributions for nonseparable, nonlocal mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a number of important mean field games models, the Hamiltonian is non-local and not additively separable. This means that the distribution of agents appears in the Hamiltonian only in an integral over the whole spatial domain. For mean field games with a class of such Hamiltonians, we prove existence of solutions for the mean field games system of partial differential equations, allowing pseudomeasure data for the distribution of agents. Specifically, this allows the initial distribution of agents to be a sum of Dirac masses. The existence theorem requires a smallness condition on the size of the terminal data for the value function (or, alternatively, on the size of the Hamiltonian); no smallness condition on the size of the initial data or on the size of the time horizon is required. We also prove uniqueness and continuous dependence results under the same type of smallness conditions. We prove continuous dependence under two complementary hypotheses on the initial data: strong convergence of a sequence of pseudomeasures, and weak-$*$ convergence of a sequence of bounded measures.</description>

      <title>The incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations: global well-posedness and inviscid limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global well-posedness and inviscid limit are investigated for the fluid-particle interaction system, described by the Navier-Stokes equations for the inhomogeneous incompressible viscous flows coupled with the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for particles through a density-dependent nonlinear friction force in three-dimensional space. It is challenging to establish the inviscid limit over large time periods for the incompressible Euler equations under the influence of the weak dissipative mechanism generated by the friction force. We first prove the global stability of the equilibrium, in the sense that initial perturbations with appropriate Besov spatial regularity lead to global well-posedness and uniform regularity estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for strong solutions of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. In particular, we establish the optimal rates of convergence to equilibrium uniformly in Navier-Stokes. Then, we construct global solutions to the inhomogeneous Euler-Fokker-Planck equations via the vanishing viscosity limit. Furthermore, by capturing the dissipation arising from two-phase interactions, we rigorously justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the inviscid limit process, with a convergence rate that is in sharp contrast to that in the pure incompressible fluid case. To achieve this global convergence, novel ideas and new techniques are developed in the analysis and may be applied to other significant problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with spectral estimates for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the degenerate $p$-Laplace operator in bounded simply connected domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb C$. The proposed approach relies on the conformal analysis of the elliptic operators, which allows us to obtain spectral estimates in domains with non-rectifiable boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry breaking in magnetic thin films stabilizes new families of topological solitons that are absent in conventional anisotropic ferromagnets. Beyond the classical chiral skyrmion, which arises in uniaxial systems through the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, dipolar configurations known as chiral bimerons emerge in easy--plane situations. On compact domains, these solitonic states appear as localized concentrations of energy embedded in an easy--plane background. The analysis, inspired by the Sacks--Uhlenbeck theory for approximate harmonic maps, combines blow--up methods with quantitative rigidity for the M\"obius group to describe the structure, scaling behaviour, and asymptotic limits of such magnetic solitons in both the conformal and large--domain regimes.</description>

      <title>Stratification of the Helffer-Nourrigat cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a singular filtration on a manifold, e.g. a subriemannian setting, one can understand the elliptic regularity problems through a special kind of calculus. The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients.</description>

      <title>A deterministic particle approximation for a fourth-order equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a deterministic particle approximation to a fourth order equation with applications in cell-cell adhesion. In order to do that, first we show that the equation can be asymptotically obtained as a limit from a class of well-posed nonlocal partial differential equations. These latter have the advantage that the particles' empirical measure naturally satisfies the equation. Afterwards, we obtain stability of the 2-Wasserstein gradient flow of this family of nonlocal equations that we use in order to recover a deterministic particle approximation of the fourth order equation. Up to our knowledge, in this manuscript we derive the first deterministic particle approximation for a fourth-order partial differential equation. Finally, we give some numerical simulations of the model at the particles level.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a mixed local-nonlocal $p$-Laplace equation on the Heisenberg group, where the nonlinear term features a variable singular exponent. Our analysis establishes the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of weak solutions under suitable structural assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first treatment of such mixed local-nonlocal problems in a non-commutative setting, even in the linear case $p=2$ with a constant singular exponent.</description>

      <title>On mixed local-nonlocal Sobolev-type inequalities and their connection with singular equations in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a mixed local--nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality in the Heisenberg group and demonstrate that its extremals coincide with solutions to the corresponding mixed local--nonlocal singular $p$-Laplace equations. We further show that these inequalities serve as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of weak solutions to the associated singular problems. Notably, the same characterization remains valid in both the purely local and purely nonlocal settings. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking the existence theory for singular equations across local, nonlocal, and mixed regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of Fokker-Planck equations with spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear diffusion, based on the energy dissipation law. First, we consider the Fokker-Planck equation with porous-medium-type nonlinear diffusion that satisfies the energy dissipation law by introducing spatial inhomogeneity into the free energy. We obtain a result on the long-time behavior of the dissipation function for sufficiently large diffusion coefficients by extending the entropy dissipation method to the case of inhomogeneous diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of a system of nonlinear reaction--diffusion--advection equations in a domain consisting of two bulk regions connected via microscopic channels distributed within a thin membrane. Both the width of the channels and the thickness of the membrane are of order $\varepsilon \ll 1$, and the geometry evolves in time in an a priori known way.
  We consider nonlinear flux boundary conditions at the lateral boundaries of the channels and critical scaling of the diffusion inside the layer. Extending the method of homogenisation in domains with evolving microstructure to thin layers, we employ two-scale convergence and unfolding techniques in thin layers to derive an effective model in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, in which the membrane is reduced to a lower-dimensional interface. We obtain jump conditions for the solution and the total fluxes, which involve the solutions of local, space--time-dependent cell problems in the reference channel.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the spectral stability of monotone, stationary front solutions for reaction-diffusion equations where the reaction function is of Nagumo (or bistable) type and with diffusion coefficients which are density dependent and degenerate at zero (one of the equilibrium points of the reaction). These stationary profiles connect the non-degenerate equilibrium point with the degenerate state at zero, they are monotone, and arrive to the degenerate state at a finite point. They are neither sharp nor smooth. The degeneracy of the diffusion precludes the application of standard techniques to locate the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave in the energy space $L^2$. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the spectrum, the analysis of singular sequences, a generalized convergence of operators technique and refined energy estimates. It is shown that the $L^2$-spectrum of the linearized operator around the front is real and with a spectral gap, that is, a positive distance between the imaginary axis and the rest of the spectrum, with the exception of the origin. Moreover, the origin is a simple isolated eigenvalue, associated to the derivative of the profile as eigenfunction (the translation eigenvalue). Finally, it is shown that the linearization generates an analytic semigroup that decays exponentially outside a one-dimensional eigenspace associated to the zero eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>The Gevrey class of the Euler-Bernoulli beam model with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler-Bernoulli beam model with singularities at the points $x=\xi_1$, $x=\xi_2$ and with localized viscoelastic dissipation of Kelvin-Voigt type. We assume that the beam is composed by two materials; one is an elastic material and the other one is a viscoelastic material of Kelvin-Voigt type.
  Our main result is that the corresponding semigroup is immediately differentiable and also of Gevrey class $4$.
  In particular, our result implies that the model is exponentially stable, has the linear stability property, and the smoothing effect property over the initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the distance function to the boundary of a domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with respect to the Minkowski functional of a convex polytope. We obtain the regularity of the distance function in certain cases. We also explicitly compute the distance function in a collection of examples and observe the new interesting phenomena that arise for such distance functions.</description>

      <title>What is the optimal way to lie? From microscopic to kinetic descriptions of consensus control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an approach for consensus control of opinion dynamics by introducing a liar to the classical system. The liar's aim is to steer the population towards consensus at their goal opinion by showing 'apparent opinions', or 'lies', to members of the population. We analyse this as an optimal control problem for how best to lie to a population in order to guarantee the consensus that the liar desires. We consider a range of regularisations, each motivated by some social convention, such as the liar wanting to present an opinion close to their true opinion. For each regularisation, we demonstrate the effect of instantaneous controls. Furthermore, we introduce a Boltzmann-type description for the corresponding kinetic system and present analysis and numerical results for the resulting Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of Hardy-Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the critical Hardy-Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta_{p}u = \frac{u^{p^{*}_s-1}}{|x|^{s}}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} where $p^{*}_s = \frac{(n-s)p}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Hardy-Sobolev exponent. We classify the positive solutions of this equation for $0 &lt; s &lt; \frac{p-1}{p}$ and $\frac{(2s+n+1)+\sqrt{(2s+n+1)^2-12s}}{6} \leq p &lt; n$ without finite volume constraints, which extends Ou's result in \cite{9} in the literature. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of critical anisotropic Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all positive solutions of the critical anisotropic Sobolev equation \begin{equation}\label{0.1} -\Delta^{H}_{p}u = u^{p^{*}-1}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation} without the finite volume constraint for $n \geq 3$ and $p_n(\Lambda) &lt; p &lt; n$, where $p^{*} = \frac{np}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent, $-\Delta^{H}_{p}=-div(H^{p-1}(\cdot)\nabla H(\cdot))$ denotes the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator and $\Lambda = \lambda\max\limits_{\substack{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n\\1 \leq i, j \leq n}}\left\{\frac{|\xi|^{2}(\nabla^{2}_{ij}H^{p}(\xi))} {p(p-1)H^{p}(\xi)}\right\}$. By employing a novel approach based on invariant tensors technique, and using a Kato-type inequality, we prove that the positive solutions of \eqref{0.1} can be classified for $p_n(\Lambda) \leq p &lt; n$, where $p_n(\Lambda)$ depends explicitly on $\Lambda$. This result removes the finite volume assumption on the classification of critical anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation which was obtained by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in the literature \cite{CFR}. In particular, this results capture the precise dependence of critical exponents $p$ on both $n$ and $\Lambda$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Li and Zhao [5] (Bull. Math. Biol., 83(5), 43, 25 pp (2021)) proposed and studied a periodic reaction-diffusion model of Zika virus with seasonality and spatial heterogeneous structure in host and vector populations. They found the basic reproduction ratio R0, which is a threshold parameter. In this short paper we shall use the upper and lower solutions method to study the model of [5] with Neumann boundary conditions replaced by general boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Riesz transform and its reverse inequality on manifolds with quadratically decaying curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Riesz and reverse Riesz inequalities on manifolds whose Ricci curvature decays quadratically. First, we refine existing results on the boundedness of the Riesz transform by establishing a Lorentz-type endpoint estimate. Next, we explore the relationship between the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms, proving that the reverse Riesz, Hardy, and weighted Sobolev inequalities are essentially equivalent. Finally, we apply our methods to Grushin spaces, which exhibit a quadratic decay in 'Ricci curvature', verifying that the reverse inequality holds for all $p\in (1,\infty)$ and that the Riesz transform is bounded on $L^p$ for $p\in (1,n)$. Our approach relies on an asymptotic formula for the Riesz potential combined with an extension of the so-called harmonic annihilation method.</description>

      <title>Large field problem in coercive singular PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a priori estimates for singular differential equations of the form \[ \mathcal{L} \phi = P(\phi,\nabla\phi) + f(\phi,\nabla\phi)\xi \] where $P$ is a polynomial, $f$ is a sufficiently well-behaved function, and $\xi$ is an irregular distribution such that the equation is subcritical. The differential operator $\mathcal L$ is either a derivative in time, in which case we interpret the equation using rough path theory, or a heat operator, in which case we interpret the equation using regularity structures. Our only assumption on $P$ is that solutions with $\xi=0$ exhibit coercivity. Our estimates are local in space and time, and independent of boundary conditions.
  One of our main results is an abstract estimate that allows one to pass from a local coercivity property to a global one using scaling, for a large class of equations. This allows us to reduce the problem of deriving a priori estimates to the case when $\xi$ is small.</description>

      <title>On a cross-diffusion hybrid model: Cancer Invasion Tissue with Normal Cell Involved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a well-posedness problem on a new mathematical model for cancer invasion within the plasminogen activation system, which explicitly incorporates cooperation with host normal cells. Key biological mechanisms--including chemotaxis, haptotaxis, recruitment, logistic growth, and natural degradation of normal cells--along with other primary components (cancer cells, vitronectin, uPA, uPAI-1 and plasmin) are modeled via a continuum framework of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix. The resulting model constitutes a strongly coupled, cross-diffusion hybrid system of differential equations. The primary mathematical challenges arise from the strongly coupled cross-diffusion terms, the parabolic operators of divergence form, and the interaction between the cross-diffusion fluxes and the ODE components. We address these by deriving several a priori estimates for dimensions d less or equal to 3. Subsequently, we employ a decoupling strategy to split the system into proper sub-problems, establishing the existence (and uniqueness) for each subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate the global existence and uniqueness of the solution for dimensions d less or equal to 2 and the global existence of a solution for dimension d = 3.</description>

      <title>Constructing entire minimal graphs by evolving planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an evolving-plane ansatz for the explicit construction of entire minimal graphs of dimension $n$ ($n\geq 3$) and codimension $m$ ($m\geq 2$), for any odd integer $n$. Under this ansatz, the minimal surface system reduces to the geodesic equation on the Grassmannian in affine coordinates. Geometrically, this equation dictates how the slope of an $(n-1)$ plane evolves as it sweeps out a minimal graph. This framework yields a rich family of explicit entire minimal graphs of odd dimension $n$ and arbitrary codimension $m$. For each entire minimal graph, its conormal bundle gives rise to an entire special Lagrangian graph in $\mathbb{C}^{n+m}$.</description>
