      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Pump-probe studies of resonantly saturated selective reflection from high-density rubidium vapor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear selective reflection from the interface YAG window-high density rubidium vapor in the high-temperature cell is studied at the transition 5S$_{1/2}$-5P$_{3/2}$. In the experiment tunable pump and probe lasers are used. The selective reflection spectra for the laser probe beam are investigated at four different rubidium atomic densities and five different pump beam intensities. The estimated dipole-dipole interaction-induced line broadening varies from $13.2$ to $39.6$ GHz, the measured pumped intensities change from $1.2$ to $8.8$ kW$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. Growth of the pump intensity causes reduction of the magnitude and the width of the recorded selective reflection resonance. We suggest developing all-optical modulators on the basis of nonlinear selective reflection.</description>

      <title>A method of laser frequency stabilization based on the effect of linear dichroism in alkali metal vapors in a modulated transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method of laser frequency stabilization based on the linear dichroism signal in a transverse magnetic field. The method is similar to the DAVLL (Dichroic Atomic Vapor Laser Lock) method. It differs from DAVLL and from its existing modifications primarily by the fact that it uses signal of linearly polarized light caused by alignment, rather than circular refraction caused by orientation, and therefore allows to obtain error signals at the magnetic field modulation frequency (or its second harmonic) by extremely simple means. The method does not require the strong magnetic fields or careful shielding of the working cell. The method allows the laser frequency to be stabilized in the vicinity of the low-frequency transition in the D1 line of Cs. Although the absorption line in a gas-filled cell is typically gigahertz wide, the achievable resolution, limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of photon shot noise, can reach tens of kilohertz in one hertz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cesium $8\,^2P_{J}\rightarrow 6\,^2P_{J'}$ electric quadrupole transition probabilities using fluorescence spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectra of the $8P_{J} \rightarrow 6P_{J'}$ ($J$ and $J'$ = 3/2, 1/2) electric quadrupole transition of cesium atoms have been observed with a heated cesium vapor cell. We determined the ratio of the transition probabilities of $8P_{J}\rightarrow6P_{J'}$ to $8P_{J}\rightarrow5D_{3/2}$ by comparing their respective photon emission rates. The results are in good agreement with our theoretical calculations. These measurements provide crucial parameters for tests of coherent amplification method and improve knowledge of cesium properties which are essential to dark matter detection through atomic transitions.</description>

      <title>Radiative decay of muonic molecules in resonance states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we theoretically investigated x-ray spectra from the radiative decay of muonic deuterium molecules dd$\mu$ in resonance states, which plays an important role in a new kinetic model of muon catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF). The resonance states are Feshbach resonances located below the d$\mu$($n=2$) + d threshold energy and radiatively decay into the continuum or bound states. The x-ray spectra having characteristic shapes according to the radial distribution of the two nuclei are obtained using precise three-body wave functions. We carefully examined the convergence of the x-ray spectra and achieved agreements between the length- and velocity-gauge calculations. We revealed a non-adiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay results in epithermal muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch that directly results in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states dd$\mu^\ast$ and dt$\mu^\ast$ are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The direct formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the $\mu$CF cycle which skips a slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the $\mu$CF cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of $1.5$--$1.997$ keV, close to the K$\alpha$ x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic hydrogen atoms, recently developed state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.</description>

      <title>An atomic boson sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A boson sampler implements a restricted model of quantum computing. It is defined by the ability to sample from the distribution resulting from the interference of identical bosons propagating according to programmable, non-interacting dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a new combination of tools for implementing boson sampling using ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional, tunnel-coupled optical lattice. These tools include fast and programmable preparation of large ensembles of nearly identical bosonic atoms ($99.5^{+0.5}_{-1.6}\;\%$ indistinguishability) by means of rearrangement with optical tweezers and high-fidelity optical cooling, propagation for variable evolution time in the lattice with low loss ($5.0(2)\;\%$, independent of evolution time), and high fidelity detection of the atom positions after their evolution (typically $99.8(1)\;\%$). With this system, we study specific instances of boson sampling involving up to $180$ atoms distributed among $\sim 1000$ sites in the lattice. Direct verification of a given boson sampling distribution is not feasible in this regime. Instead, we introduce and perform targeted tests to determine the indistinguishability of the prepared atoms, to characterize the applied family of single particle unitaries, and to observe expected bunching features due to interference for a large range of atom numbers. When extended to interacting systems, our work demonstrates the core capabilities required to directly assemble ground and excited states in simulations of various Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>
