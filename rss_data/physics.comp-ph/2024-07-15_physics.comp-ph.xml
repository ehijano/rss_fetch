      <title>Conservative Closures of the Vlasov-Poisson Equations Discretized with a Symmetrically Weighted Hermite Spectral Expansion in Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive conservative closures of the Vlasov-Poisson equations discretized in velocity via the symmetrically weighted Hermite spectral expansion. The short note analyzes the conservative closures preservation of the hyperbolicity and anti-symmetry of the Vlasov equation. Furthermore, we verify numerically the analytically derived conservative closures on simulating a classic electrostatic benchmark problem: the Langmuir wave. The numerical results and analytic analysis show that the closure by truncation is the most suitable conservative closure for the symmetrically weighted Hermite formulation.</description>

      <title>Introducing GPU-acceleration into the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of GPU4PySCF, a module that provides GPU acceleration of methods in PySCF. As a core functionality, this provides a GPU implementation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) for contracted basis sets comprising up to g functions using Rys quadrature. As an illustration of how this can accelerate a quantum chemistry workflow, we describe how to use the ERIs efficiently in the integral-direct Hartree-Fock Fock build and nuclear gradient construction. Benchmark calculations show a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude with respect to the multi-threaded CPU Hartree-Fock code of PySCF, and performance comparable to other GPU-accelerated quantum chemical packages including GAMESS and QUICK on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Reduced-Order Gas-Phase Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling using Ensemble SINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification during atmospheric chemistry modeling is computationally expensive as it typically requires a large number of simulations using complex models. As large-scale modeling is typically performed with simplified chemical mechanisms for computational tractability, we describe a probabilistic surrogate modeling method using principal components analysis (PCA) and Ensemble Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (E-SINDy) to both automatically simplify a gas-phase chemistry mechanism and to quantify the uncertainty introduced when doing so. We demonstrate the application of this method on a small photochemical box model for ozone formation. With 100 ensemble members, the calibration $R$-squared value is 0.96 among the three latent species on average and 0.98 for ozone, demonstrating that predicted model uncertainty aligns well with actual model error. In addition to uncertainty quantification, this probabilistic method also improves accuracy as compared to an equivalent deterministic version, by $\sim$60% for the ensemble prediction mean or $\sim$50% for deterministic prediction by the best-performing single ensemble member. Overall, the ozone testing root mean square error (RMSE) is 15.1% of its root mean square (RMS) concentration. Although our probabilistic ensemble simulation ends up being slower than the reference model it emulates, we expect that use of a more complex reference model in future work will result in additional opportunities for acceleration. Versions of this approach applied to full-scale chemical mechanisms may result in improved uncertainty quantification in models of atmospheric composition, leading to enhanced atmospheric understanding and improved support for air quality control and regulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop meanfield approximation and numerical quadrature schemes for the evaluation of Angular-Dependent interatomic Potentials (ADPs) for magnesium and magnesium hydrides at finite temperature (thermalization) and arbitrary atomic molar fractions (mixing) within a non-equilibrium statistical mechanical framework and derive local equilibrium relations. We numerically verify and experimentally validate the accuracy and fidelity of the resulting thermalized/mixed ADPs (TADPs) by means of selected numerical tests including free entropy, heat capacity, thermal expansion, molar volumes, equation of state and elastic constants. We show that the local equilibrium properties predicted by TADPs agree closely with those computed directly from ADP by means of Molecular Dynamics (MD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under various external perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time TDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>DeepCSNet: a deep learning method for predicting electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-impact ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules are essential for plasma modeling, yet their acquisition remains challenging. Experimental measurements often face difficulties due to particle instability, and ab initio calculations become computationally prohibitive as molecular complexity increases. Existing AI-based prediction methods suffer from limited data availability and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose DeepCSNet, a deep learning approach designed to predict electron-impact ionization cross sections using minimal training data. We present two configurations of DeepCSNet: one tailored for specific molecules and another for various molecules. Our numerical results, focusing on electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections, demonstrate DeepCSNet's superior generalization ability, accurately predicting cross sections across a wide range of energies and incident angles. Additionally, DeepCSNet shows promising results in predicting cross sections for previously unencountered molecules, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic electromagnetic problems with material coefficients represented by elliptic fields, covering a wide range of complex and anisotropic material media. The properties of elliptic fields are analyzed, with particular emphasis on scalar fields and normal tensor fields. Time-harmonic electromagnetic problems with general elliptic material fields are then studied. Well-posedness results for classical variational formulations with different boundary conditions are reviewed, and hypotheses for the coercivity of the corresponding sesquilinear forms are investigated. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to examples of media used in the literature: isotropic lossy media, geometric media, and gyrotropic media.</description>

      <title>Quantized Inverse Design for Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) presents distinctive computational challenges, including their large memory requirements. Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication process introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more flexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D structures with unique properties. This paper presents an efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle several constraints arising from novel fabrication methods. Our method is based on straight-through gradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex structures to solve the coupling problem in integrated photonic circuits. The results highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting doping strategies for ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode materials to enhance battery performance using graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries has spurred considerable interest in advanced battery technologies, particularly those utilizing ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode materials, which are renowned for their robust electrochemical performance and structural stability. Building upon this research, investigators have explored doping additional elements into NCM cathode materials to further enhance their electrochemical performance and structural integrity. However, the multitude of doping strategies available for NCM battery systems presents a challenge in determining the most effective approach. In this study, we elucidate the potential of ternary NCM systems as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. We compile a comprehensive database of lithium-ion batteries employing NCM systems from various sources of prior research and develop a corresponding data-driven model utilizing graph neural networks to predict optimal doping strategies. Our aim is to provide insights into the NCM-based battery systems for both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for transport models in porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>From Structural Stability to Electronic Flexibility: Unveiling Strain-induced Effects in a MoS$_2$/Perylene Orange Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the interaction between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and a single Perylene Orange (PO) molecule, representative of inorganic and organic semiconductor materials, respectively. Investigation of the amalgamation of these materials under mechanical strains reveals significant alterations in the electronic properties of the MoS$_2$/PO interface. Tensile strain induces a reduction in the bandgap, while compressive strain initially engenders an increase, followed by a subsequent decrease. Notably, MoS$_2$ undergoes a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap under both stretching and compression conditions. These alterations stem from shifts in the density of states and band structure adjustments resulting from lattice deformations induced by applied strain. Remarkably, under specific compression conditions, the MoS$_2$/PO system manifests a transition between type II and type I band alignments. The detailed analysis of a range of strain magnitudes yields profound insights into the behavior of MoS$_2$ and MoS$_2$/PO systems under mechanical strain, with potential implications for nano- and optoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Coupling Fluid Plasma and Kinetic Neutral Models using Correlated Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While boundary plasmas in present day tokamaks generally fall in a fluid regime, neutral species near the boundary often require kinetic models due to long mean-free-paths compared to characteristic spatial scales in the region. Monte-Carlo (MC) methods provide a complete, high-fidelity approach to solving kinetic models, and must be coupled to fluid plasma models to simulate the full plasma-neutrals system. The statistical nature of MC methods, however, prevents convergence of coupled fluid-kinetic simulations to an exact self-consistent steady-state. Moreover, this forces the use of explicit methods that can suffer from numerical errors and require huge computational resources.
  Correlated Monte-Carlo (CMC) methods are expected to alleviate these issues, but have historically enjoyed only mixed success. Here, a fully implicit method for coupled plasma-neutral systems is demonstrated in 1D using the UEDGE plasma code and a homemade CMC code. In particular, it is shown that ensuring the CMC method is a differentiable function of the background plasma is sufficient to employ a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov solver for implicit time steps. The convergence of the implicit coupling method is explored and compared with explicit coupling and uncorrelated methods. It is shown that ensuring differentiability by controlling random seeds in the MC is sufficient to achieve convergence, and that the use of implicit time-stepping methods has the potential for improved stability and runtimes over explicit coupling methods.</description>

      <title>Edge Formation Mechanism of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations based on a Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the high potential for applications utilizing the unique properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), the applications remain challenging due to the difficulty of synthesizing SWCNTs with a specific chirality. To elucidate the mechanisms that determine their chirality during growth, intensive efforts have been devoted to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the mechanism of chirality determination has not been fully clarified, which can partly be attributed to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials in reproducing the behavior of carbon and metal atoms. In this work, we develop a neural network potential (NNP) for carbon-metal system to accurately describe the SWCNT growth, and perform MD simulations of SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD simulations demonstrate the process of defect-free chirality-definable SWCNT growth with dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations, and the consistency between the probability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability predicted from the nanotube-catalyst interfacial energy. It is also shown that the edge defect formation is induced by vacancy and suppressed by vacancy healing through adatom diffusion on the SWCNT edges. These results provide insights into the edge formation thermodynamics and kinetics of SWCNTs, an important clue to the chirality-controlled synthesis of SWCNTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12478v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current state of the art for determining thermoelectric properties is limited to the investigation of electrons or phonons without including the inherent electron-phonon coupling that is in all materials. This gives rise to limitations in accurately calculating base material properties that are in good agreement with experimental data. Steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics is a general non-equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble framework that provides a general equation of motion for non-equilibrium system state evolution. This framework utilizes the electron and phonon density of states as input to compute material properties, while taking into account the electron-phonon coupling. It is able to span across multiple spatial and temporal scales in a single analysis. Any system's thermoelectric properties can, therefore, be attained provided the accurately determined density of states is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigation of the magnetic switching and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve elements (SVs) of varying physical parameters such as shape, element size, dimensional aspect ratio, and array size is of vital importance for their application in future magnetic memory and storage devices. We have inspected the magnetic switching mechanism and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale SV elements (Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20) and arrays of these elements, with each layer having a thickness of 10 nm and rectangular and elliptical shapes with varying lateral aspect ratios (ARs) and varying interelement spacing for the arrays, by finite difference method-based micromagnetic simulation. We observe that the elements with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers forming antiparallel states in the plateau, similar to synthetic antiferromagnets. For lower AR, more complex quasi-uniform magnetic microstates are observed, which are even more intricate for elliptical elements. The elliptical elements with an AR of 1.25 show coherent and predictable magnetic switching behaviour, demonstrating their appropriateness for integration into magnetic memory devices. We observe a gradual increase in magnetoresistance (MR%) with the increase in AR and the decrease in interelement spacing. The magnetic flux density experiences a reduction with an increase in the inter-elemental spacing.</description>

      <title>Uplifting edges in higher order networks: spectral centralities for non-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral analysis of networks states that many structural properties of graphs, such as centrality of their nodes, are given in terms of their adjacency matrices. The natural extension of such spectral analysis to higher order networks is strongly limited by the fact that a given hypergraph could have several different adjacency hypermatrices, hence the results obtained so far are mainly restricted to the class of uniform hypergraphs, which leaves many real systems unattended. A new method for analysing non-linear eigenvector-like centrality measures of non-uniform hypergraphs is presented in this paper that could be useful for studying properties of $\mathcal{H}$-eigenvectors and $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors in the non-uniform case. In order to do so, a new operation - the $\textit{uplift}$ - is introduced, incorporating auxiliary nodes in the hypergraph to allow for a uniform-like analysis. We later argue why this is a mathematically sound operation, and we furthermore use it to classify a whole family of hypergraphs with unique Perron-like $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors. We supplement the theoretical analysis with several examples and numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

Abstract: Numerical solution of discrete PDEs corresponding to saddle point problems is highly relevant to physical systems such as Stokes flow. However, scaling up numerical solvers for such systems is often met with challenges in efficiency and convergence. Multigrid is an approach with excellent applicability to elliptic problems such as the Stokes equations, and can be a solution to such challenges of scalability and efficiency. The degree of success of such methods, however, is highly contingent on the design of key components of a multigrid scheme, including the hierarchy of discretizations, and the relaxation scheme used. Additionally, in many practical cases, it may be more effective to use a multigrid scheme as a preconditioner to an iterative Krylov subspace solver, as opposed to striving for maximum efficacy of the relaxation scheme in all foreseeable settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient symmetric multigrid preconditioner for the Stokes Equations on a staggered finite-difference discretization. Our contribution is focused on crafting a preconditioner that (a) is symmetric indefinite, matching the property of the Stokes system itself, (b) is appropriate for preconditioning the SQMR iterative scheme, and (c) has the requisite symmetry properties to be used in this context. In addition, our design is efficient in terms of computational cost and facilitates scaling to large domains.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>

Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Yadism: Yet Another Deep-Inelastic Scattering Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present yadism, a library for the evaluation of both polarized and unpolarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions and cross sections up to N$^3$LO in perturbative QCD. The package provides computations of observables in fixed-flavor and zero-mass variable flavor number schemes. The implementation of the general mass variable flavor number schemes is supported through the high virtuality limits for the heavy flavor coefficients. In addition, yadism provides a set of tools for the generation of interpolation grids in the PDF-independent PineAPPL format, allowing to test the PDF dependence on any DIS observable without needing to rerun the computation. This work is part of an ongoing effort to standardize the format of theory predictions in high-energy physics within the pineline framework. The code is open source, written in Python and documented to facilitate usage, integrations, and further extensions. Finally, the code has been benchmarked against the widely used APFEL++ and QCDNUM libraries.</description>

      <title>Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas from energy storage to solvents, where they have been touted as ``designer solvents'' as they can be mixed to precisely tailor the physiochemical properties. As using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to simulate ILs is still relatively unexplored, several questions need to be answered to see if MLIPs can be transformative for ILs. Since ILs are often not pure, but are either mixed together or contain additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be compositionally transferable, i.e., the MLIP can be applied to mixtures of ions not directly trained on, whilst only being trained on a few mixtures of the same ions. We also investigate the accuracy of MLIPs for a novel IL, which we experimentally synthesize and characterize. Our MLIP trained on $\sim$200 DFT frames is in reasonable agreement with our experiments and DFT.</description>

      <title>A lattice Boltzmann approach for acoustic manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a lattice Boltzmann method to compute the acoustic radiation force produced by standing waves on a compressible object. Instead of simulating the fluid mechanics equations directly, the proposed method uses a lattice Boltzmann model that reproduces the wave equation, together with a kernel interpolation scheme, to compute the first order perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields on the object's surface and, from them, the acoustic radiation force. The procedure reproduces with excellent accuracy the theoretical expressions by Gor'kov and Wei for the sphere and the disk, respectively, even with a modest number of lattice Boltzmann cells. The proposed method shows to be a promising tool for simulating phenomena where the acoustic radiation force plays a relevant role, like acoustic tweezers or the acoustic manipulation of microswimmers, with applications in medicine and engineering.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields: A Framework for Solving Time-dependent Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Exploring parameter dependence of atomic minima with implicit differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential to go beyond ab initio size limitations, but simulation results depend sensitively on potential parameters. Forward propagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification, whilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such as fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions defined as a fixed point is used to Taylor expand the energy and structure of atomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic differentiation, dense linear algebra or a novel sparse operator approach. The latter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures of arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts lattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and machine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation without prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be used to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to fine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at dislocations in tungsten.</description>
