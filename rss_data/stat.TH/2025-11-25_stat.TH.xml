      <title>Divergence-Minimization for Latent-Structure Models: Monotone Operators, Contraction Guarantees, and Robust Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.</description>

      <title>Time-uniform concentration bounds for iterative algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for deriving time-uniform concentration bounds for the output of stochastic sequential algorithms satisfying certain recursive inequalities akin to those defining the almost-supermartingale processes introduced by \cite{robbins1971convergence}. Our approach is of wide applicability, and can be deployed in settings in which exponential supermartingale processes, required by prevailing methodologies for anytime-valid concentration inequalities, are not readily available. Our results can be viewed as quantitative versions of the classical Robbins-Siegmund Lemma. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by providing new and optimal time-uniform concentration bounds for Oja's algorithm for streaming PCA, stochastic gradient descent, and stochastic approximations.</description>

      <title>Multiple change-points detection based on U-Statistics under weak dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiple change-points detection using multi-samples tests based on U-statistics for absolutely regular observations. Our results extend those of Ngatchou-Wandji et al. (2022) concerned with the study of one single changepoint. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics under the null hypothesis and under a sequence of local alternatives are given explicitly, and the tests are shown to be consistent. A small set of simulations is done for evaluating the performance of the tests in detecting multiple changes in the mean, variance and autocorrelation of some simple times series models.</description>

      <title>Matching correlated VAR time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of matching correlated VAR time series databases, where a multivariate time series is observed along with a perturbed and permuted version, and the goal is to recover the unknown matching between them. To model this, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which two time series $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are jointly generated, such that $x^\#_t=x_{\pi^*(t)}+\sigma \tilde{x}_{\pi^*(t)}$, where $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(\tilde{x}_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are independent and identically distributed vector autoregressive (VAR) time series of order $1$ with Gaussian increments, for a hidden $\pi^*$. The objective is to recover $\pi^*$, from the observation of $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$. This generalizes the classical problem of matching independent point clouds to the time series setting.
  We derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to a quadratic optimization over permutations, and theoretically analyze an estimator based on linear assignment. For the latter approach, we establish recovery guarantees, identifying thresholds for $\sigma$ that allow for perfect or partial recovery. Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope). This allows for efficient estimation of $\pi^*$ and the VAR parameters via alternating minimization. Empirically, we find that linear assignment often matches or outperforms MLE relaxation based approaches.</description>

      <title>Estimation of High-dimensional Nonlinear Vector Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models have numerous applications in fields such as econometrics, biology, climatology, among others. While prior research has mainly focused on linear VAR models, these approaches can be restrictive in practice. To address this, we introduce a high-dimensional non-parametric sparse additive model, providing a more flexible framework. Our method employs basis expansions to construct high-dimensional nonlinear VAR models. We derive convergence rates and model selection consistency for least squared estimators, considering dependence measures of the processes, error moment conditions, sparsity, and basis expansions. Our theory significantly extends prior linear VAR models by incorporating both non-Gaussianity and non-linearity. As a key contribution, we derive sharp Bernstein-type inequalities for tail probabilities in both non-sub-Gaussian linear and nonlinear VAR processes, which match the classical Bernstein inequality for independent random variables. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of the nonlinear VAR model for a gene expression time series dataset.</description>

      <title>Joint learning of a network of linear dynamical systems via total variation penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint estimation of the parameters of $m$ linear dynamical systems, given access to single realizations of their respective trajectories, each of length $T$. The linear systems are assumed to reside on the nodes of an undirected and connected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$, and the system matrices are assumed to either vary smoothly or exhibit small number of ``jumps'' across the edges. We consider a total variation penalized least-squares estimator and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) which hold with high probability. In particular, the bounds imply for certain choices of well connected $G$ that the MSE goes to zero as $m$ increases, even when $T$ is constant. The theoretical results are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Solving a Research Problem in Mathematical Statistics with AI Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.
  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Network Data without Metric Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops limit theorems for random variables with network dependence, without requiring that individuals in the network to be located in a Euclidean or metric space. This distinguishes our approach from most existing limit theorems in network econometrics, which are based on weak dependence concepts such as strong mixing, near-epoch dependence, and $\psi$-dependence. By relaxing the assumption of an underlying metric space, our theorems can be applied to a broader range of network data, including financial and social networks. To derive the limit theorems, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (also known as physical dependence) from time series to random variables with network dependence. Using this framework, we establish several inequalities, a law of large numbers, and central limit theorems. Furthermore, we verify the conditions for these limit theorems based on primitive assumptions for spatial autoregressive models, which are widely used in network data analysis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical biomarker thresholding: a model-agnostic framework for stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).</description>

      <title>Differential privacy with dependent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependent data underlies many statistical studies in the social and health sciences, which often involve sensitive or private information. Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\textit{item-level}) and \textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $\mu \in \R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.</description>

      <title>On Instability of Minimax Optimal Optimism-Based Bandit Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.
  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via overparametrized nonconvex optimization: nonsmooth amplitude loss landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonconvex optimization for phase retrieval and the more general problem of semidefinite low-rank matrix sensing; in particular, we focus on the global nonconvex landscape of overparametrized versions of the nonsmooth amplitude least-squares loss as well as a smooth reformulation of this loss based on the PhaseCut approach. We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.</description>

      <title>Product Depth for Temporal Point Processes Observed Only Up to the First k Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) model the timing of discrete events along a timeline and are widely used in fields such as neuroscience and fi- nance. Statistical depth functions are powerful tools for analyzing centrality and ranking in multivariate and functional data, yet existing depth notions for TPPs remain limited. In this paper, we propose a novel product depth specifically designed for TPPs observed only up to the first k events. Our depth function comprises two key components: a normalized marginal depth, which captures the temporal distribution of the final event, and a conditional depth, which characterizes the joint distribution of the preceding events. We establish its key theoretical properties and demonstrate its practical utility through simulation studies and real data applications.</description>

      <title>PTF Testing Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis</title>

Abstract: This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.
  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression with Observed Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference in high-dimensional models</title>

Abstract: Models with dimension more than the available sample size are now commonly used in various applications. A sensible inference is possible using a lower-dimensional structure. In regression problems with a large number of predictors, the model is often assumed to be sparse, with only a few predictors active. Interdependence between a large number of variables is succinctly described by a graphical model, where variables are represented by nodes on a graph and an edge between two nodes is used to indicate their conditional dependence given other variables. Many procedures for making inferences in the high-dimensional setting, typically using penalty functions to induce sparsity in the solution obtained by minimizing a loss function, were developed. Bayesian methods have been proposed for such problems more recently, where the prior takes care of the sparsity structure. These methods have the natural ability to also automatically quantify the uncertainty of the inference through the posterior distribution. Theoretical studies of Bayesian procedures in high-dimension have been carried out recently. Questions that arise are, whether the posterior distribution contracts near the true value of the parameter at the minimax optimal rate, whether the correct lower-dimensional structure is discovered with high posterior probability, and whether a credible region has adequate frequentist coverage. In this paper, we review these properties of Bayesian and related methods for several high-dimensional models such as many normal means problem, linear regression, generalized linear models, Gaussian and non-Gaussian graphical models. Effective computational approaches are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal testing by classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an ML inspired approach to hypothesis testing known as classifier/classification-accuracy testing ($\mathsf{CAT}$). In $\mathsf{CAT}$, one first trains a classifier by feeding it labeled synthetic samples generated by the null and alternative distributions, which is then used to predict labels of the actual data samples. This method is widely used in practice when the null and alternative are only specified via simulators (as in many scientific experiments).
  We study goodness-of-fit, two-sample ($\mathsf{TS}$) and likelihood-free hypothesis testing ($\mathsf{LFHT}$), and show that $\mathsf{CAT}$ achieves (near-)minimax optimal sample complexity in both the dependence on the total-variation ($\mathsf{TV}$) separation $\epsilon$ and the probability of error $\delta$ in a variety of non-parametric settings, including discrete distributions, $d$-dimensional distributions with a smooth density, and the Gaussian sequence model. In particular, we close the high probability sample complexity of $\mathsf{LFHT}$ for each class. As another highlight, we recover the minimax optimal complexity of $\mathsf{TS}$ over discrete distributions, which was recently established by Diakonikolas et al. (2021). The corresponding $\mathsf{CAT}$ simply compares empirical frequencies in the first half of the data, and rejects the null when the classification accuracy on the second half is better than random.</description>

      <title>On the admissibility of Horvitz-Thompson estimator for estimating causal effects under network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Horvitz-Thompson (H-T) estimator is widely used for estimating network causal effects. We study its optimality properties by embedding it in the class of all linear estimators. We show that, under any form of interference, the H-T estimator is inadmissible with respect to mean squared error for designs that generate a random number of units for a given treatment-exposure combination, which includes completely randomized and Bernoulli designs. In contrast, the Hajek and Ratio estimators are admissible under such designs as long as their weights exceed one. We show that the H-T estimator becomes admissible under restricted randomization schemes that fix treatment-exposure counts.
  These findings motivate a new estimator, the conditional horvitz-Thompson (CHT) estimator, which uses propensity scores conditional on the realized number of units in each treatment-exposure combination. We prove that the CHT estimator is unbiased and admissible for network causal effects, for any design, within the class of linear estimators. Because computing conditional propensity scores can be challenging in practice, we develop three practical approximations: an MCMC approximation and two closed-form approximations based on the difference-in-means and Ratio estimators, the first one avoids computing any propensity scores. Numerical experiments on the Add Health network illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops some theory of the Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression. The theory developed for the correlated Dyson equation includes existence-uniqueness, spectral support bounds, and stability properties. This theory is new for constructing deterministic equivalents for pseudo-resolvents of a class of linearizations with correlated entries. In the application, this theory is used to give a deterministic equivalent of the test error in random features ridge regression, in a proportional scaling regime, wherein we have conditioned on both training and test datasets.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Assumption-free Tests for Algorithm Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithm evaluation and comparison are fundamental questions in machine learning and statistics -- how well does an algorithm perform at a given modeling task, and which algorithm performs best? Many methods have been developed to assess algorithm performance, often based around cross-validation type strategies, retraining the algorithm of interest on different subsets of the data and assessing its performance on the held-out data points. Despite the broad use of such procedures, the theoretical properties of these methods are not yet fully understood. In this work, we explore some fundamental limits for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. In particular, we make a distinction between two questions: how good is an algorithm A at the problem of learning from a training set of size n, versus, how good is a particular fitted model produced by running A on a particular training data set of size $n$? Our main results prove that, for any test that treats the algorithm A as a ``black box'' (i.e., we can only study the behavior of A empirically), there is a fundamental limit on our ability to carry out inference on the performance of A, unless the number of available data points $N$ is many times larger than the evaluation sample size $n$ of interest. On the other hand, evaluating the performance of a particular fitted model can be easy when evaluating an algorithm is hard. We also ask whether an assumption of algorithmic stability might be sufficient to circumvent this hardness result. Surprisingly, we find that the same hardness result still holds for the problem of evaluating the performance of A, aside from a high-stability regime where fitted models are essentially nonrandom. Finally, we also establish similar hardness results for the problem of comparing multiple algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reviving pseudo-inverses: Asymptotic properties of large dimensional Moore-Penrose and Ridge-type inverses with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive high-dimensional asymptotic properties of the Moore-Penrose inverse and, as a byproduct, of various ridge-type inverses of the sample covariance matrix. In particular, the analytical expressions of the asymptotic behavior of the weighted sample trace moments of generalized inverse matrices are deduced in terms of the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can be easily computed in practice. The existent results for pseudo-inverses are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings provide universal methodology for construction of fully data-driven improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, optimal portfolio weights and beyond. It is found that the Moore-Penrose inverse acts asymptotically as a certain regularizer of the true covariance matrix and it seems that its proper transformation (shrinkage) performs similarly to or even outperforms the existing benchmarks in many applications, while keeping the computational time as minimal as possible.</description>

      <title>Hybrid estimation for a mixed fractional Black-Scholes model with random effects from discrete time observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid estimation procedure to estimate global fixed parameters and subject-specific random effects in a mixed fractional Black-Scholes model based on discrete time observations. Specifically, we consider $N$ independent stochastic processes, each driven by a linear combination of standard Brownian motion and an independent fractional Brownian motion, and governed by a drift term that depends on an unobserved random effect with unknown distribution. Based on discrete-time statistics of process increments, we construct parametric estimators for the Brownian motion volatility, the scaling parameter for the fractional Brownian motion, and the Hurst parameter using a generalized method of moments. We establish strong consistency and joint asymptotic normality of these estimators. Then, from one trajectory, we consistently estimate the random effects, using a plug-in approach, and we study their asymptotic behavior under different asymptotic regimes as $N$ and $n$ grow. Finally, we construct a nonparametric estimator for the distribution function of these random effects using a Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev-Gauss nodes based method, and we analyze its asymptotic properties as both the number of subjects $N$ and the number of observations per-subject $n$ increase. A numerical simulation framework is also investigated to illustrate the theoretical results of the estimators behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multivariate Kendall-$\tau$ statistic, denoted by $K_n$, plays a significant role in robust statistical analysis. This paper establishes the limiting properties of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $K_n$. We demonstrate that the ESD of $\frac{1}{2}pK_n$ converges almost surely to the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur law with variance parameter $\frac{1}{2}$, analogous to the classical result for sample covariance matrices. Using Stieltjes transform techniques, we extend these results to the independent component model, deriving a fixed-point equation that characterizes the limiting spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{2}tr\Sigma K_n$. The theoretical findings are validated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

Abstract: What assumptions about the data-generating process are required to permit a causal interpretation of partial regression coefficients? To answer this question, this paper generalizes Pearl's single-door and back-door criteria and proposes a new criterion that enables the identification of total or partial causal effects. In addition, this paper elucidates the mechanism of post-treatment bias, showing that a repeated sequence of nodes can be a potential source of this bias. The results apply to linear data-generating processes represented by directed acyclic graphs with distribution-free error terms.</description>

      <title>When Does Bottom-up Beat Top-down in Hierarchical Community Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive (top-down) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative (bottom-up) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a linkage method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their applications in network analysis.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

Abstract: Structured data in the form of networks are increasingly common in a number of fields, including the social sciences, biology, physics, computer science, and many others. A key task in network analysis is community detection, which typically consists of dividing the nodes into groups such that nodes within a group are strongly connected, while connections between groups are relatively scarce. A generative model well suited for the formation of such communities is the assortative stochastic block model (SBM), which prescribes a higher probability of a connection between nodes belonging to the same block rather than to different blocks. A recent line of work has utilized Bayesian nonparametric methods to recover communities in the SBM by placing a prior distribution on the number of blocks and estimating block assignments via collapsed Gibbs samplers. However, efficiently incorporating the assortativity constraint through the prior remains an open problem. In this work, we address this gap by studying the effect of enforcing assortativity on Bayesian community detection and identifying the scenarios in which it pays dividends in comparison with standard SBM. We illustrate our findings through an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning on Hypergraphs</title>

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard baselines.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Regularization Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across diverse learning settings.</description>

      <title>Source-Optimal Training is Transfer-Suboptimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a fundamental misalignment in transfer learning: the source regularization that minimizes source risk almost never coincides with the regularization maximizing transfer benefit. Through sharp phase boundaries for L2-SP ridge regression, we characterize the transfer-optimal source penalty $\tau_0^*$ for a fixed task alignment. With sufficiently weak alignment, $\tau_0^*$ is always larger than the source optimal regularization, however with strong alignment $\tau_0^*$ diverges predictably from task-optimal values: requiring stronger regularization in high-SNR regimes and weaker regularization in low-SNR regimes. Additionally, in isotropic settings the decision to transfer is remarkably independent of target sample size and noise, depending only on task alignment and source characteristics. CIFAR-10 and MNIST experiments confirm this counterintuitive pattern persists in non-linear networks.</description>
