      <title>Updating DMD Operators for Changes in Domain Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and reliable surrogate models are critical for optimization, control and uncertainty analysis in geological carbon-storage projects, yet high-fidelity multiphase simulators remain too expensive. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) offers an attractive data-driven reduction framework, but its operators are trained for a single set of reservoir properties. When permeability or well location changes, conventional practice is to regenerate snapshots and retrain the surrogate, erasing most of the speed advantage. This work presents a lightweight alternative that updates an existing DMD or DMD-with-control model without incorporating new simulation data or retraining. Two complementary update strategies are introduced. For cases where permeability changes uniformly across the domain, the proposed updates adjust the models internal dynamics and control response to match the new flow timescale. When permeability varies in space, the approach modifies the spatial representation so that high-permeability zones are given greater influence on the models reduced basis. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed updates recover plume migration and pressure build-up within three percent of a freshly trained surrogate yet execute hundreds of times faster than full retraining. These methods therefore enable real-time optimization and rapid what-if studies while preserving the physical fidelity demanded by carbon-storage workflows.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Generators for Condensed Matter via Riemannian Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium distributions is fundamental to statistical mechanics. While flow matching has emerged as scalable state-of-the-art paradigm for generative modeling, its potential for equilibrium sampling in condensed-phase systems remains largely unexplored. We address this by incorporating the periodicity inherent to these systems into continuous normalizing flows using Riemannian flow matching. The high computational cost of exact density estimation intrinsic to continuous normalizing flows is mitigated by using Hutchinson's trace estimator, utilizing a crucial bias-correction step based on cumulant expansion to render the stochastic estimates suitable for rigorous thermodynamic reweighting. Our approach is validated on monatomic ice, demonstrating the ability to train on systems of unprecedented size and obtain highly accurate free energy estimates without the need for traditional multistage estimators.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modelling of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor using NekRS and the Fission Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has the particularity that the coolant is also the fuel, which tightens the coupling between neutronics and thermal hydraulics as the fuel circulates through the primary system. Therefore, developing computational models to analyze the MSFR requires a multiphysics approach. In this paper, we propose developing a neutronic thermal-hydraulic computational model of the MSFR that uses a reduced-order model to solve the neutronics equations. The principal computational tool chosen for this purpose is the high-fidelity code Cardinal, a wrapping within the MOOSE framework that integrates the Computational Fluid Dynamics code NekRS and the Monte Carlo particle transport code OpenMC. However, we use the Fission Matrix (FM) Method to solve the neutronics equations instead of OpenMC. The FM method can perform fast and still accurate neutronics simulations. It relies on precalculated databases obtained through a Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Extended scattering channels for random matrix simulations of polarized light transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the propagation of light through disordered media is central to understanding and controlling wave transport in diverse optical and mesoscopic applications. Here, we present a random matrix simulation framework for modeling the transport of polarized light through random media composed of arbitrary particulate scatterers. Our approach employs extended scattering channels applied to angular spectral decompositions of the underlying fields, enabling flexible representations of arbitrary illumination and detection profiles. In contrast to previous work, this framework provides a rigorous treatment of scattering matrix correlations and offers novel geometric insights into the optical memory effect. We provide a detailed exposition of the underlying theory and illustrate several key features through numerical simulations. Our work is supported by a free accompanying codebase.</description>

      <title>Trotter Error and Orbital Transformations in Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation with Trotter product formulae is straightforward and requires little overhead in terms of logical qubits. The choice of the orbital basis significantly affects circuit depth, with localised orbitals yielding lowest circuit depths. However, literature results point to large Trotter errors incurred by localised orbitals. Here, we therefore investigate the effect of orbital transformations on Trotter error. We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced). (iii) Application of propagators that change the computational basis between Trotter steps. Our numerical results show that reliably reducing Trotter error by orbital transformations is challenging. General recipes to produce low Trotter errors cannot be easily derived, despite analytical expressions which suggest ways to decrease Trotter error. Importantly, we found that localised orbital bases do not produce large Trotter errors in molecular calculations, which is an important result for efficient QPE set-ups.</description>

      <title>peapods: A Rust-Accelerated Monte Carlo Package for Ising Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present peapods (github.com/PeaBrane/peapods), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on arbitrary-dimensional hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen--Wang and Wolff cluster updates, and parallel tempering. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperature of the two-dimensional Ising model via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.</description>

      <title>Certified Uncertainty for Surrogate Models of Neutron Star Equations of State via Mondrian Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multitask surrogate for neutron-star equations of state (EoSs) that delivers \emph{distribution-free}, certified uncertainty via split conformal prediction (CP) and its Mondrian variant. The surrogate ingests a six-parameter piecewise-polytropic representation $(\log_{10}p_1,\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2,\Gamma_3,\rho_1,\rho_2)$ -- with fixed transition densities $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ -- and jointly performs (i) validity classification under physical/observational constraints and (ii) regression of $M_{\max}$, $R(M_{\max})$, $R_{1.4}$, and $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Trained on a balanced set of $40{,}000$ EoSs, the model attains near-perfect discrimination (AUC $\approx 0.997$) and sub-percent relative errors for masses and radii, with few-percent error for tidal deformability. Across $\alpha\in[0.05,0.25]$, empirical coverages closely track $1-\alpha$ for both Standard and Mondrian CP; in conservative regimes, Mondrian yields narrower average physical widths at comparable coverage. To our knowledge, this is the first application of class-conditioned (Mondrian) conformal calibration to neutron-star EoS surrogates, enabling efficient, reproducible, and uncertainty-aware inference; the framework is readily extensible to functional targets (e.g., full $R(M)$ curves).</description>

      <title>Scale-PINN: Learning Efficient Physics-Informed Neural Networks Through Sequential Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations, yet adoption in science and engineering is limited by slow training and modest accuracy relative to modern numerical solvers. We introduce the Sequential Correction Algorithm for Learning Efficient PINN (Scale-PINN), a learning strategy that bridges modern physics-informed learning with numerical algorithms. Scale-PINN incorporates the iterative residual-correction principle, a cornerstone of numerical solvers, directly into the loss formulation, marking a paradigm shift in how PINN losses can be conceived and constructed. This integration enables Scale-PINN to achieve unprecedented convergence speed across PDE problems from different physics domain, including reducing training time on a challenging fluid-dynamics problem for state-of-the-art PINN from hours to sub-2 minutes while maintaining superior accuracy, and enabling application to representative problems in aerodynamics and urban science. By uniting the rigor of numerical methods with the flexibility of deep learning, Scale-PINN marks a significant leap toward the practical adoption of PINNs in science and engineering through scalable, physics-informed learning. Codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/SCALE-PINN.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bath Fitting for Hamiltonian-Diagonalization Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based initialization method to overcome the nonlinear bath-fitting bottleneck in Hamiltonian-diagonalization-based dynamical mean-field theory (HD-DMFT). In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution.</description>

      <title>Exact Discrete Stochastic Simulation with Deep-Learning-Scale Gradient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is essential when discreteness and noise drive system behavior, but the hard categorical event selection in Gillespie-type algorithms blocks gradient-based learning. We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains.</description>

      <title>On the importance of stochasticity in closures of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic closures for coarse-grained turbulence models help reproduce mean statistics, but often fail to capture the finite-time growth of uncertainty. Using the framework of shell models as a quantitative multi-scale testbed, we compare fully resolved simulations with large-eddy simulations using either stochastic or deterministic subgrid closures. While in the fully resolved system a single microscopic perturbation is rapidly amplified by strongly chaotic dynamics, truncation produces a strong delay and suppression of variance growth when uncertainty is introduced through initial condition perturbations only. We show that a data-driven Langevin-type stochastic closure restores the correct timing and magnitude of variance growth across scales, demonstrating that sustained stochasticity is essential for predictability in reduced turbulent dynamics.</description>

      <title>The effect of the A-site cation on the phase transition temperature of metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for the practical application of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the instability of the desired perovskite phase relative to the optically non-active $\delta$ phase. To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites.</description>

      <title>Energy gap of quantum spin glasses: a projection quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $\Delta$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $\Delta$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $\Delta$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $\Delta \propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.</description>

Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream physics hybrid networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely ''Kovasznay flow'' problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our recent work [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, 044602 (2025)], where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions between resolved and unresolved variables, as well as the scale invariance of multipliers (ratios between adjacent shells) within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order statistical moments, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dopants can tune the performance of MoS2 in various applications, but use of molecular dynamics simulations for doped MoS2 materials discovery is limited by the lack of multi-dopant interatomic potentials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) could be a solution, but the accuracy of these potentials must first be evaluated. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed MLIP, META's Universal Model for Atoms (UMA), for 25 different MoS2 dopants spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals in Mo substitution, S substitution, and intercalated positions by benchmarking the MLIP-predicted formation energy and the dopant-induced structural change against density functional theory calculations. The computational framework for MLIP validation and simulations are described in detail and the source code is made open source. The MLIP is then demonstrated by performing heating-cooling simulations of MoS2 supercells with all 25 dopants. These simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides a computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance.</description>

      <title>HPC-Driven Modeling with ML-Based Surrogates for Magnon-Photon Dynamics in Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating hybrid magnonic quantum systems remains a challenge due to the large disparity between the timescales of the two systems. We present a massively parallel GPU-based simulation framework that enables fully coupled, large-scale modeling of on-chip magnon-photon circuits. Our approach resolves the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic and electromagnetic fields with high spatiotemporal fidelity. To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>
