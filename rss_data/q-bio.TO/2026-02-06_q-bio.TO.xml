      <title>Load Transfer along Continuous Collagen Fibers Reduces the Importance of Wall Thickness Variations</title>

Abstract: The mechanical response of biological soft tissues is influenced by wall heterogeneity, including spatial variations in wall thickness. Traditional models for homogeneous soft tissues under uniaxial loading predict higher stretch and stress in thinner regions. In fact, large gradients in stretch and stress are predicted to be induced by spatial variations in wall thickness. In prior studies, the role of collagen fibers in regions of thickness transition has been largely neglected or only considered in terms of their effect on anisotropy. Here, we explore the role of collagen fibers as primary load-bearing components across regions of varying wall thickness, using a three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model incorporating explicit collagen fiber architecture and a gradual thickness gradient. We examined two distinct collagen fiber configurations across the thickness transition: one featuring abrupt fiber termination and another with fiber continuity. Finite element analysis (FEA) under uniaxial tension revealed that load transfer by continuous fibers across the specimen markedly reduced the importance of the change in wall thickness, with stretch differentials dropping from ~20% (fiber-termination network) to 0.68% (continuous fibers) and stress differentials dropping from ~65% (fiber-termination network) to 2.3% (continuous fibers). Fiber tortuosity delayed the point at which mechanical response was governed by fiber structure. These findings demonstrate the critical role of fiber continuity in reducing stretch and stress gradients across regions of varying wall thickness and clarify the importance of accurately representing fiber architecture when modeling soft tissues with heterogeneous wall thickness.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some - but not all - elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>
