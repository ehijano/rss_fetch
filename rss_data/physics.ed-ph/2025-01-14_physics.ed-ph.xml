      <title>Astronomy and Society: The Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public appeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a large number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to the field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to attract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM fields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse. In this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and communication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for development, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.
  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an analysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for institutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific area. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection should take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the various stakeholders involved.</description>

      <title>Inference precision about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer informations and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compile expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translate plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The precision of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the precision discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum properties with informationally redundant external representations: An eye-tracking study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research indicates that the use of multiple external representations MERs has the potential to support learning, especially in complex scientific areas, such as quantum physics. In particular, the provision of informationally redundant external representations can have advantageous effects on learning outcomes. This is of special relevance for quantum education, where various external representations are available and their effective use is recognised as crucial to student learning. However, research on the effects of informationally redundant external representations in quantum learning is limited. The present study aims to contribute to the development of effective learning materials by investigating the effects of learning with informationally redundant external representations on students' learning of quantum physics. Using a between-subjects design, 113 students were randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions. The control group learnt with a traditional multimedia learning unit on the behaviour of a single photon in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The three intervention groups received redundant essential information in the Dirac formalism, the Bloch sphere, or both. The use of eye tracking enabled insight into the learning process depending on the external representations provided. While the results indicate no effect of the study condition on learning outcomes (content knowledge and cognitive load), the analysis of visual behaviour reveals decreased learning efficiency with the addition of the Bloch sphere to the multimedia learning unit. The results are discussed based on current insight in learning with MERs. The study emphasises the need for careful instructional design to balance the associated cognitive load when learning with informationally redundant external representations.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Variables: A Physics Classroom Activity on Correlation and Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classroom activity for high school physics students is presented to explore the distinction between correlation and causation. Using data linking ice cream sales to drowning deaths, presented within a fictional news article, students analyze the relationship, create plots, and identify temperature as the hidden variable explaining the correlation. The activity fosters critical thinking by engaging students in scientific reasoning, illustrating how data representation influences conclusions, and supporting the development of scientific literacy and data interpretation skills.</description>
