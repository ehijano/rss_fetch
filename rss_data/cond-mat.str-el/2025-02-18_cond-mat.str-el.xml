      <title>Ultrafast Charge Separation on the Nanoscale Induced by a Uniform Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When illuminated by white light, atoms, molecules, and materials absorb only certain characteristic energy contributions based on their absorption properties. Here, we show that this effect can be translated from energy to space: a spatially uniform laser pulse can create strongly localized carrier excitations, including excitons, and spatial charge separation on the sub-nanometer scale within a few femtoseconds, opening new avenues for nanoelectronics and bringing petahertz switching within reach. Using nonequilibrium Green functions simulations we demonstrate this effect by exciting targeted areas of small graphene nanoribbon heterostructures by careful choice of the laser energy and polarization.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in the electronic, magnetic and thermal behavior near the Invar compositions of Fe-Ni alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$~($x$ = 0.32, 0.36, 0.40, 0.50) alloys have been investigated using synchrotron based x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique with x-rays of wavelength 0.63658 \AA\ down to 50 K temperature, magnetic measurement using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer and high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with monochromatic AlK$_\alpha$ radiation. The XRD studies suggest a single phase with fcc structure for $x$ = 0.36, 0.40, and 0.50 ~alloys and a mixed phase for $x$ = 0.32 alloy containing both bcc and fcc structures. The lattice parameter of the alloys exhibits a linear dependence on temperature giving rise to a temperature independent coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The lowest CTE is observed for $x$ = 0.36 Invar alloy as expected while $x$ = 0.50 alloy exhibits the highest CTE among the alloys studied. The CTE of the fcc component of mixed phase alloy is close to that of Invar alloy. The temperature dependence of magnetization of the alloys down to 2 K reveals an overall antiferromagnetic interactions within the ferromagnetic phase causing the magnetization decreasing with cooling. The field cooled and zero field cooled data show larger differences for the Invar compositions; this is also manifested in the magnetic hysteresis data at 2 K and 300 K.</description>

      <title>Circular Dichroism in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering: Probing Altermagnetic Domains in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism provides a means to identify ferromagnetic, chiral, and altermagnetic orders via their time-reversal-symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking. However, differentiating magnetic domains related by crystallographic symmetries remains a technical challenge. Here we reveal a circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra from the altermagnetic MnTe. The azimuthal dependence of the RIXS-CD intensity of the magnon excitations indicates a dominant occupation of a single altermagnetic domain. The RIXS-CD in our scattering geometry is ascribed to the mirror-symmetry breaking associated with the $\mathcal{T}$-broken altermagnetic order. Our results establish RIXS-CD as a domain-sensitive probe of elementary excitations in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Itinerant topological magnons and spin excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides: Mapping electron topology to spin counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Point-group symmetry enriched topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classification of two-dimensional (2D) topological orders enriched by point-group symmetries, by generalizing the folding appraoch which was previously developed for mirror-symmetry-enriched topological orders. We fold the 2D plane hosting the topological order into the foundamental domain of the group group, which is a sector with an angle $2\pi/n$ for the cyclic point group $C_n$ and a sector with an angle $\pi/n$ for the dihedral point group $D_{2n}$, and the point-group symmetries becomes onsite unitary symmetries on the sector. The enrichment of the point-group symmetries is then fully encoded at the boundary of the sector and the apex of the section, which forms a junction between the two boundaries. The mirror-symmetry enrichment encoded on the boundaries is analyzed by the classification theory of symmetric gapped boundaries, and the point-group-symmetry enrichment encoded on the junction is analyzed by a framework for classifying symmetric gapped junctions between boundaries which we develop in this work. We show that at the junction, there are two potential obstructions, which we refer to as an $H^1$ obstruction and an $H^2$ obstruction, respectively. When the obstruction vanishes, the junction, and therefore the point-group-symmetry-enriched topological orders, are classified by an $H^0$ cohomology class and an $H^1$ cohomology class, which can be understood as an additional Abelian anyon and a symmetry charge attached to the rotation center, respectively. These results are consistent with the classification of onsite-symmetry-enriched topological orders, where the $H^1$ and $H^2$ obstructions and the junction corresponds to the $H^3$ and $H^4$ obstructions for onsite symmetries, respectively.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced liquid-solid phase coexistence in 2D electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent imaging experiments show a surprisingly robust regime of liquid-solid phase coexistence in a 2D electron system near the quantum melting/freezing transition, with the two phases mixed in mesoscopic domains. Strikingly, the experiments find no noticeable difference in electron density between the liquid and solid domains, which is at odds with both microemulsion scenarios and scenarios in which phase coexistence is driven by fluctuations of a long-ranged disorder potential. Here, we show that such phase coexistence without density difference can be induced by random fluctuations of a short-ranged disorder potential. We further show that disorder tends to stabilize the Wigner Crystal phase to higher densities, which is also consistent with the experiments.</description>

      <title>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>

      <title>Valency, charge-transfer, and orbital-dependent correlation in bilayer nickelates Nd3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the bulk electronic structure of Nd3Ni2O7 using Ni 2p core-level hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy combined with density functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal a large deviation of the Ni 3d occupation from the formal Ni2.5+ valency, highlighting the importance of the charge-transfer from oxygen ligands. We find that the dominant d8 configuration is accompanied by nearly equal contributions from d7 and d9 states, exhibiting an unusual valence state among Ni-based oxides. Finally, we discuss the Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbital-dependent hybridization, correlation and local spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the charge-density-wave superlattice of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of intriguing phenomena, including exciton condensation, orbital ordering, and emergence of chirality, have been proposed to accompany charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$. Explaining these effects relies on knowledge of the atomic displacement pattern underlying the CDW, yet structural proposals based on spatially-averaging bulk crystal diffraction and surface-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy have remained inconsistent. Here, we revisit the CDW superlattice structure with selected-area electron diffraction, a bulk-sensitive probe capable of capturing sub-micrometer spatial variations while maintaining high momentum resolution. We resolved two distinct, spatially separated CDW phases characterized by different interlayer ordering. In both phases, previously reported atomic displacement patterns fail to account for the observed extinction rules. Instead, our analysis reveals a new superlattice structure, which features a large number of nearly degenerate CDW domains. These findings not only provide a new basis for understanding the gyrotropic electronic order and metastability in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, they also underscore the importance of bulk-sensitive mesoscopic techniques in investigating materials that host unconventional superlattices.</description>

      <title>High Quality Single Crystal of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Material RuBr3 Synthesized under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev quantum spin liquids have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics over the past decade. To understand their emergent quantum phenomena, high-quality single crystals of substantial size are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate RuBr3, achieving millimeter-sized crystals through a self-flux method under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The crystals exhibit well-defined cleavage planes with a lustrous appearance. Transport characterizations exhibit a narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior with 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV band-gap in ab plane and along c axis, respectively. Magnetic measurement shows a transition to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at approximately 29 K both in ab plane and along c axis. Notably, the N\'eel temperature increases to 34 K with an applied magnetic field of up to 7 T in the ab plane, but without any change along c axis. The large size and high quality of RuBr3 single crystals provide a valuable platform for investigating various interactions, particularly the Kitaev interaction, and for elucidating the intrinsic physical properties of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Application of Many-body Non-perturbative Theories to the Three-Dimensional Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive Fermi-Hubbard model stands out as a simple model for studying the pairing and superconductivity of fermions on a lattice. In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green's functions and density of states. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the temperature at which the pseudogap appears.</description>

      <title>Competition Between Multiferroic and Magnetic Soliton Lattice States in DyFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous breaking of time reversal and inversion symmetries in multiferroics couples ferroelectricity to magnetism and is a source of unusual physical phenomena that can be used in next-generation electronic devices. A notable example is DyFeO$_3$, which under applied magnetic fields exhibits a giant linear magnetoelectric response and a large spontaneous electric polarization induced by coexisting orders of Fe and Dy spins. Here, we use high-resolution neutron diffraction to show that at zero field DyFeO$_3$ hosts an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice formed by spatially ordered Dy domain walls with an average domain size of 231(8) \AA. The long-ranged interaction between the domain walls is mediated by magnons propagating through the Fe subsystem and is analogous to the Yukawa force in particle physics. An applied magnetic field destroys the long-ranged incommensurate order, unlocks the linear magnetoelectric response and stabilizes the ferroelectric state. The magnetic domain walls are electrically charged and the soliton array dimerizes when both electric and magnetic fields are applied. Numerical simulations with experimental parameters suggest, that the generic competition between the ferroelectric and incommensurate states can be effectively controlled by an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Superconductivity from Finite-Range Attractive Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of anomalous Hall effect due to magnetic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall {\color{black} e}ffect (AHE) has emerged as a key indicator of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and topological features in electronic band structures. Absent of a magnetic field, the AHE requires spontaneous TRSB but has proven hard to probe due to averaging over domains. The anomalous component of the Hall effect is thus frequently derived from extrapolating the magnetic field dependence of the Hall response. We show that discerning whether the AHE is an intrinsic property of the field free system becomes intricate in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations. {\color{black}As a study case,} we use the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe, where TRSB can be toggled via a ferromagnetic transition, providing a transparent view of the AHE's topological origin. Through a combination of thermodynamic, transport and muon spin relaxation measurements, we contrast the behaviour below the ferromagnetic transition temperature to that of strong magnetic fluctuations above. Our results {\color{black}on PrAlGe provide general insights into the} interpretation of anomalous Hall signals in systems where TRSB is debated, such as families of Kagome metals or certain transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>A square skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Exerting chemical pressure on the kagome lattice as frustration control in the kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$ forms a series of compounds, wherein the chemical pressure realized by the $A-$site cation tunes the spin exchange in the frustrated distorted kagome lattice. Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for $A=$ rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by $A$~=~Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu$^{2+}$ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Diffusive spin transport of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain in the Ising regime at zero magnetic field and finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of this paper on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at finite temperatures T&gt;0 have two complementary goals. The first is to identify the spin carriers of all its Sq&gt;0 energy eigenstates and to show that their spin elementary currents fully control the spin-transport quantities. Here Sq is the q-spin of the continuous SUq(2) symmetry of the model for anisotropy &gt;1. To achieve this goal, our studies rely on a suitable exact physical-spin representation.Both the spin stiffness and the zero-field spin-diffusion constant are expressed in terms of thermal expectation values of the square of the elementary currents carried by the spin carriers. Our second goal is to confirm that the zero-field and finite-temperature spin transport is normal diffusive for anisotropy &gt;1. We use two complementary methods that rely on an inequality for the T&gt;0 spin stiffness and the above thermal expectation values, respectively, to show that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish. Complementarily, for T&gt;0 and anisotropy &gt;1, the spin-diffusion constant is found to be finite and enhanced upon lowering T, reaching its largest yet finite values at low temperatures. Evidence suggests that it diverges in the anisotropy limit to 1 for T&gt;0, consistent with T&gt;0 anomalous superdiffusive spin transport at anisotropy 1 and zero field.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory and thermal Hall effect of magnons in square-lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a powerful probe of neutral quasiparticles and associated gauge fields in insulating materials. Although the emergence of a thermal Hall effect is known to be sensitive to lattice geometry and gauge structures, an intuitive understanding of the conditions for its emergence remains limited, especially for edge-shared lattice geometries such as square and triangular lattices. Here, we develop an effective field theory of magnons in square-lattice antiferromagnets to establish the intuitive picture that elucidates the conditions for a finite thermal Hall response. By constructing an effective field theory from a spin model on the square lattice, we show that its low-energy excitations can be described by magnons with an effective SU(2) gauge field and Zeeman field that couple to magnon's pseudospins, which reflect the two-sublattice degrees of freedom in the antiferromagnets. The field strength associated with the SU(2) gauge field acts as a pseudospin-dependent magnetic field, bending the magnon's trajectories in opposite directions depending on their pseudospin. In addition, the effective Zeeman field induces an imbalance between pseudospin up and down magnons, and the combination of these two fields gives rise to the thermal Hall effect of magnons. This intuitive picture provides a systematic classification of magnetic orders in square-lattice antiferromagnets based on the presence or absence of the thermal Hall effect. We expect that our framework can be extended to various other spin models.</description>

      <title>Floquet topological state induced by light-driven band inversion in SnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High intensity coherent light can dress matter, realizing new hybrid phases that are not accessible in equilibrium. This effect results from the coherent interaction between Bloch states inside the solid and the periodic field of impinging photons which produces hybrid light-matter states called Floquet-Bloch states that can alter properties of the solid. Optically inducing a topological state in a semiconductor using so-called Floquet engineering is an exciting prospect. However, it has not been realized, despite its theoretical prediction more than 10 years ago. Here we show that an ultrashort-lived topological state that is absent at equilibrium in the ground state of SnTe can be created with femtosecond light pulses. This occurs when the photoexcitation is similar in energy with the band gap of this polar semiconductor. We observe a concomitant renormalization of the band dispersions that reveals the generation of Floquet states connecting to the topological state. We therefore provide the first direct experimental observation of a Floquet topological state and propose that it is driven by a light-induced band inversion in SnTe. Our discovery opens the way for controlling optically on-demand the topological properties of semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent approach to the X-ray photoemission problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray photoemission from simple metals has been thoroughly studied, experimentally, and theoretically, in the frequency domain. Here we investigate the same problem in the time domain, with the ultimate purpose of improving the numerical renormalization-group method. We focus our study on the time dependence of the photoemission current $\mathcal{F}(t)$, a fidelity, in the terminology of quantum information. To establish benchmarks, we first calculate $\mathcal{F}(t)$ analytically and numerically for a tight-binding model. Analytically, we derive an approximate expression that becomes very precise at large times. Numerically, we diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian and compute $\mathcal{F}(t)$ from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a straightforward procedure that covers the segment of the $t$ axis in which the analytical expression is less accurate. The time dependence shows features of physical interest that have received little attention because they are inconspicuous in the frequency domain; the analytical expression provides a simple interpretation and traces them to an unusual form of interference. We then turn to eNRG, a recently proposed real-space variant that is more flexible than Wilson's NRG method, and present two complementary time-dependent algorithms. Comparison with the benchmarks shows that one of the eNRG algorithms yields virtually exact photocurrents with a small fraction of the computational effort to diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian. The second algorithm is computationally less demanding and produces precise results at long times. In contemplation of extensions to correlated-impurity models, we identify sources of deviation and discuss the virtues and drawbacks of the two procedures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gilbert Damping via Cubic Spin-Orbit Coupling at 2DHG/Ferromagnetic Insulator Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of Gilbert damping at 2DHG/ferromagnetic insulator (FI) interfaces, where spin pumping from the FI layer injects spins into the 2DHG, and cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) significantly boosts spin relaxation and spin-pumping efficiency compared to 2DEG systems. The dominant contribution to spin damping arises from interband transitions which does exhibits conductivity-like behavior as the temperature, \( T \to 0 \). Our results reveal that damping remains stronger than in 2DEG due to the persistent influence of cubic RSOC. The interplay between RSOC and magnon absorption broadens the spectral response, with the damping peak shifting more notably at higher temperatures. Stronger RSOC expands the magnon interaction phase space, thus widening the damping spectrum. A key observation emerges with the Fermi level (\(E_f\)): a finite \(E_f\) sustains spin imbalance and enhances damping, whereas \(E_f = 0\) suppresses it, unlike in 2DEG. The electric field tunability of RSOC enables real-time control over spin relaxation and angular momentum transfer, offering a pathway toward voltage-controlled spintronic devices. These findings highlight the superior potential of 2DHG for tailoring spin dynamics via electric and thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</description>

Abstract: A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin $\frac{1}{2}$ chain can be constructed {\it via} projectors of various ranks \'{a} la Bravyi-Gosset. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non-invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality.</description>

Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</description>

Abstract: By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Insulating and metallic phases in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Insights from a backflow-inspired variational wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang formalism for phase transitions of interacting fermions using tensor networks</title>

Abstract: Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Strong interactions and correlation effects may lead to exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids and unconventional superconductors, that often compete with other symmetry broken states including ordered magnets and charge density waves. Here, we put forward a formalism for determining the phase diagram of fermionic systems that combines recent progress in the field of Lee-Yang theory of phase transitions with many-body tensor-network methods. Using this strategy, we map out the phase diagram of a fermionic chain, where charge density waves form owing to strong repulsion. Specifically, from the high cumulants of the order parameter, we extract the dominant zeros of the moment-generating function in chains of finite size. By extrapolating their positions to the thermodynamic limit, we determine the boundaries between competing phases. Our formalism provides a strategy for determining critical points in fermionic systems, and it is based on fluctuations of the order parameter, which are measurable quantities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{102}$, 195122 (2020)]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, where we found encouraging results from weak to intermediate couplings.</description>

Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that often arise from a complex interplay between microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanisms and guided us in manipulating the dynamical properties of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanisms between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to discoveries of the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

Abstract: Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>The Saga of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams</title>

Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Abstract: Topological quantum error correction based on the manipulation of the anyonic defects constitutes one of the most promising frameworks towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum devices. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these defects interact with external defects such as boundaries or domain walls. Motivated by this line of thought, in this work, we study the fusion events between anyons in the bulk and at the boundary in fixed-point models of 2+1-dimensional non-chiral topological order defined by arbitrary fusion categories. Our construction uses generalized tube algebra techniques to construct a bi-representation of bulk and boundary defects. We explicitly derive a formula to calculate the fusion multiplicities of a bulk-to-boundary fusion event for twisted quantum double models and calculate some exemplary fusion events for Abelian models and the (twisted) quantum double model of S3, the simplest non-Abelian group-theoretical model. Moreover, we use the folding trick to study the anyonic behavior at non-trivial domain walls between twisted S3 and twisted Z2 as well as Z3 models. A recurring theme in our construction is an isomorphism relating twisted cohomology groups to untwisted ones. The results of this work can directly be applied to study logical operators in two-dimensional topological error correcting codes with boundaries described by a twisted gauge theory of a finite group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional hard-core loop-gas model as a way to regularize the asymptotically free massive continuum quantum field theory that emerges at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop-gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Site-selective polar compensation of Mott electrons in a double perovskite heterointerface</title>

Abstract: Double perovskite oxides (DPOs) with two transition metal ions ($A_2$$BB^\prime$O$_6$) offer a fascinating platform for exploring exotic physics and practical applications. Studying these DPOs as ultrathin epitaxial thin films on single crystalline substrates can add another dimension to engineering electronic, magnetic, and topological phenomena. Understanding the consequence of polarity mismatch between the substrate and the DPO would be the first step towards this broad goal. We investigate this by studying the interface between a prototypical insulating DPO Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and a wide-band gap insulator SrTiO$_3$. The interface is found to be insulating in nature. By combining several experimental techniques and density functional theory, we establish a site-selective charge compensation process that occurs explicitly at the Mn site of the film, leaving the Ni sites inert. We further demonstrate that such surprising selectivity, which cannot be explained by existing mechanisms of polarity compensation, is directly associated with their electronic correlation energy scales. This study establishes the crucial role of Mott physics in polar compensation process and paves the way for designer doping strategies in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the critical temperature and disorder in holographic superconductors on superfluid density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For instance, it is known that the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature becomes linear in underdoped materials. In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Higher Representations and Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space -- namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass -- the confined and adjoint Higgs phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the Higgs phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and center vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>
