      <title>Reply to the comments of McMullen et al. (arXiv:2510.04828)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McMullen et al. [1] comment that the numerical simulations that explicitly include random velocity fluctuations ``should exhibit a thermal-fluctuation-dominated range'' consistent with the literature, so that our results (J. Fluid Mech. 1008, R2, 2025) [2] ``contradict other results in the literature''. First of all, we would give an opposite example against this viewpoint: DNS results (that are badly polluted by numerical noises quickly, as mention in Section 2) implicitly include random numerical noises, but they also DO NOT exhibit a thermal-fluctuation-dominated range. In other words, DNS results in the literature qualitatively agree with ours at this point. In addition, we highly suggest that influences of numerical noises on statistics of turbulent flows given by ALL numerical approaches should be carefully checked, since numerical noises might have huge influences on statistics of chaotic systems (including turbulence), as pointed by Lorenz [3] in 2006. Detailed replies are given below.</description>

      <title>Computational study of vertical-axis MHK turbines using a coupled flow-sediment-turbine modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and bed morphodynamics study to investigate the influence of sediment dynamics on the performance of a utility-scale marine hydrokinetic vertical-axis turbine (VAT) parametrized by an actuator surface model. By resolving the two-way interactions between turbine-induced flow structures and bed evolution, the study offers insights into the environmental implications of VAT deployment in riverine and marine settings. A range of tip speed ratios is examined to evaluate wake recovery, power production, and bed response. The actuator surface method (ASM) is implemented to capture the effects of rotating vertical blades on the flow, while the immersed boundary method accounts for fluid interactions with the channel walls and sediment layer. The results show that higher TSRs intensify turbulence, accelerate wake recovery over rigid beds, and enhance erosion and deposition patterns beneath and downstream of the turbine under live-bed conditions. Bed deformation under live-bed conditions induces asymmetrical wake structures through jet flows, further accelerating wake recovery and decreasing turbine performance by about 2%, compared to rigid-bed conditions. Considering the computational cost of the ASM framework, which is nearly $4\%$ of the turbine-resolving approach, it provides an efficient yet robust tool for assessing flow-sediment-turbine interactions.</description>

      <title>On Turbulent Behavior of the Generalized Surface Quasigeostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent behavior of the two-parameter family of generalized surface quasigeostrophic equations is examined both rigorously and numerically. We adapt a cascade mechanism argument to derive an energy spectrum that scales as $\kappa^{2\beta/3-3}$ where $\beta$ controls the regularity of the velocity ($\beta=1$ in the special case of the SQG). Direct numerical simulations indicate that this fits better than $\kappa^{\beta/3-3}$ which was derived in earlier work. Guided by earlier work on the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, we prove a certain condition implies a direct cascade of enstrophy, as well as an upper bound on the enstrophy dissipation rate, and sharp bounds on a dissipation wavenumber. The dependence of these rigorous results on the two parameters is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <title>On the effect of airfoil geometry on extreme vortex-gust encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, investigations on gust encounters have been limited to thin airfoils. In this work, we examine vortex-gust encounters by a family of airfoils at a chord-based Reynolds number Re_c=100, which includes variations in the gust ratio, initial gust position, gust radius, angle of attack, airfoil thickness, and airfoil camber. We examine differences in the flow fields, lift-element distributions, and aerodynamic responses across several airfoil-gust interactions. We observe a large deviation of the flow fields and aerodynamic responses with respect to the baseline flows for increasing gust ratios and gust sizes. The initial position of the vortex gust influences the magnitude of the velocity gradients observed near the leading edge, effectively heightening or mitigating the amplitude of the lift response. Moreover, the lift fluctuation increases with the angle of attack until it flattens around $10^\circ$, reminiscent of an unsteady stall-like regime. Furthermore, we report a decrease in the amplitude of the gust-induced lift fluctuations for thicker airfoils, which we attribute to a decrease in the vorticity production levels from the leading edge. The exploration of a sensitive subset of the parameter space uncovers relevant trends, shedding light on regions that have received limited attention in past studies, with special focus on the influence of airfoil geometry.</description>

      <title>A HHO formulation for variable density incompressible flows where the density is purely advected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with variable density that provides exact conservation of volume and, accordingly, pure advection of the density variable. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity-density-pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited for the simulation of mixtures of immiscible incompressible fluids, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of volume enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the convection dominated regime thanks to upwind stabilizations, weak imposition of boundary conditions, implicit high-order accurate time stepping encompassing unsteady boundary conditions, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. Numerical validation is performed showcasing convergence rates, pressure-robustness and pure advection of the density, thus we tackle the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at Reynolds $1~000$ and $5~000$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Incorporation of the Langmuir Adsorption Model into Compressible Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a gas-solid interfacial system where chemical species undergo reversible adsorption, we develop a mesoscopic stochastic modeling method that simulates both gas-phase hydrodynamics and surface coverage dynamics by coupling the Langmuir adsorption model with compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics. To this end, we derive a thermodynamically consistent mass-energy update scheme that accounts for how the mass and energy variables in the gas and surface subsystems should be updated according to the changes in the number of molecules of each species in each subsystem due to adsorption and desorption events. By performing a stochastic analysis for the ideal Langmuir model and the full hydrodynamic system, we analytically confirm that our mass-energy update scheme captures thermodynamic equilibrium predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics. We find that an internal energy correction term is needed, which is attributed to the difference in the mean kinetic energy of gas molecules colliding with the surface from that computed from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. By performing an equilibrium simulation study for an ideal gas mixture of CO and Ar with CO undergoing reversible adsorption, we validate our overall simulation method and implementation.</description>

      <title>Longer time accuracy for the Ladyzhenskya model with the EMAC formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate the EMAC formulation into the Ladyzhenskaya model (LM), a large eddy simulation (LES) of incompressible flows. The EMAC formulation, which conserves energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum even with weak enforcement of incompressibility, has been shown to provide tangible benefits over the popular skew-symmetric for direct numerical simulation and regularized models of the Navier Stokes equations (NSE). The combination of EMAC with the LM addresses the known over-dissipation issues associated with the classical Smagorinsky model (SM). We develop a finite element discretization for the EMAC-LM system and analyze its stability and derive numerical error estimates, showing improved long-time behavior compared to the standard LM approach, particularly due to EMAC's favorable Gronwall constant independent of the Reynolds number. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that the EMAC-LM model yields more accurate flow structures, especially at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of inner and outer motions in near-wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the causality of near-wall inner and outer turbulent motions. The inner motions are defined as the self-sustained near-wall cycle, and the outer motions as those living in the logarithmic layer exhibiting footprints on the near-wall region. Causal inference with three typical methods is performed, i.e. transfer entropy, information flow, and SURD (synergistic--unique--redundant decomposition of causality). The causal inference methods are first applied to several canonical problems to illustrate their abilities and differences, including a linear problem, a non-linear problem, and a low-dimensional model of near-wall turbulence. It is demonstrated that all three methods can produce consistent causal findings. Furthermore, we study the causalities between the inner and outer turbulent motions in a channel flow using the three methods with an improved inner-outer decomposition method. It is revealed that both the inner and outer motions are self-sustained and independent of each other, supporting the self-sustaining mechanism of turbulent motions at all scales. We also find that there are top-down and bottom-up influences in the outer motions and their near-wall footprints, challenging the traditional sole top-down view. More interestingly, pressure is identified to play an active role in the inner-outer causalities and may act as a bridge in linking the inner and outer turbulent motions.</description>

      <title>Classically studied coherent structures only paint a partial picture of wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the last 140 years, the mechanisms of transport and dissipation of energy in a turbulent flow have not been completely understood. Previous research has focused on analyzing the so-called coherent structures, organized flow patterns characterized by their spatial coherence, lifespan and significant contribution to momentum and energy transfer. However, the connection between these structures and the flow development is still uncertain. Here, we show a data-driven methodology for objectively identifying high-importance regions. A deep-learning model is trained to predict a future state of the flow and the gradient-SHAP explainability algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each grid point. Finally, high-importance regions are computed using the SHAP data and are compared to the other coherent structures. The SHAP analysis provides an objective way to identify the regions of higher importance, which exhibit different levels of agreement with the classical structures without being completely related to any particular one.</description>

      <title>Critical bubble bursting in real water. Effect of surface-active contaminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bursting of a bubble on a liquid free surface under critical conditions, i.e., those leading to the minimum (maximum) size (velocity) of the first-emitted jet droplet. Our experiments show that a tiny amount of surfactant considerably increases (decreases) the droplet radius (velocity). The volume of the first-emitted droplet increases by a factor of 20 for a concentration that produces an insignificant reduction in the bubble surface tension. The total liquid volume ejected by the bubble increases with the surfactant concentration. Surfactant accumulates at the bubble base due to cavity bottom shrinkage and surfactant convection. The resulting reduction in surface tension narrows the region of free surface reversal. Despite this effect, the size of the emitted droplet increases due to the Marangoni stress acting on the jet surface. Marangoni stress slows down the interface of the liquid jet, delaying the detachment of the droplet. More liquid flows into the droplet, increasing the mass and energy transfer to the resulting spray. A significant increase in the droplet size is also observed with a weak surfactant. This indicates that natural water contamination can substantially alter the bursting of bubbles under critical conditions. Our results may explain the size of the particles emitted by bubble bursting in seawater.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</description>
