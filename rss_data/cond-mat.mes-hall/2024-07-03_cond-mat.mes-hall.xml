      <title>Negative intercept of the apparent zero-temperature extrapolated linear-in-$T$ metallic resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the well-known phonon scattering induced high-temperature linear-in-$T$ metallic resistivity, showing that a naive extrapolation of the effective linearity from high temperatures to $T=0$ leads to an apparent zero-temperature negative resistivity. The precise magnitude of this extrapolated $T=0$ negative resistivity depends on the temperature regime from where the extrapolation is carried out, and approaches the correct physical result of zero resistivity at $T=0$ only if the extrapolation starts from $T\gg T_D$, where $T_D$ is the Debye temperature. We establish a theoretical relationship between the negative intercept and the slope of the linear-in-$T$ resistivity as a function of the temperature $T$ from where the extrapolation is carried out. Experimental implications of our finding are discussed for the much-discussed Planckian behavior of the transport scattering rate.</description>

      <title>Localization beyond Dirac and Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, providing a natural generalization to the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-s. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions, scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and the magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for even (odd) s. Remarkably, we find the localization correction to scale exponentially with s, i.e., faster moving electrons are strongly susceptible to disorder effects. This opens up intriguing possibility for Anderson localization and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <title>Strong current in carbon nanoconductors: Mechanical and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanoconductors are known to have extraordinary mechanical strength and interesting magnetic properties. Moreover, nanoconductors based on one- or two-dimensional carbon allotropes display a very high current-carrying capacity and ballistic transport. Here, we employ a recent, simple approach based on density functional theory to analyze the impact of strong current on the mechanical and magnetic properties of carbon nanoconductors. We find that the influence of the current itself on the bond-strength of carbon in general is remarkably low compared to e.g. typical metals. This is demonstrated for carbon chains, carbon nanotubes, graphene and polyacetylene. We can trace this to the strong binding and electronic bandstructure. On the other hand, we find that the current significanly change the magnetic properties. In particular, we find that currents in graphene zig-zag edge states quench the magnetism.</description>

      <title>Error-rate reduction in network-based biocomputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-based biocomputation (NBC) is an alternative parallel computing paradigm that encodes combinatorial problems into a nanofabricated device's graphical network of channels, enabling cytoskeletal filaments propelled by molecular motors to explore the problems' solution space. NBC promises to require significantly less energy than traditional computers due to the high energy efficiency of molecular motors. However, error rates associated with the pass junction crossing, the primary path-regulating geometry, pose a bottleneck for scaling up this technology. Here, we optimize the geometry of the pass junction for low error rates for the actin-myosin system. To do so, we evaluate various pass junction designs that differ in features, such as the nanochannel width, junction crossing area, and angles of a funnel-shaped output part of the junction. Error rates were measured experimentally by using gliding motility assay and as well as by simulation methods. The final optimized design displayed a decreased error rate of under 1 percent compared to the previous 2-4 percent. We anticipate this improvement will enable scaling up NBC networks from tens to hundreds of pass junctions. However, the results of 2D junction optimizations also suggest that further drastic reduction of error rates in two-dimensional pass junctions is unlikely, necessitating three-dimensional junctions, such as bridges or tunnels, for complete error rate mitigation. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that including a layer of myosin motor on the channel provides a better fit between simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Internodal excitonic state in a Weyl semimetal in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry consists of a pair of Weyl nodes located at wave vectors $\mathbf{K}_{\tau }=\tau \mathbf{b}$ in momentum space with $\tau =\pm 1$ the node index and chirality. The electronic dispersion near each node is linear. In a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ along $\mathbf{b}$, this dispersion is modified into a series of positive and negative energy Landau levels $n=\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots ,$which disperse along the direction of the magnetic field, and a chiral Landau level, $n=0$, with a linear dispersion given by $e_{\tau ,n=0}\left( k_{z}\right) =-\tau \hslash v_{F}k_{z},$ where $k_{z}$ is the component of the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ along the magnetic field and $v_{F}$ is the Fermi velocity. In the extreme quantum limit, the Fermi level is in the chiral levels near the Dirac point. When Coulomb interaction is considered, a Weyl semimetal may be unstable towards the formation of a condensate of internodal electron-hole pairs. In this article we use the full long-range Coulomb interaction and the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation to generate the condensed state. We study its stability with respect to a change in the Fermi velocity, doping and strength of the Coulomb interaction and also consider Weyl nodes with higher Chern number $C=2,3$. We derive the response functions of the excitonic state in the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). We show that, in the mean-field gap induced by the internodal coherence, there is, in the GRPA excitonic response, a series of bound electron-hole states with a binding energy that decreases until the Hartree-Fock energy gap is reached. In addition, there is a collective mode gapped at exactly the plasmon frequency: the gapless mode present in the proper excitonic response function is pushed to the plasmon frequency by the long-range Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing resonant second harmonic generation in bilayer WSe2 by layer-dependent exciton-polaron effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials serve as exceptional platforms for controlled second harmonic generation (SHG), an important nonlinear optical phenomenon with diverse applications. Current approaches to SHG control often depend on non-resonant conditions or symmetry breaking via single-gate control. Here, we employ dual-gate bilayer WSe2 to demonstrate a new SHG enhancement concept that leverages strong exciton resonance and layer-dependent exciton-polaron effect. By selectively localizing injected holes within one layer, we induce exciton-polaron states in the hole-filled layer while maintaining normal exciton states in the charge-neutral layer. The distinct resonant conditions of these layers effectively break interlayer inversion symmetry, thereby promoting resonant SHG. Our method achieves a remarkable 40-fold enhancement of SHG at minimal electric field, equivalent to conditions near the dielectric-breakdown threshold but using only ~3% of the critical breakdown field. Our findings also reveal significant sensitivity of resonant SHG to carrier density and carrier type, with distinct enhancement and quenching observed across different gating regimes. This advancement offers an innovative approach to manipulating SHG in 2D excitonic materials and provides a potent spectroscopic tool for probing layer-dependent quantum states.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding individual ions in solutions is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, tracking and detecting ions at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a challenge. We introduce a strategy for visualization and differentiation of different ions in liquid environment via point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the ion sensor. Ions interacting with the optically active point defects in h-BN alter emission properties, allowing us to capture these changes and visualize single ions. Using Li+ in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed a spectral shift of over 10 nm upon Li+ addition, and an over 50 nm red shift with applied electric fields due to reactions between Li+ and h-BN point defects. Frequency domain analysis further revealed the rapid dynamics of ion migration and the slow electrochemical reactions. We further spectroscopically differentiated various ions (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Al3+) in aqueous solution. Each ion, with its distinct electron cloud configuration, interacts distinctively with the electron clouds of h-BN defects, resulting in specific and identifiable spectroscopic signatures. This ion sensing platform enables the direct visualization and differentiation of individual ions in a liquid environment, offering insights into chemical reactions at the single-ion level. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids, including but not limited to biology, battery technology, and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Molecular Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures possessing {\pi}-electron magnetism have attracted tremendous interest due to their great potential for nano spintronics. In particular, quantum chains with magnetic molecular units synthesized by on-surface reactions provide an ideal playground for investigating magnetic exchange interactions between localized spin components. Here, we present an extensive study of antiferromagnetic nanographene chains with the diazahexabenzocoronene molecule as the repeating unit. A combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory and quantum spin models revealed their detailed structures and electronic and magnetic properties. We found that the antiferromagnetic chains host a collective state featuring gapped excitations for an even number of repeating units and one featuring a Kondo excitation for an odd number. Comparing with exact many-body quantum spin models, our molecular chains provide the realization of an entangled quantum Heisenberg model. Coupled with the tunability of the molecular building blocks, these systems can act as an ideal platform for the experimental realization of topological spin lattices.</description>

      <title>Low-Threshold Surface-Emitting Whispering-Gallery Mode Microlasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on microlasers based on high-quality micropillars with lasing on whispering-gallery modes. Usage of low-absorbing Al$\scriptsize 0.2$Ga$\scriptsize 0.8$As\Al$\scriptsize 0.9$Ga$\scriptsize 0.1$As distributed Bragg reflectors as well as the smooth pillar sidewalls allows us to realize whispering-gallery modes lasing by excitation and collection of emission in the pillar axis direction. As a result, simultaneous whispering gallery modes lasing (comb-like structure) in the wavelength range of 930-970 nm is observed for 3-7 $\mu$m pillar diameters. Increase the temperature up to 130 K results single-mode lasing for 5 $\mu$m pillars with about 8000 cold cavity quality-factor and 240 $\mu$W estimated threshold excitation power.</description>

      <title>Emerging supersolidity from a polariton condensate in a photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter where its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organisation. This exotic state of matter has been achieved in different systems using Bose-Einstein condensates coupled to cavities, possessing spin-orbit coupling, or dipolar interactions. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a novel non-equilibrium context based on exciton-polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound-in-the-continuum state with exceptionally low losses. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a remarkable precision of a few parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to additionally measure the local coherence of the superfluid component. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by Nb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <title>Observation of a stripe phase in a spin-orbit coupled exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bose-Einstein condensates, spin-orbit coupling produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour of weakly interacting Bose condensates, shows a periodic modulation of its density typical for crystals and called stripe phase. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of samples allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The structure is an optical microcavity filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) sandwiched between two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP. We demonstrate the formation of cavity exciton-polaritons in the presence of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC), which is tuned by external voltage controlling the LC birefringence. In the RDSOC regime, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion. The condensate real space distribution shows both polarization and density stripes, which stem from the interference between phase-coherent condensate components characterized by different wavevectors and polarizations. The possibilities offered by this platform to tune the particle dispersion and to perform full state tomography, including time-resolved, open wide perspectives for detailed future studies of the static and dynamical behaviour of supersolids and of quantum fluids in presence of SOC and topologically non-trivial bands.</description>

      <title>A robust theory of thermal activation in magnetic systems with Gilbert damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic systems can exhibit thermally activated transitions whose timescales are often described by an Arrhenius law. However, robust predictions of such timescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic theory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional spin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and deriving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real unstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the activation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\alpha$. We find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime of $\alpha\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent reorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius law by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a finite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends exponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the Meyer-Neldel rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of nonreciprocal superconductors where inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, giving rise to an asymmetric energy dispersion. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal superconductivity can be detected by Andreev reflection. In particular, a transparent junction between a normal metal and a nonreciprocal superconductor generally exhibits an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic, which serves as a defining feature of nonreciprocal superconductivity. Unlike the superconducting diode effects, our detection scheme has the advantage of avoiding large critical currents that turn the superconducting state to normal. Finally, we discuss candidates for nonreciprocal superconductivity, including graphene, UTe2, as well as engineered platforms.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model, we show that when the electron repulsion energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that electron repulsion is beneficial for the solar cell if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of interactions.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on high-harmonic generation in Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how many-body effects associated with background spin dynamics control the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in Mott insulators by analyzing the two-leg ladder Hubbard model. Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping $t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled ($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant spin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed by spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large $t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary excitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the nontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative differences to conventional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>In-situ topotactic chemical reaction for spectroscopies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topotactic chemical reaction (TCR) is a chemical process that transforms one crystalline phase to another while maintaining one or more of the original structural frameworks, typically induced by the local insertion, removal, or replacement of atoms in a crystal. The utilization of TCR in atomic-layer materials and surfaces of bulk crystals leads to exotic quantum phases, as highlighted by the control of topological phases, the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity, and the realization of 2D ferromagnetism. Advanced surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are leading techniques to visualize the electronic structure of such exotic states and provide us a guide to further functionalize material properties. In this review article, we summarize the recent progress in this field, with particular emphasis on intriguing results obtained by combining spectroscopies and TCR in thin films.</description>

      <title>Approximate symmetries, insulators, and superconductivity in continuum-model description of twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective confinement of light holes (LHs) in a tensile-strained germanium (Ge) quantum well is studied by mapping the electronic structure of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ heterostructures as a function of Sn content, residual strain, and Ge well thickness. It is shown that above $12\,\text{at.}\%$ Sn and below $0.4\%$ residual compressive strain in the barriers, the tensile strain in Ge becomes sufficiently large to yield a valence band edge with LH-like character, thus forming a quasi two-dimensional LH gas in Ge. The LH ground state has a larger in-plane effective mass than that of heavy holes (HHs) in Si$_{1-y}$Ge$_y$/Ge/Si$_{1-y}$Ge$_y$ quantum wells. Moreover, LHs in optimal Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ heterostructures are found to exhibit a strong $g$-tensor anisotropy, with the in-plane component one order of magnitude larger than that of HHs in typical planar systems. Two of three structure-inversion-asymmetry Rashba parameters, both of which are critical in electric-dipole-spin-resonance experiments, are effectively 10 times the size of the cubic Rashba parameter in HH quantum wells. In the regime of LH selective confinement, every layer of the heterostructure is of direct bandgap, which can be relevant for efficient optical photon-spin qubit interfaces. This work discusses the broad landscape of the characteristics of LH spin confined in Ge to guide the design and implementation of LH spin-based devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon Linewidths in Twisted Bilayer Graphene near Magic Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the phonon linewidths in twisted bilayer graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions and anharmonic effects. The electronic structure is calculated using distance-dependent transfer integrals based on the atomistic Slater-Koster tight-binding formalism, including electron-electron interactions treated at the Hartree level, and the phonons are calculated using classical force fields. These ingredients are used to calculate the phonon linewidths arising from electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, anharmonic effects on the linewidths are computed using the mode-projected velocity autocorrelation function obtained from classical molecular dynamics. We predict a moir\'e potential induced splitting of this mode, which arises due to contributions from high symmetry stacking regions. Our findings show that both electron-phonon and anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the linewidth of the Raman active G mode near the magic angle.</description>

      <title>Bright-Dark Exciton Interplay Evidenced by Spin Polarization in CdSe/CdMnS Nanoplatelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) colloidal nanocrystals demonstrate remarkable magneto-optical properties. However, the behavior of circular polarization of their emission in high magnetic fields remains unclear. We measure magneto-optical properties of colloidal CdSe/CdMnS nanoplatelets in high magnetic fields up to 30 T and at cryogenic temperatures. The degree of circular polarization of photoluminescence demonstrates non-monotonous behavior in a magnetic field. In low magnetic fields, the polarization degree is positive, due to an exchange interaction of excitons with localized spins of magnetic Mn ions. The exchange interaction is strong enough to overcome the intrinsic Zeeman splitting, which provides negatively polarized emission in nonmagnetic CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. After reaching a maximum the polarization degree starts to decrease and reverses the sign to negative in high magnetic fields. The critical magnetic field, in which the sign is reversed, increases when temperature is elevated. We develop a model, which explains this behavior by an interplay of bright and dark exciton recombination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce (symmetric) Tetranacci polynomials $\xi_j$ as a twofold generalization of ordinary Tetranacci numbers, by considering both non unity coefficients and generic initial values in their recursive definition. The issue of these polynomials arose in condensed matter physics and the diagonalization of symmetric Toeplitz matrices having in total four non-zero off diagonals. For the latter, the symmetric Tetranacci polynomials are the basic entities of the associated eigenvectors; thus, treating the recursive structure determines the eigenvalues as well. Subsequently, we present a complete closed form expression for any symmetric Tetranacci polynomial. The key feature is a decomposition in terms of generalized Fibonacci polynomials.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Interactions enable Thouless pumping in a nonsliding lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological 'Thouless' pump represents the quantised motion of particles in response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in physics because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be robust against perturbations and thus technologically useful. So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise a two-component Fermi gas in a dynamical superlattice which does not exhibit a sliding motion and remains trivial in the single-particle regime. However, when tuning interparticle interactions from zero to positive values, the system undergoes a transition from being stationary to drifting in one direction, consistent with quantised pumping in the first cycle. Remarkably, the topology of the interacting pump trajectory cannot be adiabatically connected to a non-interacting limit, highlighted by the fact that only one atom is transferred per cycle. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>High-rate intercity quantum key distribution with a semiconductor single-photon source</title>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the transmission of information that is secure against general attacks by eavesdroppers. The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 * 10^{-5} with an average quantum bit error ratio of ~ 0.65 % are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications.</description>

      <title>Collective photon emission in solid state environments: Concatenating non-markovian and markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective light emission and multi-qubit dynamics of solid-state quantum emitters are affected both by their coupling to the light field and to lattice vibrations. The effect of phonons on quantum emitters is twofold: polaron formation is described by ultrafast non-markovian dynamics, while slower dephasing is well described by exponential decay. Of the two temperature-dependent processes, the effect of the former on the collective emission and the entanglement decay of emitters is usually not modeled, and also the latter is sometimes neglected. Here we propose and compare two methods that are efficient also for several emitters: the first method concatenates the fast and slow phonon dynamics, and the second is the polaron method. For a single quantum emitter, we show that the dynamical equations are identical in both methods, while predictions for two or more emitters also agree very well. Both of our methods incorporate non-markovian dynamics due to phonons demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of the collective photon emission. Utilizing a simplified markovian model instead may not be accurate enough especially for quantum information applications: for example, we show how the markovian model may considerably overestimate the two-emitter concurrence, except at very low temperatures. Our concatenation and polaron methods can be applied to an arbitrary number and type of quantum emitters, and beyond the bulk GaAs environment that we consider here. Especially the concatenation method can take phonon effects into account at the same computational cost as modelling the emitter-photon interaction alone. Finally, we present approximate analytical expressions for the collective emission spectrum for $N$ emitters on a one-dimensional chain.</description>
