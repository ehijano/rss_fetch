      <title>A Computational Analysis and Visualization of In-Text Reference Networks Across Philosophical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied computational methods to analyze references across 2,245 philosophical texts, spanning from approximately 550 BCE to 1940 AD, in order to measure patterns in how philosophical ideas have spread over time. Using natural language processing and network analysis, we mapped over 294,970 references between authors, classifying each reference into subdisciplines of philosophy based on its surrounding context. We then constructed a graph, with authors as nodes and textual references as edges, to empirically validate, visualize, and quantify intellectual lineages as they are understood within philosophical scholarship. For instance, we find that Plato and Aristotle alone account for nearly 10% of all references from authors in our dataset, suggesting that their influence may still be underestimated. As another example, we support the view that St. Thomas Aquinas served as a synthesizer between Aristotelian and Christian philosophy by analyzing the network structures of Aquinas, Aristotle, and Christian theologians. Our results are presented through an interactive visualization tool, allowing users to dynamically explore these networks, alongside a mathematical analysis of the network's structure. Our methodology demonstrates the value of applying network analysis with textual references to study a large collection of historical works.</description>

      <title>Billions at Stake: How Self-Citation Adjusted Metrics Can Transform Equitable Research Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citation metrics serve as the cornerstone of scholarly impact evaluation despite their well-documented vulnerability to inflation through self-citation practices. This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns. Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition. Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%. This work contributes to the paradigm shift toward transparent, nuanced, and equitable research evaluation methodologies in academia, with direct implications for funding allocation decisions that collectively amount to over $100 billion annually in the United States alone.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Language Models for Lunar Mission Planning and In Situ Resource Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key factor for lunar mission planning is the ability to assess the local availability of raw materials. However, many potentially relevant measurements are scattered across a variety of scientific publications. In this paper we consider the viability of obtaining lunar composition data by leveraging LLMs to rapidly process a corpus of scientific publications. While leveraging LLMs to obtain knowledge from scientific documents is not new, this particular application presents interesting challenges due to the heterogeneity of lunar samples and the nuances involved in their characterization. Accuracy and uncertainty quantification are particularly crucial since many materials properties can be sensitive to small variations in composition. Our findings indicate that off-the-shelf LLMs are generally effective at extracting data from tables commonly found in these documents. However, there remains opportunity to further refine the data we extract in this initial approach; in particular, to capture fine-grained mineralogy information and to improve performance on more subtle/complex pieces of information.</description>

      <title>A citation index bridging Hirsch's h and Egghe's g</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a citation index $\nu$ (``nu'') and show that it lies between the classical $h$-index and $g$-index. This idea is then generalized to a monotone parametric family $(\nu_\alpha)$ ($\alpha\ge 0$), whereby $h=\nu_0$ and $\nu=\nu_1$, while the limiting value $\nu_\infty$ is expressed in terms of the maximum citation.</description>

      <title>Research Power Ranking: Adapting the Elo System to Quantify Scientist Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an original model for assessing scientific productivity, research power ranking, RPR, which is based on the adaptation of the Elo rating system to the context of scientific activity. Unlike traditional scientometric indicators, RPR accounts for the dynamics, multidimensionality, and relativity of research power. The model comprises three components fundamental, applied, and commercial activity each represented by a separate rating and updated on the basis of probabilistic scientific games analogous to chess matches. The scientific rating of each researcher is calculated as a weighted sum of the components, allowing the model to reflect not only their current position but also their career trajectory, including phase transitions, breakthroughs, and changes in scientific style. Numerical simulations were conducted for both the individual trajectories and population level distributions of the researchers. Phase diagrams were constructed, and a typology of scientific styles was formulated. The results demonstrate that RPR can serve as a universal tool for objective assessment, strategic planning, and visualization of scientific reputation in both academic and applied environments.</description>

      <title>Labeling Case Similarity based on Co-Citation of Legal Articles in Judgment Documents with Empirical Dispute-Based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report addresses the challenge of limited labeled datasets for developing legal recommender systems, particularly in specialized domains like labor disputes. We propose a new approach leveraging the co-citation of legal articles within cases to establish similarity and enable algorithmic annotation. This method draws a parallel to the concept of case co-citation, utilizing cited precedents as indicators of shared legal issues. To evaluate the labeled results, we employ a system that recommends similar cases based on plaintiffs' accusations, defendants' rebuttals, and points of disputes. The evaluation demonstrates that the recommender, with finetuned text embedding models and a reasonable BiLSTM module can recommend labor cases whose similarity was measured by the co-citation of the legal articles. This research contributes to the development of automated annotation techniques for legal documents, particularly in areas with limited access to comprehensive legal databases.</description>
