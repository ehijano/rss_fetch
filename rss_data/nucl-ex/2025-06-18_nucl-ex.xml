      <title>Charged-particle production in pp collisions at 13.6 TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at 5.36 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurements of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density, ${\rm d}N_{\rm{ch}}/{\rm d}\eta$, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13.6 TeV and in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = $ 5.36 TeV are presented. The analysis is based on Run 3 data recorded in 2022 and 2023, using the upgraded ALICE detector at the LHC. The average charged-particle pseudorapidity density $\langle{\rm d}N_{\rm{ch}}/{\rm d}\eta\rangle$ in pp collisions was measured at midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;$0.5) with the upgraded central barrel detectors, such as the Inner Tracking System and the Time Projection Chamber and, at forward pseudorapidity ($-$3.6 $&lt;|\eta|&lt;-$ 2.4), using the newly installed Muon Forward Tracker (MFT). For Pb-Pb collisions, the measurement was performed in different centrality classes, ranging from the most central 0-5$\%$) to the peripheral (70-80$\%$) collisions.</description>

      <title>Ambiguities in the Partial-Wave Analysis of the Photoproduction of Pairs of Pseudoscalar Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the technique of partial-wave analysis, there are cases where more than one set of underlying complex-valued amplitudes can describe the measured observables. These ambiguities can sometimes be resolved using additional information, but assumptions are often required. It is known that the partial-wave analysis of two-pseudoscalar meson systems produced in photoproduction with a linearly polarized photon beam is free from discrete ambiguities stemming from the Barrelet zeros when the nucleon spin is ignored. In this article, we show that continuous ambiguities are possible for certain wave sets, even though the discrete ambiguities do not appear. We also explore ways to resolve these ambiguities and determine the maximal amount of information that can be obtained from analyses that suffer from these continuous ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity nova explosions: a site for weak rp-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of quark effects in nuclei via bremsstrahlung analysis in the proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Background} (1) The incoherent emission of photons is dominant comparing to coherent one in proton-nucleus scattering. The incoherent bremsstrahlung is very sensitive to the magnetic moments of nucleons in nuclei. (2) According to the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, the nucleon magnetic moments in nuclei are enhanced relative to those in vacuum, originating from the quark structure of nucleons. \textbf{Purpose} Investigate possibilities of observing quark effects in nuclei by the analysis of bremsstrahlung in nuclear reactions. \textbf{Methods} Analyse the bremsstrahlung cross sections with established model in proton-nucleus scattering, by extending with inclusion of in-medium modified nucleon magnetic moments in nuclei by the QMC model. \textbf{Results} (1) After calibrating the model without the quark effects for experimental data (TAPS Collaboration data for $p + \isotope[197]{Au}$), we calculate the cross sections and observe the slight difference between the spectra for models with and without quark effects. Such result is found for the first time, confirming possibilities of observing the quark effects in the spectra of bremsstrahlung. (2) As found, quark effects are not enough to be observed in middle and heavy nuclei, as they have dominant incoherent contributions. (3) \isotope[18]{C} has minimal incoherent contribution concerning other carbon isotopes, where the quark effects should be minimal. In ratios between the spectra for \isotope[18]{C} and \isotope[12]{C} with and without the quark effects the difference is clearly observed. \textbf{Conclusions} We establish the new physical observable for the quark effects in nuclei in the bremsstrahlung accompanied in the nuclear reactions, which can be measured. The present suggestion is for the first time in both theoretically and experimentally to study the quark effects in nuclei via the bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Towards a microscopic description of nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of a comprehensive microscopic approach to describe nucleus-nucleus elastic collisions by means of an optical potential derived at first order in multiple-scattering theory and computed by folding the projectile and target nuclear densities with the nucleon-nucleon $t$ matrix, which describes the interaction between each nucleon of the projectile and each nucleon of the target. Chiral interactions are consistently used in the calculation of the $t$ matrix and of the nonlocal nuclear densities, which are computed within the ab initio no-core shell model. Cross sections calculated for $\alpha$ collisions on $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O at projectile energies in the range 100-300 MeV are presented and compared with available data. For momentum transfer $q$ up to about $1.0$ fm$^{-1}$ our results are in good agreement with the experimental data, whereas for higher momenta a reduction of the imaginary contributions is needed.</description>

      <title>Correlation studies of the $^{7}$He excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unbound nucleus $^{7}$He was recently studied in the $^2$H($^{6}$He,$^1$H)$^{7}$He reaction at 29 $A\,$MeV beam energy in Ref.[M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)]. The excitation spectrum of $^{7}$He was measured up to $E_T=8$ MeV ($E_T$ is energy above the $^{6}$He-$n$ threshold). Angular distribution for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay of the $^{7}$He $3/2^-$ ground state can be explained by a strong spin alignment induced by a reaction mechanism. The correlation information for the higher-lying $^{7}$He excitations is available as backward-forward asymmetry for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay in the $^{7}$He frame. The asymmetry function has an expressed energy profile which may be explained by using quite restrictive assumptions about structure of $^{7}$He excitations or/and peculiarities of the reaction mechanism. In the analysis of [M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)] the observation the $s_{1/2}$ state in $^{7}$He is declared with $E_r \approx 2.0$ MeV. Our work is based on the same $^{7}$He data. However, the data analysis was improved and also the data interpretation is substantiated with the detailed PWBA reaction studies and coupled-channel calculations of the $^{7}$He continuous spectrum. The idea of the $s_{1/2}$ resonant state with $E_r \approx 2.0$ is rejected. In addition, the position of the $1/2^-$ state in $^{7}$He is confined to the interval $E_r=2.2-3.0$ MeV, with ``preferred'' value 2.6 MeV. There is indication on the second $3/2^-$ state in the data with $E_r \sim 4.5$ MeV and with the lower resonance energy limit $E_r \gtrsim 3.5$ MeV. Importance and prospects of more detailed correlation studies of $^{7}$He continuum are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung Gamma Ray as a Probe of Short-Range Correlations in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei and dense nucleonic matter in neutron stars exhibit short-range correlations (SRCs), where nucleons form temporally correlated pair in close proximity. The impact of SRC on heavy-ion collisions (HICs) $-$which create dense nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratory$-$ has not been explored until now. In this letter, we present the neutron-proton bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray emission from HICs as a novel indicator of SRC in nuclei. By analyzing the hardening of the bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray spectrum, which results from the enhancement of high-momentum components above the Fermi surface in nucleon momentum distributions, we precisely determine the SRC fraction in nuclei to be $(20\pm7)\%$ at $3\sigma$ confidence level. This experiment provides the first direct and accurate signature of SRC in low-energy HICs, offering a new method to study the parton distribution function of nucleons in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and correlations of quark spin in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of QCD phase transitions on the quark spin fluctuations and correlations. We propose the quark-antiquark correlation, which relates to the vector meson spin alignment and the $\Lambda-\bar\Lambda$ correlation, can be used as a novel probe of the critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram. Using the Nambu-Jona-Lanisio model, we qualitatively study the properties of quark-antiquark spin correlations. Our findings reveal a peak structure near the CEP of the chiral phase transition, which may serve as an experimental signature of the CEP and account for the non-monotonic behavior of $\phi$ meson alignment at low collision energies observed recently in experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton polarization and dynamics of the QCD plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of the polarization of lepton pairs produced in $\sqrts = 5.02 $ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, using next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rates. These calculations employ a multi-stage framework to simulate the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to explore the sensitivity of polarization to early times. It is found that the intermediate invariant-mass dileptons are indeed probes of the thermal equilibration process, and go beyond the reach of hadronic observables. We compute the polarization anisotropy coefficient obtained with LO dilepton rates, and show that the LO and NLO results differ radically, both in trend and in magnitude, at low and intermediate lepton pair invariant masses.</description>

      <title>Mapped interacting boson model for nuclear structure studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present status of the mapped interacting boson model studies on nuclear structure is reviewed. With the assumption that the nuclear surface deformation induced by the multi-nucleon dynamics is simulated by bosonic degrees of freedom, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian that provides energy spectra and wave functions is determined by mapping the potential energy surface that is obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the energy density functional onto the corresponding energy surface of the boson system. This procedure has been shown to be valid in general cases of the quadrupole collective states, and has allowed for systematic studies on spectroscopic properties of medium-heavy and heavy nuclei, including those that are far from the line of $\beta$ stability. The method has been extended to study nuclear structure phenomena that include shape phase transitions and coexistence, octupole deformation and collectivity, and the coupling of the single-particle to collective degrees of freedom, which is crucial to describe structures of odd nuclei, and $\beta$ and $\beta\beta$ decays.</description>
