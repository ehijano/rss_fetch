      <title>The ring of real-valued functions which are continuous on a dense cozero set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T''(X)$ and $T'(X)$ denote the collections of all real-valued functions on $X$ which are continuous on a dense cozero set and on an open dense subset of $X$ respectively. $T''(X)$ contains $C(X)$ and forms a subring of $T'(X)$ under pointwise addition and multiplication. We inquire when $T''(X)=C(X)$ and when $T''(X)=T'(X)$. We also ponder over the question when is $T''(X)$ isomorphic to $C(Y)$ for some topological space $Y$. We investigate some algebraic properties of the ring, $T''(X)$ for a Tychonoff space $X$. We provide several characterisations of $T''(X)$ as a Von-Neumann regular ring. We define nowhere almost $P$-spaces using the ring $T''(X)$ and characterise it as a Tychonoff space which has no non-isolated almost $P$-points. We show that a Tychonoff space with countable pseudocharacter is a nowhere almost $P$-space and highlight that this condition is not superflous using the closed ordinal space.</description>

      <title>Invariants for metrisable locally compact Boolean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pierce identified 3 invariants of a compact metrisable Boolean space, derived from its Cantor-Bendixson sequence, that determine the space up to homeomorphism. For locally compact spaces we define an additional invariant, the compact rank, and show that these 4 invariants determine a locally compact metrisable Boolean space up to homeomorphism. We also identify which combinations of the 4 invariants can arise in practice.
  A Boolean ring and its associated Boolean space are primitive if the ring is disjointly generated by its pseudo-indecomposable (PI) elements. Spaces in this important sub-class of Boolean spaces can be well described (uniquely in the case of compact spaces) by an extended PO system (poset with a distinguished subset). We define the Cantor-Bendixson sequence and associated invariants for a PO system, and show that almost all of the invariant information for a primitive space can be recovered from that of an associated extended PO system.
  We also show how the primitivity of a Boolean space corresponds to a notion of primitivity of the additive measure associated with the rank function of a space, which in turn depends on the additive measure being sufficiently 'self-similar'. We use these ideas to develop a method for constructing non-primitive spaces.</description>
