      <title>Optimal execution on Uniswap v2/v3 under transient price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal liquidation of a large position on Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3 in discrete time. The instantaneous price impact is derived from the AMM pricing rule. Transient impact is modeled to capture either exponential or approximately power-law decay, together with a permanent component. In the Uniswap v2 setting, we obtain optimal strategies in closed-form under general price dynamics. For Uniswap v3, we consider a two-layer liquidity framework, which naturally extends to multiple layers. We address the problem using dynamic programming under geometric Brownian motion dynamics and approximate the solution numerically using a discretization scheme. We obtain optimal strategies akin to classical ones in the LOB literature, with features specific to Uniswap. In particular, we show how the liquidity profile influences them.</description>

      <title>Sharp Transitions and Systemic Risk in Sparse Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study contagion and systemic risk in sparse financial networks with balance-sheet interactions on a directed random graph. Each institution has homogeneous liabilities and equity, and exposures along outgoing edges are split equally across counterparties. A linear fraction of institutions have zero out-degree in sparse digraphs; we adopt an external-liability convention that makes the exposure mapping well-defined without altering propagation. We isolate a single-hit transmission mechanism and encode it by a sender-truncated subgraph G_sh. We define adversarial and random systemic events with shock size k_n = c log n and systemic fraction epsilon n. In the subcritical regime rho_out &lt; 1, we prove that maximal forward reachability in G_sh is O(log n) with high probability, yielding O((log n)^2) cascades from shocks of size k_n. For random shocks, we give an explicit fan-in accumulation bound, showing that multi-hit defaults are negligible with high probability when the explored default set is polylogarithmic. In the supercritical regime, we give an exact distributional representation of G_sh as an i.i.d.-outdegree random digraph with uniform destinations, placing it within the scope of the strong-giant/bow-tie theorem of Penrose (2014). We derive the resulting implication for random-shock systemic events. Finally, we explain why sharp-threshold machinery does not directly apply: systemic-event properties need not be monotone in the edge set because adding outgoing edges reduces per-edge exposure.</description>

      <title>Diversification Preferences and Risk Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio diversification is a cornerstone of modern finance, while risk aversion is central to decision theory; both concepts are long-standing and foundational. We investigate their connections by studying how different forms of diversification correspond to notions of risk aversion. We focus on the classical distinctions between weak and strong risk aversion, and consider diversification preferences for pairs of risks that are identically distributed, comonotonic, antimonotonic, independent, or exchangeable, as well as their intersections. Under a weak continuity condition and without assuming completeness of preferences, diversification for antimonotonic and identically distributed pairs implies weak risk aversion, and diversification for exchangeable pairs is equivalent to strong risk aversion. The implication from diversification for independent pairs to weak risk aversion requires a stronger continuity. We further provide results and examples that clarify the relationships between various diversification preferences and risk attitudes, in particular justifying the one-directional nature of many implications.</description>

      <title>Optimal dividend payout with path-dependent drawdown constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal dividend problem with a drawdown constraint in a Brownian motion model, requiring the dividend payout rate to remain above a fixed proportion of its historical maximum. This leads to a path-dependent stochastic control problem, as the admissible control depends on its own past values. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is a novel two-dimensional variational inequality with a gradient constraint, a type of problem previously only analyzed in the literature using viscosity solution techniques. In contrast, this paper employs delicate PDE methods to establish the existence of a strong solution. This stronger regularity allows us to explicitly characterize an optimal feedback control strategy, expressed in terms of two free boundaries and the running maximum surplus process. Furthermore, we derive key properties of the value function and the free boundaries, including boundedness and continuity. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results and to offer new financial insights.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
