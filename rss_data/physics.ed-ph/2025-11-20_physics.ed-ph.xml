      <title>A critical review of pre-post surveys designed to measure student epistemology in undergraduate science courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epistemology of science students, i.e., their beliefs about the nature of the knowledge they are learning, about what they have to do to learn it, and about how they will use that knowledge, often plays a powerful role in what they learn in their science courses. This perspective paper provides a broad overview of the theoretical frameworks, designs, and applications of online pre-post surveys that are available to assess the potential shifts in epistemic perspectives in undergraduate science courses. We pay particular attention to a recent survey for biology courses called the Maryland Biological Expectation Survey (MBEX). The MBEX was developed to probe four epistemic themes that are closely aligned with the Vision and Change initiative for reforming undergraduate biology education. This review is intended to inform STEM teachers about the availability of online epistemological surveys for evaluating the epistemic effects of their courses. These surveys can also help STEM education researchers readily evaluate how different pedagogies, classroom contexts, and other features of learning environments affect the epistemic perspectives of science students.</description>

      <title>Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</description>
