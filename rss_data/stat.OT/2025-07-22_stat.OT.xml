      <title>Survey Data Integration for Distribution Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integration of probabilistic and non-probabilistic samples for the estimation of finite population totals (or means) has recently received considerable attention in the field of survey sampling; yet, to the best of our knowledge, this framework has not been extended to cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimation. To address this gap, we propose a novel CDF estimator that integrates data from probability samples with data from, potentially big, nonprobability samples. Assuming that a set of shared covariates are observed in both, while the response variable is observed only in the latter, the proposed estimator uses a survey-weighted empirical CDF of regression residuals trained on the convenience sample to estimate the CDF of the response variable. Under some assumptions, we derive the asymptotic bias and variance of our CDF estimator and show that it is asymptotically unbiased for the finite population CDF if ignorability holds. Our empirical results imply that the proposed CDF estimator is robust to model misspecification under ignorability, and robust to ignorability under model misspecification; when both assumptions are violated, our residual-based CDF estimator still outperforms its `plug-in' mass imputation and naive siblings, albeit with noted decreases in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</description>
