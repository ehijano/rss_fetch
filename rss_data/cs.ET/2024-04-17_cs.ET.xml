      <title>Low-Complexity Block-Based Decoding Algorithms for Short Block Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity block-based encoding and decoding algorithms for short block length channels. In terms of the precise use-case, we are primarily concerned with the baseline 3GPP Short block transmissions in which payloads are encoded by Reed-Muller codes and paired with orthogonal DMRS. In contemporary communication systems, the short block decoding often employs the utilization of DMRS-based least squares channel estimation, followed by maximum likelihood decoding. However, this methodology can incur substantial computational complexity when processing long bit length codes. We propose an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block/segment encoding using First-Order RM Codes which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS/data power adjustment technique, we can bridge/reduce the performance gap and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

      <title>Embedding Privacy in Computational Social Science and Artificial Intelligence Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy is a human right. It ensures that individuals are free to engage in discussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline without fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or otherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical factor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on individuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced computational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if inappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to adverse effects for individuals - especially vulnerable groups - and society. We have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which further demonstrate the importance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to the field by discussing the role of privacy and the primary issues that researchers working in CSS, AI, data science and related domains are likely to face. It then presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participant privacy is best preserved in their research design, data collection and use, analysis, and dissemination of research results.</description>

      <title>Fork is All You Need in Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified programming model for heterogeneous computing systems. Such systems integrate multiple computing accelerators and memory units to deliver higher performance than CPU-centric systems. Although heterogeneous systems have been adopted by modern workloads such as machine learning, programming remains a critical limiting factor. Conventional heterogeneous programming techniques either impose heavy modifications to the code base or require rewriting the program in a different language. Such programming complexity stems from the lack of a unified abstraction layer for computing and data exchange, which forces each programming model to define its abstractions. However, with the emerging cache-coherent interconnections such as Compute Express Link, we see an opportunity to standardize such architecture heterogeneity and provide a unified programming model. We present CodeFlow, a language runtime system for heterogeneous computing. CodeFlow abstracts architecture computation in programming language runtime and utilizes CXL as a unified data exchange protocol. Workloads written in high-level languages such as C++ and Rust can be compiled to CodeFlow, which schedules different parts of the workload to suitable accelerators without requiring the developer to implement code or call APIs for specific accelerators. CodeFlow reduces programmers' effort in utilizing heterogeneous systems and improves workload performance.</description>
