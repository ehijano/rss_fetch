      <title>DNA Replication Timing, Genome Stability and Non-adaptive Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A correlation between karyotype diversity and species richness was first observed in mammals in 1980, and subsequently confirmed after controlling for phylogenetic signal. The correlation was attributed to submicroscopic factors, presumably operating at the level of the genome. At the same time, an unexpected association between mutation rates and substitution rates has been observed in all eukaryotes so far examined. One hypothesis to explain the latter observation proposed that neutral mutation (dS) and non-neutral (dN) substitution rates in gene codons co-vary according to genomic position, or location in the genome. Later, it was found that mutation and substitution rates in eukaryotes increase with DNA replication timing during the Synthetic phase, or S phase, of the cell cycle. In 1991, Motoo Kimura proposed a molecular theory of non-adaptive radiation (NAR). Accordingly, genetic drift plays a significant role in speciation, albeit in parallel to and in conjunction with natural selection. The following will examine the contribution of DNA replication timing and DNA repair factors to the relationship between species richness and karyotype diversity, and by extension, to the large variation in species richness across the mammalian Tree of Life.</description>

      <title>AMR-MoEGA: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using Mixture of Experts and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a mounting global health crisis, requiring rapid and reliable prediction frameworks that capture its complex evolutionary dynamics. Traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), while accurate, remains laborious and time-consuming, limiting its clinical scalability. Existing computational approaches, primarily reliant on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis, fail to account for evolutionary drivers such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genome-level interactions.
  This study introduces a novel Evolutionary Mixture of Experts (Evo-MoE) framework that integrates genomic sequence analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to model and predict AMR evolution. A Mixture of Experts model, trained on labeled genomic data for multiple antibiotics, serves as the predictive core, estimating the likelihood of resistance for each genome. This model is embedded as a fitness function within a Genetic Algorithm designed to simulate AMR development across generations. Each genome, encoded as an individual in the population, undergoes mutation, crossover, and selection guided by predicted resistance probabilities.
  The resulting evolutionary trajectories reveal dynamic pathways of resistance acquisition, offering mechanistic insights into genomic evolution under selective antibiotic pressure. Sensitivity analysis of mutation rates and selection pressures demonstrates the model's robustness and biological plausibility. Validation against curated AMR databases and literature evidence further substantiates the framework's predictive fidelity.
  This integrative approach bridges genomic prediction and evolutionary simulation, offering a powerful tool for understanding and anticipating AMR dynamics, and potentially guiding rational antibiotic design and policy interventions.</description>

      <title>A mark and recapture perspective on vaccination touchpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers large-scale vaccination campaigns, a major platform for vaccine access in a lot of the world, as a recapture estimate of the target population marked by routine immunization. Framing the campaign as a measurement, we learn about its properties, including the campaign's coverage of the target population and some implied sampling properties of post-campaign coverage surveys (PCCSs), the current gold-standard in implementation quality measurement.
  We develop this idea in the context of the 2023 measles campaign in Kano State, Nigeria, where we have detailed implementation data collected by vaccination teams involved in that effort. Looking specifically at the teams' tally sheets, the daily records of who they vaccinated, we find significant discrepancies between the recapture estimates and those from the corresponding PCCS. Exploring a variety of bias models applied to both the tally sheets and the PCCS helps clarify how anecdotal issues from the field relate to this discrepancy.
  Overall, we find that the tally sheets, despite being an unorthodox population sample, provide a tractable perspective on implementation and measurement, one that's in principle available nearly instantly and at high resolution for any vaccination touchpoint.</description>

      <title>Modeling Spatial Synchronization of Predator-Prey Oscillations via the XY Model under Demographic Stochasticity and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic predator-prey dynamics and their spatial phase synchronization using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model coupled across multiple patches. Combining stochastic simulations based on the Gillespie algorithm with analytical methods inspired by the XY model, we uncover fundamental mechanisms through which demographic noise and dispersal shape synchronization and phase transitions. This study offers a theoretical foundation for understanding and managing large-scale ecological synchrony and ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stochastic microorganism flocculation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of stochastic microorganism flocculation models. Given the strong influence of environmental and seasonal fluctuations that are present in these models, we propose a stochastic model that includes multiple layers of stochasticity, from small Brownian fluctuations, to possibly large changes due to environmental `shifts'. We are able to give a full classification of the asymptotic behavior of these models. New techniques had to be developed to prove the persistence and extinction of the process as the system is not in Kolmogorov form and, as a result, the analysis is significantly more involved.</description>

      <title>Unlocking tropical forest complexity: How tree assemblages in secondary forests boost biodiversity conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary forests now dominate tropical landscapes and play a crucial role in achieving COP15 conservation objectives. This study develops a replicable national approach to identifying and characterising forest ecosystems, with a focus on the role of secondary forests. We hypothesised that dominant tree species in the forest canopy serve as reliable indicators for delineating forest ecosystems and untangling biodiversity complexity. Using national inventories, we identified in situ clusters through hierarchical clustering based on dominant species abundance dissimilarity, determined using the Importance Variable Index. These clusters were characterised by analysing species assemblages and their interactions. We then applied object-oriented Random Forest modelling, segmenting the national forest cover using NDVI to identify the forest ecosystems derived from in situ clusters. Freely available spectral (Sentinel-2) and environmental data were used in the model to delineate and characterise key forest ecosystems. We finished with an assessment of distribution of secondary and old-growth forests within ecosystems. In Costa Rica, 495 dominant tree species defined 10 in situ clusters, with 7 main clusters successfully modelled. The modelling (F1-score: 0.73, macro F1-score: 0.58) and species-based characterisation highlighted the main ecological trends of these ecosystems, which are distinguished by specific species dominance, topography, climate, and vegetation dynamics, aligning with local forest classifications. The analysis of secondary forest distribution provided an initial assessment of ecosystem vulnerability by evaluating their role in forest maintenance and dynamics. This approach also underscored the major challenge of in situ data acquisition.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$. We augment these lower and upper bounds with an empirical analysis which shows that in practice significantly fewer than $k+1$ states are usually required.</description>

      <title>Threshold behavior of a social norm in response to error proneness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A social norm defines what is good and what is bad in social contexts, as well as what to do based on such assessments. A stable social norm should be maintained against errors committed by its players. In addition, individuals may have different probabilities of errors in following the norm, and a social norm would be unstable if it benefited those who do not follow the norm carefully. In this work, we show that Simple Standing, which has been known to resist errors and mutants successfully, actually exhibits threshold behavior. That is, in a population of individuals playing the donation game according to Simple Standing, the residents can suppress the invasion of mutants with higher error proneness only if the residents' own error proneness is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the population will be invaded by mutants that commit assessment errors more frequently, and a series of such invasions will eventually undermine the existing social norm. This study suggests that the stability analysis of a social norm may have a different picture if the probability of error itself is regarded as an individual attribute.</description>
