      <title>Unified Geometric, Fuzzy, and Computational Framework for Ternary Gamma Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim. This paper (Paper D) unifies the ideal-theoretic, computational, and homological layers developed in Papers A (Rao 2025), B (Rao 2025), and C (Rao 2025) into a geometric framework that includes fuzzy and computational geometries on the spectrum Spec_G(T) and derived invariants in TGMod.
  Scope. We construct structure sheaves and Grothendieck topologies adapted to ternary G-products, develop fuzzy and weighted sites, and prove dualities bridging primitive spectra, Schur-density embeddings, and derived functors Ext and Tor.
  Outcomes. We obtain comparison theorems between radical/primitive strata and cohomological supports, and supply computable criteria and algorithms for finite models.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Spectral Graph Theory: Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks via Biorthogonal Bases (Random-Walk Laplacian Formulation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator-theoretic dichotomy underlying diffusion on directed networks is \emph{symmetry versus non-self-adjointness} of the Markov transition operator. In the reversible (detailed-balance) regime, a directed random walk $P$ is self-adjoint in a stationary $\pi$-weighted inner product and admits orthogonal spectral coordinates; outside reversibility, $P$ is genuinely non-self-adjoint (often non-normal), and stability is governed by biorthogonal geometry and eigenvector conditioning. In this paper we develop a harmonic-analysis framework for directed graphs anchored on the random-walk transition matrix $P=D_{\mathrm{out}}^{-1}A$ and the random-walk Laplacian $L_{\mathrm{rw}}=I-P$. Using biorthogonal left/right eigenvectors we define a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) adapted to directed diffusion, propose a diffusion-consistent frequency ordering based on decay rates $\Re(1-\lambda)$, and derive operator-norm stability bounds for iterated diffusion and for BGFT spectral filters. We prove sampling and reconstruction theorems for $P$-bandlimited (equivalently $L_{\mathrm{rw}}$-bandlimited) signals and quantify noise amplification through the conditioning of the biorthogonal eigenbasis. A simulation protocol on directed cycles and perturbed non-normal digraphs demonstrates that asymmetry alone does not dictate instability; rather, non-normality and eigenvector ill-conditioning drive reconstruction sensitivity, making BGFT a natural analytical language for directed diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Post-Hopf algebroids, post-Lie-Rinehart algebras and geometric numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of post-Hopf algebroids, generalizing the pre-Hopf algebroids introduced in [Bronasco, Laurent, 2025] in the study of exotic aromatic S-series. We construct action post-Hopf algebroids through actions of post-Hopf algebras. We show that the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie-Rinehart algebra (post-Lie algebroid) is naturally a post-Hopf algebroid. As a byproduct, we construct the free post-Lie-Rinehart algebra using a magma algebra with a linear map to the derivation Lie algebra of a commutative associative algebra. Applications in geometric numerical integration on manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>Semiperfect rings with a Nakayama permutation: A survey of Double annihilator property and Size condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a semiperfect ring with essential socles, the Double annihilator property encodes that the top and socle have anti-isomorphic lattices of submodules, whereas the Size condition encodes that they are isomorphic as modules. Interest in both concepts, particularly for finite rings, was revived by coding theory, where they characterise QF rings and Frobenius rings, respectively. However, their shared origins date back to the work of T. Nakayama.
  We study these concepts through the lens of the Nakayama permutation, an invariant initially used to define (quasi-)Frobenius rings. We propose semiperfect rings as the setting for this study, treating them as the natural generalisation of finite rings, because they possess the characteristic decomposition of unity preserved by projection onto a semisimple top. This allows us to extend the utility of the Nakayama permutation beyond the classical Artinian setting.
  By analysing the Nakayama permutation in this broader context, we show that many classical properties of (quasi-)Frobenius rings are not exclusive to the finite case, but are special cases of the general behaviour of semiperfect rings with essential socles.
  We illustrate these results using B. J. M\"uller's representation of semiperfect rings as rings of formal matrices. The clear description of socles and tops in this setting provides a straightforward method for constructing counterexamples, such as quasi-Frobenius rings that are not Frobenius.</description>

      <title>Representing in Low Rank I: conjugacy, topological and homological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\operatorname{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\operatorname{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.
  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.
  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</description>

      <title>Notes on Simplifying the Construction of Barabanov Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To answer the question about the growth rate of matrix products, the concepts of joint and generalized spectral radius were introduced in the 1960s. A common tool for finding the joint/generalized spectral radius is the so-called extremal norms and, in particular, the Barabanov norm. The goal of this paper is to try to combine the advantages of different approaches based on the concept of extremality in order to obtain results that are simpler for everyday use. It is shown how the Dranishnikov-Konyagin theorem on the existence of a special invariant body for a set of matrices can be used to construct a Barabanov norm. A modified max-relaxation algorithm for constructing Barabanov norms, which follows from this theorem, is described. Additional techniques are also described that simplify the construction of Barabanov norms under the assumption that</description>
