      <title>Kolmogorov Modes and Linear Response of Jump-Diffusion Models: Applications to Stochastic Excitation of the ENSO Recharge Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of linear response theory for mixed jump-diffusion models, combining both Gaussian and L\'evy noise forcings that interact with the nonlinear dynamics. This class of models covers a broad range of stochastic chaos and complexity for which the jump-diffusion processes are a powerful tool to parameterize the missing physics or effects of the unresolved scales onto the resolved ones.
  By generalizing concepts such as Kolmogorov operators and Green's functions to this context, we derive fluctuation-dissipation relationships for such models. The system response can then be interpreted in terms of contributions from the eigenmodes of the Kolmogorov operator (Kolmogorov modes) decomposing the time-lagged correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. The underlying formulas offer a fresh look on the intimate relationships between the system's natural variability and its forced variability.
  We apply our theory to a paradigmatic El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) subject to state-dependent jumps and additive white noise parameterizing intermittent and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, key factors in the actual ENSO phenomenon. Such stochastic parameterizations are shown to produce stochastic chaos with an enriched time-variability. The Kolmogorov modes encoding the latter are then computed, and our Green's functions formulas are shown to achieve a remarkable accuracy to predict the system's response to perturbations.
  This work enriches Hasselmann's program by providing a more comprehensive approach to climate modeling and prediction, allowing for accounting the effects of both continuous and discontinuous stochastic forcing. Our results have implications for understanding climate sensitivity, detection and attributing climate change, and assessing the risk of climate tipping points.</description>

      <title>On building the state error covariance from a state estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14809v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently found with the aid of machine learning that for a variety of toy data assimilation systems with chaotic Lorenz-96 model it is possible to achieve a nearly-optimal data assimilation without carrying the state error covariance between cycles. This result does not look surprising on its own because not carrying covariance is the approach taken by standard 4D-Var, but it was found ``astonishing'' in the context of the machine learning-based system trained on the ensemble Kalman filter. This note proposes two algorithms for building the state error covariance from a state estimate that yield good performance and could be worked out by the deep learning-based system.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant effects in pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pilot-wave hydrodynamics concerns the dynamics of 'walkers,' droplets walking on a vibrating bath, and has provided the basis for the burgeoning field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We here explore a theoretical model of pilot-wave hydrodynamics that relaxes the simplifying assumption of resonance between the droplet and its pilot wave, specifically the assumption of a fixed impact phase between the bouncing drop and its wave field. The model captures both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the drop, allowing one to examine non-resonant effects for both free and constrained walkers. The model provides new rationale for a number of previously reported but poorly understood features of free walker motion in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, including colinear swaying at the onset of motion, intermittent walking, and chaotic speed oscillations, all of which are accompanied by sporadic changes in the impact phase of the bouncing drop. The model also highlights the degeneracy in the droplets' vertical dynamics, specifically, the possibility of two distinct bouncing phases and of switching between the two. Consideration of this degeneracy is critical to understanding the droplet dynamics and statistics emerging in confined geometries at high memory and the interaction of walking droplets with standing Faraday waves.</description>
