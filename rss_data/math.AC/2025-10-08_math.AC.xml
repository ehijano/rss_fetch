      <title>Comprehensive Restriction Algorithm for Hypergeometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm computing the restriction of a holonomic D-module to a linear subspace was given by T.Oaku in 1997. We consider a problem of computing the restriction for a given holonomic D-module with parameters. We will give a partial answer to the problem for general holonomic D-modules and an answer to hypergeometric holonomic D-modules.</description>

      <title>Splittings of Ideals of Points in $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I_\mathbb{X}$ be the bihomogeneous ideal of a finite set of points $\mathbb{X} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. The purpose of this note is to consider ``splittings'' of the ideal $I_\mathbb{X}$, that is, finding ideals $J$ and $K$ such that $I_\mathbb{X} = J+K$, where $J$ and $K$ have prescribed algebraic or geometric properties. We show that for any set of points $\mathbb{X}$, we cannot partition the generators of $I_\mathbb{X}$ into two ideals of points. The best case scenario is where at most one of $J$ or $K$ is an ideal of points. To remedy this we introduce the notion of unions of lines and ACM (Arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) points which allows us to say more about splittings. For a set $\mathbb{W}$ of unions of lines and ACM sets of points, we can write $I_\mathbb{W} = J + K$ where both $J$ and $K$ are ideals of unions of lines and ACM points as well. When $\mathbb{W}$ is a union of lines and ACM points, we discuss some consequences for the graded Betti numbers of $I_{\mathbb{W}}$ in terms of these splittings.</description>

      <title>Annihilation of cohomology over one dimensional almost Gorenstein rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, the cohomology annihilator ideal and the annihilator of the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules are two ideals closely related both with each other and the singularities of the ring. Kimura recently showed that the two ideals agree up to radicals. In this article, we give a sufficient condition for the two ideals to be equal. As an application, we show that the cohomology annihilator ideal of a one dimensional analytically unramified almost Gorenstein complete local ring agrees with the conductor ideal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the analytic spread of binomial edge ideals of finite simple graphs. We provide tight bounds for this invariant in general. For special families of graphs (e.g., closed graphs, pseudo-forests), we compute the exact value for the analytic spread of the corresponding binomial edge ideals via combinatorial and convex geometric means.</description>

      <title>Vanishing theorems for combinatorial geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish strong vanishing theorems for line bundles on wonderful varieties of hyperplane arrangements, and we show that the resulting positivity properties of Euler characteristics extend to all matroids. We achieve this by showing that every degeneration of a wonderful variety within the permutohedral toric variety is reduced and Cohen--Macaulay. The same holds for a larger class of subschemes in products of projective lines that we call "kindred," which are characterized by matroidal Hilbert polynomials. Our results give a new proof of the 20-year-old f-vector conjecture of Speyer and resolve the conjecture of Tohaneanu that higher order Orlik--Terao algebras are Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>The commutative algebra of congruence ideals and applications to number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, Wiles deployed a commutative algebra technique, namely a numerical criterion for detecting isomorphisms of rings. In our recent work we pick up on Wiles' work and generalize the numerical criterion to ``higher codimension''. A critical ingredient is a notion of congruence module in higher codimension: this has turned out to be a key definition whose utility extends beyond the role it plays in the numerical criterion. In this paper we trace the origin of some of the ideas that led to our work, both in number theory and commutative algebra, and new directions that emerge from it. We introduce a related notion of a congruence ideal, develop some commutative algebra needed to work with it, and hint at applications to number theory.</description>

      <title>Power Towers: Purely Inseparable Galois Theory and Foliations in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a purely inseparable Galois theory using non-derived commutative algebra. Our theory works on fields and on normal varieties. It says that a purely inseparable morphism corresponds to a finite (saturated) subalgebra of differential operators. Our approach unifies most of the literature about purely inseparable morphisms and shows new research directions.
  Indeed, our theory extends to a theory that covers all (saturated) subalgebras of differential operators. The extended theory gives a correspondence between the subalgebras and a new notion of \textbf{power towers}. A power tower is an object analogous to a foliation from differential geometry. In particular, it admits its own versions of many key results about foliations, such as a ``fibrations inject into foliations'' and a ``Frobenius theorem''. The latter has a nontrivial twist: the local structure is trivial at every point, but it may differ between points!
  In general, our analogy between power towers and foliations explains why purely inseparable morphisms are foliation-like, because these morphisms are power towers in an explicit way.
  Finally, we use our theory to produce a formula for pullbacks of canonical divisors for arbitrary purely inseparable morphisms. We use it to conclude some ``not-L{\"u}roth theorems'': if the characteristic is high enough, then any variety purely inseparably covered by an $n$-dimensional projective space has Iitaka dimension equal to $-\infty$ or $n$, i.e., it is not zero.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of cuts in ordered abelian groups and of ideals over valuation rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate existence, uniqueness and maximality of solutions $T$ for equations $S_1+T=S_2$ and inequalities $S_1+T\subseteq S_2$ where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are final segments of ordered abelian groups. Since cuts are determined by their upper cut sets, which are final segments, this gives information about the corresponding equalities and inequalities for cuts. We apply our results to investigate existence, uniqueness and maximality of solutions $J$ for equations $I_1 J=I_2$ and inequalities $I_1 J\subseteq I_2$ where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are ideals of valuation rings. This enables us to compute the annihilators of quotients of the form $I_1/I_2\,$.</description>

      <title>Generic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study forms $I=(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$, $\deg f_i=d_i$, in $F$ which is the free associative algebra $k\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n\rangle$ or the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, where $k$ is a field and $\deg x_i=1$ for all $i$. We say that $I$ has type $t=(n;d_1,\ldots,d_r)$ and also that $F/I$ is a $t$-presentation. For each prime field $k_0$ and type $t=(n;d_1,\ldots,d_r)$, there is a series which is minimal among all Hilbert series for $t$-presentations over fields with prime field $k_0$ and such a $t$-presentation is called generic if its Hilbert series coincides with the minimal one. When the field is the real or complex numbers, we show that a $t$-presentation is generic if and only if
  it belongs to a non-empty countable intersection $C$ of Zariski open subsets of the affine space, defined by the coefficients in the relations, such that all points in $C$ have the same Hilbert series.
  In the commutative case there is a conjecture on what this minimal series is, and we give a conjecture for the generic series in the non-commutative quadratic case (building on work by Anick). We prove that if $A=k\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n\rangle/(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$ is a generic quadratic presentation, then $\{ x_if_j\}$ either is linearly independent or generate $A_3$. This complements a similar theorem by Hochster-Laksov in the commutative case.
  Finally we show, a bit to our surprise, that the Koszul dual of a generic presentation is not generic in general. But if the relations have algebraically independent coefficients over the prime field, we prove that the Koszul dual is generic. Hereby, we give a counterexample of \cite[Proposition 4.2]{P-P}, which states a criterion for a generic non-commutative quadratic presentation to be Koszul. We formulate and prove a correct version of the proposition.</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field. We also discuss extension of differential operators to localizations of rings and modules, and to colocalizations of modules.</description>

      <title>Canonical traces of graded fiber products: applications to disconnected Stanley--Reisner rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Miyashita and Varbaro classified the canonical traces of Stanley--Reisner rings that are Gorenstein on the punctured spectrum, under the Cohen--Macaulay assumption. We aim to generalize the result to the non--Cohen--Macaulay case. First, we establish an explicit formula for the canonical trace of graded fiber products of Noetherian rings and apply it to Stanley--Reisner rings of disconnected simplicial complexes. This allows us to reduce the problem to the case of connected simplicial complexes. In that case, we succeed in weakening the Cohen--Macaulay assumption in their result to the Serre's condition $(S_2)$, obtaining a similar classification. Finally, by combining these results, we provide a description of the canonical trace of a Stanley--Reisner ring satisfying $(S_2)$.</description>
