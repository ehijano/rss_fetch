      <title>Isoscalar, isovector and orbital contributions in $M1$ transitions from analogous $M1$ and Gamow-Teller transitions in $T=\frac{1}{2}$ mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isoscalar and isovector components and their contributions to $M1$ transitions are discussed in the odd-$A$, $T=1/2$ mirror nuclei with mass ranging from $A=23$ to 37. The orbital contributions in various $M1$ transitions and ground state magnetic moments are calculated by comparing analogous $M1$ and Gamow-Teller transitions between mirror pairs. The orbital contributions in different $M1$ transitions are explained on the basis of configurations of the initial and final states involved. In magnetic moments, the orbital contributions are found to be dependent on the deformation and single-particle nature of the states. All the $T=1/2$ mirror pairs are studied using isospin non-conserving interaction. The results are also compared with predictions from \textit{ab initio} effective interaction derived from realistic nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Pion gravitational form factors in the QCD instanton vacuum II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the hard QCD contributions to the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs), in terms of the twist-2,3 pion distribution amplitudes (DA), including novel semi-hard contributions from the instantons. The pion DAs are evaluated in the QCD instanton vacuum, and then properly evolved to higher resolution. The results are compared to our recent results from the QCD instanton vacuum, as well as Bethe-Salpeter calculations and recent lattice data. The interpolated hard and soft contributions to the pion D-form-factor, are used to derive the (gravitational) pressure and shear within the pion, with a clear delineation of their range.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on hadron yield ratios and fluctuations in hadron resonance gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas by performing calculations within an updated version of the open-source Thermal-FIST package. The presence of the magnetic field has a sizable influence on certain hadron yield ratios. Most notably, it leads to enhanced $ p/pi$ and suppressed $n/p$ ratios, which may serve as a magnetometer in heavy-ion collisions. By attributing the centrality dependence of the $p/\pi$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV measured by the ALICE Collaboration entirely to the magnetic field, we estimate its maximal strength at freeze-out to be $eB \simeq 0.12$~GeV$^2 \simeq 6.3 m_\pi^2$ in peripheral collisions. The magnetic field also enhances various conserved charge susceptibilities, which is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice QCD data and is driven in the HRG model by the increase of hadron densities. However, the variances of hadrons do not show any enhancement when normalized by the means, therefore, measurements of second-order fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions do not appear to offer additional information about the magnetic field relative to mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear deformation effects in photoproduction of $\rho$ mesons in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions between $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ and $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, employing the dipole model with the equivalent photon approximation. By implementing the Woods-Saxon distribution to represent the nuclear mass density, which is derived from density functional theory with an inclusion of nuclear deformation effects, we have calculated the transverse momentum $q_{T}$ spectra in isobaric collisions. We observe the characteristic dip behavior in these spectra, indicative of diffraction phenomena in high-energy physics. We notice that the deformation effects cause a nearly linear increase with $q_{T}^{2}$ for $q_{T}^{2}\lesssim0.015$ $\textrm{GeV}^{2}$, aligning with experimental observations. We offer a simple explanation for the observed behavior in these spectra by introducing the effective width of the nuclei in the thickness function. We also extend our discussion on the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction with the targets $^{63}\textrm{Cu}$,$^{197}\textrm{Au}$, and $^{238}\textrm{U}$.</description>

This contribution presents a selection of recent jet-substructure measurements from experiments at the LHC, in particular, soft-drop groomed radii of jets and reclustered large-radius jets from ATLAS, jet axis difference and generalized jet angularities from ALICE, as well as dijet shapes and b-jet shapes from the CMS experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors as well as the corresponding generalized parton distributions of the electron using the Basis Light-front Quantization approach to QED. We compare our results with those from light-front perturbation theory. We adopt a novel basis with its scale depending on the constituents' longitudinal momentum fraction. We show that this basis improves convergence of the form factors with increasing basis dimension, compared to that calculated in the original basis with fixed scale. These results both validate the BLFQ approach and provide guidance for its efficient implementation in solving light-front Hamiltonian mass eigenstates for more complex systems in QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical manner for the first time. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value with no source term. In particular, we deal with the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, just corresponding to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into each of $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method where gauge configurations around each vacuum are separately used. We eventually obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <title>From Neurons to Neutrons: A Case Study in Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) promises a path toward fully understanding how neural networks make their predictions. Prior work demonstrates that even when trained to perform simple arithmetic, models can implement a variety of algorithms (sometimes concurrently) depending on initialization and hyperparameters. Does this mean neuron-level interpretability techniques have limited applicability? We argue that high-dimensional neural networks can learn low-dimensional representations of their training data that are useful beyond simply making good predictions. Such representations can be understood through the mechanistic interpretability lens and provide insights that are surprisingly faithful to human-derived domain knowledge. This indicates that such approaches to interpretability can be useful for deriving a new understanding of a problem from models trained to solve it. As a case study, we extract nuclear physics concepts by studying models trained to reproduce nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Lithium abundance problem in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the three testaments in favor of the big bang theory is the prediction of the primordial elemental abundances in the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The Standard BBN is a parameter-free theory due to the precise knowledge of the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe obtained from studies of the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation. Although the computed abundances of light elements during primordial nucleosynthesis and those determined from observations are in good agreement throughout a range of nine orders of magnitude, there is still a disparity of $^7$Li abundance overestimated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ when calculated theoretically. The number of light neutrino flavors, the neutron lifetime and the baryon-to-photon ratio in addition to the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates determine the primordial abundances. We previously looked into the impact of updating baryon-to-photon ratio and neutron lifetime and changing quite a few reaction rates on the yields of light element abundances in BBN. In this work, calculations are performed using new reaction rates for $^3$H(p,$\gamma$)$^4$He, $^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be, $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B, $^{13}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{14}$O, $^7$Li(n,$\gamma$)$^8$Li and $^{11}$B(n,$\gamma$)$^{12}$B along with the latest measured value of neutron lifetime. We observe from theoretical calculations that these changes result in improvement by causing further reduction in the abundance of $^7$Li than calculated earlier.</description>

      <title>The European Muon Collaboration effect from short-range correlated nucleons in a nucleon swelling model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between the nuclear EMC effect and the nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation is a hot topic in high-energy nuclear physics, ever since a peculiar linear correlation between these two phenomena discovered. In this paper, the contribution to the nuclear EMC effect arising from the short-range correlated nucleons is examined in a nucleon-swelling model. We find that the structure modifications of the N-N SRC nucleons reproduce more or less the measured EMC ratios of light nuclei, while they are not enough to explain the measured EMC ratios of heavy nuclei. We speculate that the hypothesis of causal connection between SRC and the EMC effect is not exact, or the universality of the inner structure of SRC nucleon is violated noticeably from light to heavy nuclei, or there are other origins for the EMC effect.</description>

Abstract: We present comparisons to experimental data along with predictions of observables for U+U collisions at 193 GeV using a multistage theoretical and computational framework consisting of boost-invariant IP-Glasma initial state, MUSIC hydrodynamics, and a hadronic transport cascade generated by iS3D \&amp; SMASH. Our results show great agreement with existing anisotropic flow measurements from RHIC [ arXiv:1505.07812 ; arXiv:1901.08155 ] . We provide predictions for differential flow observables as well as multiparticle correlations and transverse-momentum-flow correlations. When possible, we compare our predictions to results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV to properly outline the effects of deformation in the initial state on final state observables.</description>

      <title>Deciphering yield modification of hadron-triggered semi-inclusive recoil jets in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a hot and dense state of matter, called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is produced. Semi-inclusive jets recoiling from trigger hadrons of high transverse momenta ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) can serve as an effective probe of the QGP properties, as they are expected to experience jet quenching when traversing the QGP. Recent experimental results on the ratio of recoil jet yields normalized by the trigger counts in heavy-ion collisions to that in $p$+$p$ collisions ($I_{\mathrm{AA}}$) pose an unexpected challenge in its interpretation. It is observed that $I_{\mathrm{AA}}$ rises with the jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and possibly exceeds unity at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, while traditionally it is expected that jet quenching would lead to $I_{\mathrm{AA}} &lt; 1$. To address this challenge, we utilize the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model to simulate jet transport in the QGP, and study the effect of jet quenching for high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ triggers and recoil jets separately on $I_{\mathrm{AA}}$. We find that the quenching of the colored triggers alone is responsible for the rising trend and larger-than-unity value observed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidences are updated and strengthened for the two-scales picture of low-energy nucleon structure as a compact `hard' valence quark core surrounded by a `soft' cloud of quark-antiquark pairs (the meson cloud). These considerations are quantified by a spectral analysis of the mean-squared radii associated with the isoscalar and isovector electric form factors of the nucleon. Further supporting arguments come from corresponding studies of the axial and mass form factors and their inferred radii. Separating low-mass (mesonic) and high-mass (short-range) contributions in the spectral representations of each of these form factors, we conclude that a central core with an r.m.s. radius of about 1/2 fm results consistently as the common feature in all cases. Implications are discussed for baryonic matter at densities beyond that of equilibrium nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Inter-band B(E1) Strengths in Heavy Nuclei based on the Proxy-SU(3) Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational bands of positive and negative parity are frequently found experimentally in heavy deformed even-even nuclei along with their corresponding $E2$ intra-band and $E1$ inter-band transitions. In $SU(3)$ symmetry-based models, calculating the $B(E2)$ strengths is relatively straightforward due to the relation between the $E2$ operator and the quadrupole generator of the algebra. However, calculating the $B(E1)$ strengths is a more difficult task, requiring computations involving the shell-model expansion of the dipole operator and multi-shell matrix elements. In this work the $E1$ operator is expanded in $SU(3)$ second quantization and applied to calculate the inter-band $B(E1)$ strengths of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the recently proposed proxy-$SU(3)$ scheme.</description>

Abstract: In nuclear and particle physics, reconciling sophisticated simulations with experimental data is vital for understanding complex systems like the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, computational demands pose challenges, motivating using Gaussian Process emulators for efficient parameter extraction via Bayesian calibration. We conduct a comparative analysis of Gaussian Process emulators in heavy-ion physics to identify the most adept emulator for parameter extraction with minimal uncertainty.

      <title>Electrical conductivity of warm neutron star crust in magnetic fields: Neutron-drip regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the anisotropic electrical conductivity tensor of the inner crust of a compact star at non-zero temperature by extending a previous work on the conductivity of the outer crust. The physical scenarios, where such crust is formed, involve proto-neutron stars born in supernova explosions, binary neutron star mergers and accreting neutron stars. The temperature-density range studied covers the transition from a non-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes that the nuclei form a liquid, i.e., the temperature is above the melting temperature of the lattice of nuclei. The electronic transition probabilities include (a) the dynamical screening of electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation for the QED plasma, (b) the correlations of the ionic component in a one-component plasma, and (c) finite nuclear size effects. The conductivity tensor is obtained from the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation accounting for the anisotropies introduced by a magnetic field. The sensitivity of the results towards the matter composition of the inner crust is explored by using several compositions of the inner crust which were obtained using different nuclear interactions and methods of solving the many-body problem. The standard deviation of relaxation time and components of the conductivity tensor from the average are below $\le 10\%$ except close to crust-core transition, where non-spherical nuclear structures are expected. Our results can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD result for the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron. Our calculation includes both quark-connected and -disconnected diagrams and assesses all sources of systematic uncertainties arising from excited-state contributions, finite-volume effects and the continuum extrapolation. At the physical point, we obtain for the proton $r_Z^p = ( 1.013 \pm 0.010\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_F^p = ( 1.301 \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.014\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$. These numbers suggest small values of the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton, but are compatible with most of the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor of the dilute (3+1)D Glasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a succinct formulation of the energy-momentum tensor of the Glasma characterizing the initial color fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We derive concise expressions for the (3+1)D dynamical evolution of symmetric nuclear collisions in the weak field approximation employing a generalized McLerran-Venugopalan model with non-trivial longitudinal correlations. Utilizing Monte Carlo integration, we calculate in unprecedented detail non-trivial rapidity profiles of early-time observables at RHIC and LHC energies, including transverse energy densities and eccentricities. For our setup with broken boost invariance, we carefully discuss the placement of the origin of the Milne frame and interpret the components of the energy-momentum tensor. We find longitudinal flow that deviates from standard Bjorken flow in the (3+1)D case and provide a geometric interpretation of this effect. Furthermore, we observe a universal shape in the flanks of the rapidity profiles regardless of collision energy and predict that limiting fragmentation should also hold at LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>A domain wall and chiral edge currents in holographic chiral phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatially inhomogeneous solutions in a top-down holographic model: the D3/D7 model which provides a holographic description of the chiral phase transition for a finite external magnetic field, chemical potential, and temperature. We numerically find a domain wall (or kink) solution in the three dimensional space, which incorporates between the chiral symmetry broken phase at the spatial infinity, under the homogeneous sources. Along with the inhomogeneity of the chiral condensate, the charge density is also spatially modulated. The modulated charge density and finite magnetic field lead to the chiral edge current close to the domain wall. We explore the dependences of those profiles on the chemical potential and temperature near the first and second order phase transition points. Our results indicate that the inhomogeneous solutions we found are in good agreement with those obtained by the Ginzburg--Landau theory in the vicinity of the transition points.</description>

      <title>Revisiting shear stress tensor evolution: Non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop second-order relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) derived from kinetic theory within an extended relaxation time approximation (momentum/energy dependent) for the collision kernel. The investigation involves a detailed examination of shear stress tensor evolution equations and associated transport coefficients. The Boltzmann equation is solved using a Chapman-Enskog-like gradient expansion for a charge-conserved conformal system, incorporating a momentum-dependent relaxation time. The derived relativistic non-resistive, viscous second-order MHD equations for the shear stress tensor reveal significant modifications in the coupling with dissipative charge current and magnetic field due to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. By utilizing a power law parametrization to quantify the momentum dependence of the relaxation time, the anisotropic magnetic field-dependent shear coefficients in the Navier-Stokes limit have been investigated. The resulting viscous coefficients are seen to be sensitive to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is essential in many fields of physics like dark matter searches, neutrino studies, nuclear astrophysics and medical physics. This white paper provides a review of the current landscape of (${\alpha}$, n) yields, neutron spectra and correlated ${\gamma}$-rays calculations, and describes the existing tools and the available cross-sections. The uncertainties that contribute to (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations are also discussed with plans for a program to improve the accuracy of these estimates. Novel ideas to measure (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of materials of interest are presented. The goal of this study is to reduce the uncertainty in the expected sensitivity of next-generation physics experiments in the keV--MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Pole structure of $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ via machine learning and uniformized S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probed the pole structure of the $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ using a trained deep neural network. The training dataset was generated using uniformized independent S-matrix poles to ensure that the obtained interpretation is as model-independent as possible. To prevent possible ambiguity in the interpretation of the pole structure, we included the contribution from the off-diagonal element of the S-matrix. Five out of the six neural networks we trained favor $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ as possibly having a three-pole structure, with one pole on each of the unphysical sheets - a first in its report. The two poles can be associated to a pole-shadow pair which is a characteristic of a true resonance. On the other hand, the last pole is most likely associated with the coupled-channel effect. The combined effect of these poles produced a peak below the $\Sigma^{+}_C\bar{D}^0$ which mimic the line shape of a hadronic molecule.</description>
