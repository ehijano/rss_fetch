      <title>MorphText: Deep Morphology Regularized Arbitrary-shape Scene Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up text detection methods play an important role in arbitrary-shape scene text detection but there are two restrictions preventing them from achieving their great potential, i.e., 1) the accumulation of false text segment detections, which affects subsequent processing, and 2) the difficulty of building reliable connections between text segments. Targeting these two problems, we propose a novel approach, named ``MorphText", to capture the regularity of texts by embedding deep morphology for arbitrary-shape text detection. Towards this end, two deep morphological modules are designed to regularize text segments and determine the linkage between them. First, a Deep Morphological Opening (DMOP) module is constructed to remove false text segment detections generated in the feature extraction process. Then, a Deep Morphological Closing (DMCL) module is proposed to allow text instances of various shapes to stretch their morphology along their most significant orientation while deriving their connections. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging benchmark datasets (CTW1500, Total-Text, MSRA-TD500 and ICDAR2017) demonstrate that our proposed MorphText outperforms both top-down and bottom-up state-of-the-art arbitrary-shape scene text detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Distinctiveness and Fidelity of the Descriptions Generated by Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are gaining traction for their remarkable ability to process and integrate visual and textual data. Despite their popularity, the capacity of LVLMs to generate precise, fine-grained textual descriptions has not been fully explored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on \textit{distinctiveness} and \textit{fidelity}, assessing how models like Open-Flamingo, IDEFICS, and MiniGPT-4 can distinguish between similar objects and accurately describe visual features. We proposed the Textual Retrieval-Augmented Classification (TRAC) framework, which, by leveraging its generative capabilities, allows us to delve deeper into analyzing fine-grained visual description generation. This research provides valuable insights into the generation quality of LVLMs, enhancing the understanding of multimodal language models. Notably, MiniGPT-4 stands out for its better ability to generate fine-grained descriptions, outperforming the other two models in this aspect.

      <title>Semantically consistent Video-to-Audio Generation using Multimodal Language Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing works have made strides in video generation, but the lack of sound effects (SFX) and background music (BGM) hinders a complete and immersive viewer experience. We introduce a novel semantically consistent v ideo-to-audio generation framework, namely SVA, which automatically generates audio semantically consistent with the given video content. The framework harnesses the power of multimodal large language model (MLLM) to understand video semantics from a key frame and generate creative audio schemes, which are then utilized as prompts for text-to-audio models, resulting in video-to-audio generation with natural language as an interface. We show the satisfactory performance of SVA through case study and discuss the limitations along with the future research direction.

      <title>NAI$_2$: Learning Noise-Aware Illumination-Interpolator for Unsupervised Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) techniques have made notable advancements in preserving image details and enhancing contrast, achieving commendable results on specific datasets. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter persistent challenges in efficiently mitigating dynamic noise and accommodating diverse low-light scenarios. Insufficient constraints on complex pixel-wise mapping learning lead to overfitting to specific types of noise and artifacts associated with low-light conditions, reducing effectiveness in variable lighting scenarios. To this end, we first propose a method for estimating the noise level in low light images in a quick and accurate way. This facilitates precise denoising, prevents over-smoothing, and adapts to dynamic noise patterns. Subsequently, we devise a Learnable Illumination Interpolator (LII), which employs learnlable interpolation operations between the input and unit vector to satisfy general constraints between illumination and input. Finally, we introduce a self-regularization loss that incorporates intrinsic image properties and essential visual attributes to guide the output towards meeting human visual expectations. Comprehensive experiments validate the competitiveness of our proposed algorithm in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Notably, our noise estimation method, with linear time complexity and suitable for various denoisers, significantly improves both denoising and enhancement performance. Benefiting from this, our approach achieves a 0.675dB PSNR improvement on the LOL dataset and 0.818dB on the MIT dataset on LLIE task, even compared to supervised methods.</description>
