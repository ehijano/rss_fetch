      <title>Predictors and Socio-Demographic Disparities in STEM Degree Outcomes: A ten-year UK study using Hierarchical Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research study uses hierarchical logistic regression to identify predictors of first-class STEM degree outcomes at a research-intensive Russell Group university in the UK between 2012 and 2022. By building a multivariate binary logistic model with random intercepts for different STEM degree subjects, we find that prior academic attainment, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age, and course duration are statistically significant predictors of achieving a first-class degree. By determining the odds ratios and average marginal effects of socio-demographic predictors, we find evidence for the existence of age, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic awarding gaps. The largest awarding gap exists between Black and White students, with Black students having 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.30-0.68) times the odds, and a 14\% lower probability, of achieving a first-class degree compared to White students, holding all other variables constant. Students who graduate from 4-year degrees are found to have, on average, a 27\% higher probability of achieving a first-class degree than students on 3-year degrees. Despite raw data suggesting that male students outperform female students, the multivariate hierarchical analysis revealed higher odds for female students after controlling for other factors and accounting for nested data structures. Analysis using year-specific average marginal effects indicates that awarding gaps have not significantly changed between 2012 and 2022. This research study provides a robust analytical framework for use by other departments and institutions aiming to identify and address awarding gaps.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relativistic World of Electromagnetism on Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for All: Online Courses Built Around Interactive Visual Quantum Circuit Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a highly abstract scientific discipline, which, however, is expected to have great practical relevance in future information technology. This forces educators to seek new methods to teach quantum computing for students with diverse backgrounds and with no prior knowledge of quantum physics. We have developed an online course built around an interactive quantum circuit simulator designed to enable easy creation and maintenance of course material with ranging difficulty. The immediate feedback and automatically evaluated tasks lowers the entry barrier to quantum computing for all students, regardless of their background.</description>
