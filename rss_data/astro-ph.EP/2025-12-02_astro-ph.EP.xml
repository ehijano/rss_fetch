      <title>Astrometric view of companions in the inner dust cavities of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as "transition disks") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.01$ at $\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M &gt; 30$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M &lt; 13$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

      <title>First Astrometric Limits on Binary Planets and Exomoons orbiting $\beta$ Pictoris b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exomoons, or moons in other star systems, has attracted significant interest in recent years, driven both by advancements in detection sensitivity and by the expanding population of known exoplanets. The $\beta$ Pictoris system is a particularly favorable target, as its proximity and directly imaged planets allow for precise astrometric monitoring. We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $\beta$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $\beta$ Pictoris b. We find that for short orbital periods ($\approx50$ days), a lunar companion is only allowed if its mass remains below $\approx 180~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.6~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At intermediate periods near 300 days, we exclude moons more massive than $\approx 65~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.2~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At longer orbital periods, we place the tightest constraints, ruling out any potential exomoon above $\approx 50~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.15~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $700$ days and $\approx 30~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.1~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $1,100$ days (both at $3\sigma$ confidence). These results place the first astrometric constraints on moons and binary planets in the $\beta$ Pictoris system and demonstrate the sensitivity of interferometric observations for exomoon studies.</description>

      <title>Outward Migration of a Gas Accreting Planet: A Semi-Analytical Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II orbital migration is a key process to regulate the mass and semimajor axis distribution of exoplanetary giant planets. The conventional formula of type II migration generally predicts too rapid inward migration to reconcile with the observed pile-up of gas giant beyond 1 au. Analyzing the recent high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations by Li et al. (2024) and Pan et al. (2025) that show robust outward migration of a gas accreting planet, we here clarify the condition for the outward migration to occur and derive a general semi-analytical formula that can be applied for broad range of planet mass and disk conditions. The striking outward migration is caused by azimuthal asymmetry in corotation torque exerted from cicumplanetary disk regions (connecting to horseshoe flow) that is produced by the planetary gas accretion, while the conventional inward migration model is based on radial asymmetry in the torques from the circumstellar protoplanetry disk. We found that the azimuthal asymmetry dominates and the migration is outward, when the gap depth defined by the surface density reduction factor of $1/(1+K')$ is in the range of $0.03 \lesssim K' \lesssim 50$. Using simple models with the new formula, we demonstrate that the outward migration plays an important role in shaping the mass and semimajor axis distribution of gas giants. The concurrent dependence of planets' accretion rate and migration direction on their masses and disk properties potentially reproduces the observed pile-up of exoplanetary gas giants beyond 1 au, although more detailed planet population synthesis calculations are needed in the future.</description>

      <title>Physicochemical Controls on the Compositions of the Earth and Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fact that the terrestrial planets formed from the protoplanetary disk, their compositions show marked departures from that of solar nebula condensates. Metallic cores fix oxygen fugacities ($f$O$_2$s) of the planets to 5 (Mercury) to 1 log units below the iron-w\"ustite (IW) buffer, orders of magnitude higher than the nebular gas. Their oxidised character is coupled with a lack of volatile elements with respect to the solar nebula. Condensates from a solar gas at different temperatures ($T_0$) have Fe/O (by mass) of 0.93 ($T_0$ = 1250 K) to 0.81 ($T_0$ = 400 K), far lower than that of Earth (1.06). Because the reaction Fe(s) + H2O(g) = FeO(s) + H2(g) proceeds &lt;600 K, temperatures at which most moderately volatile elements (MVEs) have condensed, oxidised planets should be volatile-rich, and vice-versa. That this is not observed suggests that planets did not accrete from equilibrium nebular condensates and/or underwent additional volatile depletion/$f$O$_2$ changes. Indeed, MVEs in small telluric bodies (Moon, Vesta) indicate near equilibrium evaporation/condensation at IW-1 and 1400-1800 K. Volatile-depleted elemental yet near-chondritic isotopes of larger telluric bodies (Earth, Mars) reflect mixing of bodies of variable volatile depletion, overprinted by volatile-undepleted material. From the Cr- and Ti isotopes in the BSE, such undepleted matter has been proposed to be CI chondrites. 6% CI added late to an enstatite chondrite-like proto-Earth would match the Earth. However, because Earth is an end-member in isotopic anomalies of heavier elements, no combination of existing meteorites alone can account for its chemical- and isotopic composition. Instead, the Earth is made partially or essentially entirely from an NC-like missing component. If so, the oxidised-, yet volatile-poor nature of inner solar system bodies, including Earth and Mars, is intrinsic to the NC reservoir.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based High-Precision Identification of Weak Stability Boundary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak stability boundary structures have been widely applied to the analysis on ballistic capture and the construction of low-energy transfers. The first step of this application is to compute/identify weak stability boundary structures. Conventional numerical and analytical methods cannot simultaneously achieve computational efficiency and identification precision. In this paper, we propose an efficient and precise method to identify weak stability boundary structures based on deep neural network. The geometric and dynamical properties of weak stability boundary structures are firstly analyzed, which provides further insights into the training of the deep neural network models. Then, the optimal hyperparameter combinations are determined by examining the identification precision of the trained deep neural network models. The performance of the models with the optimal hyperparameter combinations is further validated using the representative test datasets, achieving the precision of 97.26-99.91%. The trained models are also applied to constructing weak stability boundary structures.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Ices as Carriers of Supernova Material to the Early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary materials show systematic variations in their nucleosynthetic isotope compositions that resonate with orbital distance. The origin of this pattern remains debated, limiting how these isotopic signatures can be used to trace the precursors of terrestrial planets. Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion.</description>

      <title>Rotational Light-Curve Recovery &amp; Predictions of the LSST Yield of Hildas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilda population occupies the stable 3:2 mean-motion resonance of Jupiter and provides a window into Solar System evolution, including collisional processes. The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a simulation of Rubin's discovery of Hildas with the Sorcha (Merritt et al. 2025; Holman et al. 2025) survey simulator and the recovery of their light curves. We constructed a synthetic Hilda population model which includes distributions of orbital properties, sizes, collisional families and colors. We included two color classes corresponding to the Jupiter Trojan populations (Wong &amp; Brown 2017). We applied three distinct populations of sinusoidal light-curves to this same orbit-size-color model: (1) a Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) fit to rotational periods and amplitudes from the Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al. 2009) (2) a super-fast rotator (SFR) population (0-3 hours) and (3) a super-slow rotator (SSR) population (100-1400 hours). Over the ten-year simulated survey, we predict LSST will discover ~33,400 Hildas, a fivefold increase over the known population. Using a multiband Lomb-Scargle Periodogram via Astropy (Price-Whelan et al. 2022) we confidently recover ~46.5% of Hildas in our LCDB-based population, higher than typical in observational searches. This suggests our light-curve population model may differ from the intrinsic population. We find strong biases in light-curve amplitude, with recovery efficiency dropping sharply below 0.1 magnitudes, while biases from rotational period are comparatively weak aside from cadence-related features such as LSST's ~36 minute revisit cadence. ...</description>

      <title>A First Order Filter for the Detection of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for potentially habitable exoplanets is a primary objective in modern astrophysics, yet the vast number of candidates discovered by missions like Kepler and TESS presents a significant challenge for detailed follow-up characterization. An efficient and reliable method for prioritizing the most promising targets is therefore essential. In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class. We establish a tiered framework of ideal ratios, beginning with $\approx 108$ for G-type stars (anchored by the Earth-Sun system), and decreasing by a factor of two for K-type ($\approx 54$) and M-type ($\approx 27$) stars, respectively. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation, showing that exoplanets whose $d/D_s$ ratios are close to these empirically derived values consistently exhibit high Earth Similarity Index (ESI) scores. We propose that these tiered ratios represent "Habitability Main Sequences," analogous to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stars, providing a valuable and straightforward tool for the astronomical community to rapidly screen large datasets and efficiently shortlist high-priority candidates for further investigation with next-generation observatories.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Discovery: Validating TESS Candidates and Identifying Planets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-precision photometry from NASA's Kepler and TESS missions has revolutionized exoplanet detection, enabling the discovery of over 5500 confirmed exoplanets via the transit method and around 10000 additional candidates awaiting validation. However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor. Our modular design enables direct adaptation to future photometric missions like PLATO or Earth 2.0.</description>

      <title>Disintegration of Long-period Comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). II. Post-Perihelion Remnant Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the fate of disrupting near-Sun comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). Imaging observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), obtained 3--5 months after the reported disruption and the last sighting, constrained the primary component C/2019 Y4-B to an absolute magnitude of $H&gt;20.5$ or a diameter of $D&lt;0.5$~km (assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04) at an outbound heliocentric distance of 2.71~au. A search of shallower data obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, conducted when components A and B receded from 2.5 to 2.9~au from the Sun, yielded no detections, suggesting that the fragments had either ceased to exist or were not substantially active during this period. The uncertain fate of C/2019 Y4 highlights the challenge in understanding the state of presumably disrupted comets. Our review of six other presumably disrupted long-period comets reveals that negative confirmations were not reported for half of them, leaving their disruption presumptions inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</description>

      <title>The chemical diversity of giant-planet nurseries as revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the giant exoplanet occurrence rate peaking around stars of 1.5-2 solar masses, there is strong motivation to characterize the disks that set their formation conditions. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O&gt;1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O&lt;1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks.</description>

      <title>Inferring planet occurrence rates from radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to infer the posterior distribution for planet occurrence rates from radial-velocity (RV) observations. The approach combines posterior samples from the analysis of individual RV datasets of several stars, using importance sampling to reweight them appropriately. This eliminates the need for injection-recovery tests to compute detection limits and avoids the explicit definition of a detection threshold. We validate the method on simulated RV datasets and show that it yields unbiased estimates of the occurrence rate in different regions, with increasing precision as more stars are included in the analysis.</description>

      <title>A window for water-hydrogen demixing on warm metal-rich sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes represent the largest exoplanet demographic, yet their bulk compositions remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\sim 100$ to $700\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes.</description>

      <title>Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOTEM) Survey.VII. TOI-6041: a multi-planet system including a warm Neptune exhibiting strong TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the characterization of the TOI-6041 system, a bright ($V = 9.84 \pm 0.03$) G7-type star hosting at least two planets. The inner planet, TOI-6041b, is a warm Neptune with a radius of $4.55^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\,R_\oplus$, initially identified as a single-transit event in \textit{TESS} photometry. Subsequent observations with \textit{TESS} and \textit{CHEOPS} revealed additional transits, enabling the determination of its $26.04945^{+0.00033}_{-0.00034}$~d orbital period and the detection of significant transit timing variations (TTVs), exhibiting a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 1~hour. Radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the APF spectrographs allow us to place a $3\sigma$ upper mass limit of $28.9\,M_\oplus$ on TOI-6041b. In addition, the RV data reveal a second companion, TOI-6041c, on an 88~d orbit, with a minimum mass of $0.25\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. A preliminary TTV analysis suggests that the observed variations could be caused by gravitational perturbations from planet c; however, reproducing the observed amplitudes requires a relatively high eccentricity of about 0.3 for planet c. Our dynamical stability analysis indicates that such a configuration is dynamically viable and places a $1\sigma$ upper limit on the mass of TOI-6041c at $0.8\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. An alternative is the presence of a third, low-mass planet located between planets b and c, or on an inner orbit relative to planet b -- particularly near a mean-motion resonance with planet b -- which could account for the observed variations. These findings remain tentative, and further RV and photometric observations are essential to better constrain the mass of planet b and to refine the TTV modeling, thereby improving our understanding of the system's dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>The Astrometric Resoeccentric Degeneracy: Eccentric Single Planets Mimic 2:1 Resonant Planet Pairs in Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\mathrm{eff} = \, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Research Note we present new gravity-darkening exponents ($\beta$) for several stellar evolution models from the ZAMS up to the giant phase. The models were computed using the MESA code (version 7385) for the composition $X = 0.70$ and $Z = 0.02$, adopting A09 opacities and a mixing length parameter of $\alpha_{\rm MLT} = 1.84$. Results were calculated using the triangle strategy, for initial stellar masses of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 $M_{\odot}$, and provide an update on previously available $\beta$ values that used older models.</description>

      <title>A tale of three tails: A misaligned streamer and mysterious structures around [BHB2007]1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of streamer-like structures around protostellar sources challenge the traditional picture of isolated, axisymmetric star formation. Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Angular-Differential Post-Processing Algorithms for Exoplanet Direct Detection with a Photonic Lantern Nuller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet research is essential for understanding planetary formation and the potential for life beyond our solar system. The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the ESA Comet Interceptor mission, which is due to launch in 2028/29 to a yet-to-be-discovered target, can provide a conceptual basis for a future mission to visit an Interstellar Object. Comet Interceptor will wait in space until a suitable long period comet is discovered, allowing rapid response to perform a fast flyby of an object that will be in the inner Solar System for only a few years; an enhanced version of this concept could realistically provide the first in situ investigation of a visitor from another star system.</description>

      <title>Kratos-polrad: Novel GPU system for Monte-Carlo simulations with consistent polarization calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized radiation serves as a vital diagnostic tool in astrophysics, providing unique insights into magnetic field geometries, scattering processes, and three-dimensional structures in diverse astrophysical scenarios. To address these applications, we present Kratos-polrad, a novel GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code built upon the heterogeneous computing framework of Kratos, designed for self-consistent and efficient polarization calculations. It utlizes comprehensive treatment of Stokes parameters throughout photon propagation, featuring transforms the grain-lab frame transforms using quaternion algebra and consistent non-linear polarization extinction in cells, which are useful in modeling radiative transfer processes with scatterings by aligned dust grains. The code implements two-step polarimetry imaging that decouples Monte Carlo sampling of scattering physics from imaging geometry, enabling efficient synthesis maximizing the utilization of photon packets. Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations. By leveraging massive GPU parallelism, optimized memory access patterns, and analytical approaches for optically thick cells, Kratos-polrad achieves performance improvements of $\sim 10^{2}$ times compared to CPU-based methods, enabling previously prohibitive studies in polarimetric astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection limits in the SHINE F150 survey through the Regime Switching Model Optimizing thresholds and investigating environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-contrast imaging, a novel detection algorithm for angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences has recently been introduced: the Regime Switching Model (RSM). In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.</description>

      <title>Nested Sampling for ARIMA Model Selection in Astronomical Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming era of large scale, high cadence astronomical surveys demands efficient and robust methods for time series analysis. ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Radiometric sensitivity and resolution of synthetic tracking imaging for orbital debris monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sampling and detection strategies for solar illuminated space debris. We argue that the lowest detectable debris cross section may be reduced by 10-100x by analysis of stacks of image frames collected at high rates rather than single frame data. In particular, instead of a pixel as a spatial region, the analysis is based on a "phase-space-pixel" which corresponds to an angular velocity and space region and whose intensity is computed by a weighted stacking of spatial pixels corresponding to a test debris trajectory within a wide camera field-of-view (FOV). To isolate debris signals from background, the exposure time is set to match the time it takes a debris to transit through the instantaneous field of view. Debris signatures are detected by multiscale X-ray processing of the data cube. Radiometric analysis of line integrals shows that sub-cm objects in Low Earth Orbit can be detected and assigned full orbital parameters by this approach.</description>

      <title>WASP-39b: exo-Saturn with patchy cloud composition, moderate metallicity, and underdepleted S/O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios.
  In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (&gt; 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.</description>

      <title>SPORES-HWO. II. Companion Mass Limits and Updated Planet Properties for 120 Future Exoplanet Imaging Targets from 35 yr of Precise Doppler Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10679</link>

Abstract: A goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize true Earth-analogs. However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown dynamically disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be surveyed, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle. Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first observations going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 $\rm M_\oplus$. We also provide updated parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect at least 26 additional RV signals corresponding to stellar activity and 4 signals that are planet candidates. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.</description>

      <title>Modeling Atmospheric Ion Escape from Kepler-1649 b and c over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets for atmospheric characterization, yet their long-term evolution under intense stellar winds and high-energy radiation remains poorly constrained. The Kepler-1649 system, hosting two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, provides a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric evolution in the extreme environments typical of M-dwarf systems. In this Letter we show that both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales. Using a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion escape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.8 to 4.0 Gyr. The results reveal a clear decline in total ion escape rates with stellar age, as captured by a nonparametric LOWESS regression, with O$^{+}$ comprising 98.3%-99.9% of the total loss. Escape rates at 4.0 Gyr are two to three orders of magnitude lower than during early epochs. At 0.8 Gyr, planet b exhibits 3.79$\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c, whereas by 4.0 Gyr its O$^{+}$ escape rate becomes 39.5$\times$ lower. This reversal arises from a transition to sub-magnetosonic star-planet interactions, where the fast magnetosonic Mach number, $M_f$, falls below unity. Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion, both planets may have retained significant atmospheres, suggesting potential long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into atmospheric retention in the Kepler-1649 system and inform future JWST observations of similar M-dwarf terrestrial exoplanets aimed at refining habitability assessments.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Parameter R$_{\rho}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the parameter $R_{\rho}$, which allows one to explore in an approximate way the efficiency of semiconvection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.</description>

      <title>A Cold and Super-Puffy Planet on a Prograde Orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $&lt;$ 0.2 g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day prograde orbit around a 700 Myr old F star. The transits were detected using data from TESS as well as the Antarctic telescope ASTEP. A joint analysis of the light curves and radial velocities from HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE confirmed the planetary nature of the signal by limiting the mass to be below 20 $M_\oplus$ at 95% confidence. The radial velocities also exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and imply that the planet orbits the star in a prograde orbit with a sky-projected obliquity $\lambda=-9_{-49}^{+53}$ deg ($|\lambda|&lt;80$ deg at $3\sigma$). With these characteristics, TOI-4507 is one of the longest-period systems for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and the planet is among the longest-period and youngest ''super-puff'' planets yet discovered.</description>

      <title>Sub-Snowline Formation of Gas-Giant Planets in Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 17 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates an inner dust trap. After removing evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars) and higher-order systems, we find that gas giants position is a linear function of the truncation radius. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, evolved systems are generally inconsistent with the predictions, which further supports the model and points to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.</description>
