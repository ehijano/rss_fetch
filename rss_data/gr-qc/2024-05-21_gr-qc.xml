      <title>Short-range tests of the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tested the equivalence principle at short length scales by rotating a 3-ton $^{238}$U attractor around a compact torsion balance containing Cu and Pb test bodies. The observed differential acceleration of the test bodies toward the attractor, $a_{\text{Cu}}-a_{\text{Pb}} =(1.0\pm2.8)\times 10^{-13}$ cm/s$^2$, should be compared to the corresponding gravitational acceleration of $9.2\times10^{-5}$ cm/s$^2$. Our results set new constraints on equivalence-principle violating interactions with Yukawa ranges down to 1 cm, and improve by substantial factors existing limits for ranges between 10 km and 1000 km. Our data also set strong constraints on certain power law potentials that can arise from two-boson exchange processes.</description>

      <title>$C^3$ matching conditions for anisotropic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $C^3$ approach is an invariant formalism that utilizes the eigenvalues of the Riemann curvature tensor to match spacetimes across a specific matching surface. We apply this approach to match an anisotropic fluid with an exterior vacuum solution, including the case in which discontinuities appear on the matching surface. As a particular example, a class of analytic solutions, which describe the gravitational field of realistic neutron stars, is matched to the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Radiative Degrees of Freedom of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric action of the semi-direct product of the Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras contains the WZW action equipped with a background vector potential $A$ associated to a coadjoint element of the Kac-Moody algebra as well as the 2D gravitational Polyakov action and an accompanying background field, $\mathcal{D}$, called the diffeomorphism field. Just as the coadjoint element, $A$, is related to a gauge fixed Yang-Mills vector potential $A_a$, the diffeomorphism field, $\mathcal{D}$, is related to a component, $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ of the projectively invariant connection called the Thomas Operator. The Yang-Mills action provides dynamics for the vector potential $A_a,$ while the Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravitational action, provides dynamics to $\mathcal{D}_{ab}$. The TW action embeds the projectively invariant connection into a gravitational theory that contains general relativity. In this work, the diffeomorphism field $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ is examined in Minkowski space where salient features of this field can be explored. In particular, we study the radiative degrees of freedom of this field while in a Minkowski space background. We show that it can be decomposed into irreducible representations, corresponding to tensor, vector, and scalar radiating solutions. Furthermore we examine geodesic deviation in the context of TW gravity about a Minkowski space background. We do this both at zeroth and first order in metric fluctuations $h_{ab}$. We discuss that response of a gravitational wave antennae to the geodesics deviations.</description>

      <title>On the choice of variable for quantization of conformal GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of using spin connection components as basic quantization variables of a conformal version of General Relativity is studied. The considered model contains gravitational degrees of freedom and a scalar dilaton field. The standard tetrad formalism is applied. Properties of spin connections in this model are analyzed. Secondary quantization of the chosen variables is performed. The gravitational part of the model action turns out to be quadratic with respect to the spin connections. So at the quantum level the model looks trivial, i.e., without quantum self-interactions. Meanwhile the correspondence to General Relativity is preserved at the classical level.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Higher Harmonics On Gravitational Wave Dark Sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from the merger of two black holes can serve as a standard sirens for cosmological inference. However, a degeneracy exists between the luminosity distance and the inclination angle between the binary system's orbital angular momentum and the observer's line of sight, limiting the precise measurement of the luminosity distance. In this study, we investigate how higher harmonics affect luminosity distance estimation for third-generation (3G) GW detectors in binary black hole mergers. Our findings demonstrate that considering higher harmonics significantly enhances distance inference results compared with using only the (2,2) mode. This improved accuracy in distance estimates also strengthens constraints on host galaxies, enabling more precise measurements of the Hubble constant. These results highlight the significant influence of higher harmonics on the range estimation accuracy of 3G ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement production through a cosmological bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for generic initial data, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy levels for Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates and we use the tetrads formalism. Solving a second-order differential equation for the two components of the Dirac spinor, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, and the relativistic energy levels of the fermion and antifermion, where such levels are quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the two components of the spinor), curvature and rotation parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (describes the conical curvature and the angular momentum of the spinning cosmic string), and on the vorticity parameter $\Omega$ (describes the G\"odel-type spacetime). In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of $\Omega$ (i.e., $\Omega$ acts as a kind of ``external field or potential''). We see that for $m_j&gt;0$, the energy levels do not depend on $s$ and $u$; however, depend on $n$, $m_j$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$. In this case, $\alpha$ breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels and such levels can increase infinitely in the limit $\frac{4\Omega\beta}{\alpha}\to 1$. Already for $m_j&lt;0$, we see that the energy levels depends on $s$, $u$ and $n$; however, it no longer depends on $m_j$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In this case, it is as if the fermion ``lives only in a flat G\"odel-type spacetime''. Besides, we also study the low-energy or nonrelativistic limit of the system. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of energy levels as a function of $\Omega$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Jeans analysis in fractional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been demonstrated [A. Giusti, Phys. Rev. D 101, 124029 (2020)] that characteristic traits of Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can be replicated from an entirely distinct framework: a fractional variant of Newtonian mechanics. To further assess its validity, this proposal needs to be tested in relevant astrophysical scenarios. Here, we investigate its implications on Jeans gravitational instability and related phenomena. We examine scenarios involving classical matter confined by gravity and extend our analysis to the quantum domain, through a Schr\"odinger-Newton approach. We also derive a generalized Lane-Emden equation associated with fractional gravity. Through comparisons between the derived stability criteria and the observed stability of Bok globules, we establish constraints on the theory's parameters to align with observational data.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Kerr Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection within the Plunging Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection within a highly magnetized plasma has been seen as a viable mechanism to extract the energy from a rotating black hole, as it can generate negative energy plasmoids in the ergoregion. For a typical accreting black hole, the ergoregion is filled with bulk plasma plunging from the innermost-stable-circular orbit (ISCO). In this study, we present an analytical study of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. In contrast to the toroidal plasma, where the magnetic field cannot be derived from the MHD scheme, the magnetic field in the plunging plasma was determined by the ideal-MHD condition. We derive the global magnetic field structure in a fast reconnection model, and we read the expressions for the energies of plasmoids ejected from the reconnection region, for general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Then, we demonstrate the behaviors of ejected energies varying with the reconnection locations in the Kerr spacetime, and identify the region where a negative-energy plasmoid can be produced. We find that for a certain magnetization there exists a critical value of the black hole spin, beyond which the energy extraction can occur, and the energy extraction is most efficient for the near-extreme black hole. Moreover, we study the conditions necessary for a plasmoid with positive energy to escape to the infinity, a crucial requirement for effective energy extractions. Considering the escaping conditions, we provide the parameter space in the radius-spin plane in which the energy extraction mechanism is effective.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by wormholes and its shadow due to dark matter within modified symmetric teleparallel gravity formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <title>Graviton-photon conversions in Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversions in an environment of the uniform and constant magnetic field considering Euler-K\"ockel-Heisenberg-type nonlinear corrections in electrodynamics. We take the transverse-tracefree gauge for gravitons and employ both the field potential and the electric and magnetic (EM) fields for photons. The nonlinear correction causes parity violating (chiral) graviton propagation equations, which depend on the two treatments for photons. Thus, the medium becomes effectively birefringent for two polarizations of gravitational waves similar to the photon birefringence a characteristic of the nonlinear correction. In the presence of gravity, due to the nontrivial relation between the potential and EM fields, it is important to present the result using the EM fields.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Tangent Spaces on Causal Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand on previous work describing partial derivatives and metric component estimators to define tangent spaces on causal sets. Partial derivative operators are the basis vectors of the tangent space, and the metric defines the inner product. First, we use partial derivatives of the metric components to define the connection and partial derivatives of the connection to define the curvature. Numerical results show that both of these approach the expected values for a flat spacetime as density increases. Then we used the connection to define parallel transport and geodesics.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Micro-cosmos model of a nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the age-old quest to construct a geometric model of a quantum particle. While static classical particle models have largely been dismissed, the focus has now shifted to intricate dynamic models that hold the promise of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. We propose that matter particles can be described as radiation confined within dynamically curved spacetime regions, without the need for quantization of space and time, and using standard field equations and natural Planck units. Specifically, we investigate a cyclic or oscillating radiation-dominated micro cosmos undergoing repeated bouncing. Our methodology employs integration, with carefully defined initial conditions. The results include several observable properties characteristic of quantum particles. We calculate the total mass, revealing a compelling inverse proportionality between mass and radius identical with the de Broglie relationship. Applying this model to protons, we discover a profound and surprisingly simple relationship between the proton's radius and mass expressed in Planck units. This enables a definition of the proton radius that aligns remarkably well with the 2018 CODATA value. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the radial density profile of the proton (or nucleon), averaged over a cycle time, increases toward the center. The problem of embedding the micro cosmos within a background spacetime is also described. These results underscore the relevance of general relativity in the domain of nuclear physics. Moreover, the model offers a fresh perspective that can stimulate new ideas in the ongoing quest to unify general relativity with quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>Quazinormal modes and greybody factor of black hole surrounded by a quintessence in the S-V-T modified gravity as well as shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs), greybody factors (GFs) and shadows in a plasma of a black hole (BH) surrounded by an exotic fluid of quintessence type in a scalar-vector-tensor modified gravity. The effects of a quintessence scalar field and the modified gravity (MOG) field on the QNM, GF, and shadow are examined. Using the sixth-order WKB approach, we investigate the QNMs of massless scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Our findings show that as the quintessence and the MOG parameter ($\epsilon$ and $\alpha$) increase, the oscillation frequencies decrease significantly. Gravitational wave damping, on the other hand, decreases with increasing $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$. In addition, we obtain an analytical solution for the transmission coefficients (GF) and demonstrate that more thermal radiation reaches the observer at spatial infinity as both the $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ parameters increase. We also investigate the effect of the plasma background on the BH shadow and show that as the plasma background parameter increases, the shadow radius slightly shrinks. Nevertheless, the shadow radius increases as $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$ increase. Particularly intriguing is the fact that increasing $\epsilon$ has a greater impact on the shadow radius than increasing $\alpha$, indicating that the quintessence parameter has a greater impact than the MOG parameter.</description>

      <title>Cosserat elasticity as the weak-field limit of Einstein--Cartan relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak-field limit of Einstein--Cartan (EC) relativity is studied. The equations of EC theory are rewritten such that they formally resemble those of Einstein General Relativity (EGR); this allows ideas from post-Newtonian theory to be imported without essential change. The equations of motion are then written both at first post-Newtonian (1PN) order and at 1.5PN order. EC theory's 1PN equations of motion are found to be those of a micropolar/Cosserat elastic medium, along with a decoupled evolution equation for non-classical, spin-related fields. It seems that a necessary condition for these results to hold is that one chooses the non-classical fields to scale with the speed of light in a certain empirically reasonable way. Finally, the 1.5PN equations give greater insight into the coupling between energy-momentum and spin within slowly moving, weakly gravitating matter. Specifically, the weakly relativistic modifications to Cosserat theory involve a gravitational torque and an augmentation of the gravitational force due to a `dynamic mass moment density' with an accompanying `dynamic mass moment density flux', and new forms of linear momentum density captured by a `dynamic mass density flux' and a `dynamic momentum density'.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon properties of trajectories with finite force relevant for Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Banados-SIlk-West (BSW) effect, two particles moving towards a black hole, can collide near the horizon with an unbounded energy in the center of mass frame. This requires one of particles to have fine-tuned parameters in such a way that the time component of generalized momentum is zero $X=0$. Thus the existence of such trjectories is a necessary condition for the BSW effect. However, it is insufficient since the forward-in-time condition requires $X&gt;0$ outside the horizon. We examine this condition for different types of partricles and horizons and find configurations for which the BSW effect is possible. In doing so, we take into account a finite force of unspesified nature exerted on particles. It includes relationships between numbers characterizing the rate with which four-velocity, acceleration and metric functions change near the horizon. For some aforementioned relations, parameters of a system control the sign of $X$, in other cases they are required for $X$ to be real quantity. In the simplest case of free particles the BSW effect for the Kerr or Kerr-Newman black hole is impossible if a fine-tuned particle has a negative energy, so in this sense combination of the Penrose process and the BSW effect is forbidden.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>On The Perturbations of Gibbons-Maeda Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of perturbations around black hole backgrounds in general relativity and Einstein-Maxwell theory has a long history, going back to the work of Regge and Wheeler in the 1950s. As part of a broader investigation of perturbations around black holes in supergravity, we describe here our results for the perturbations around the Gibbons-Maeda static charged black holes in a class of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories. Our analysis follows the general strategy developed by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos for the perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Here, the analysis is considerably more involved, because of the presence of the dilaton field, which couples to the other polar modes. We nonetheless find that the problem is completely solvable, in the sense that one can separate variables and eventually describe all the perturbations in terms of diagonalised second-order radial equations. We are able to prove the mode stability of all the Gibbons-Maeda black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Detection and Prediction of Future Massive Black Hole Mergers with Machine Learning and Truncated Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning framework tailored to detect massive black hole binaries observed by spaceborne gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and predict their future merger times. The detection is performed via convolutional neural networks that analyze time-evolving Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) spectrograms and utilize variations in signal power to trigger alerts. The prediction of future merger times is accomplished with reinforcement learning. Here, the proposed algorithm dynamically refines time-to-merger predictions by assimilating new data as it becomes available. Deep Q-learning serves as the core technique of the approach, utilizing a neural network to estimate Q-values throughout the observational state space. To enhance robust learning in a noisy environment, we integrate an actor-critic mechanism that segregates action proposals from their evaluation, thus harnessing the advantages of policy-based and value-based learning paradigms. We leverage merger estimation obtained via template matching with truncated waveforms to generate rewards for the reinforcement learning agent. These estimations come with uncertainties, which magnify as the merger event stretches further into the future. The reinforcement learning setup is shown to adapt to these uncertainties by employing a policy fine-tuning approach, ensuring the reliability of predictions despite the varying degrees of template-matching precision. The algorithm denotes a first step toward a low-latency model that provides early warnings for impending transient phenomena. By delivering timely and accurate forecasts of merger events, the framework supports the coordination of gravitational wave observations with accompanied electromagnetic counterparts, thus enhancing the prospects of multi-messenger astronomy. We use the LISA Spritz data challenge for validation.</description>

      <title>Study of relativistic hot accretion flow around Kerr-like Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of relativistic, low-angular momentum, inviscid advective accretion flow in a stationary axisymmetric Kerr-like wormhole (WH) spacetime, characterized by the spin parameter ($a_{\rm k}$), the dimensionless parameter ($\beta$), and the source mass ($M_{\rm WH}$). In doing so, we self-consistently solve the set of governing equations describing the relativistic accretion flow around a Kerr-like WH in the steady state, and for the first time, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions for transonic as well as subsonic flows. We study the properties of dynamical and thermodynamical flow variables and examine how the nature of the accretion solutions alters due to the change of the model parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), $a_{\rm k}$, and $\beta$. Further, we separate the parameter space in $\lambda-\mathcal{E}$ plane according to the nature of the flow solutions, and study the modification of the parameter space by varying $a_{\rm k}$ and $\beta$. Moreover, we retrace the parameter space in $a_{\rm k}-\beta$ plane that allows accretion solutions containing multiple critical points. Finally, we calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) considering free-free emissions for transonic solutions as these solutions are astrophysically relevant and discuss the implication of this model formalism in the context of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Testing spatial curvature in an anisotropic extension of $w$CDM model with low redshift data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the observational constraints on a Bianchi type I anisotropic extension of $w$CDM model with spatial curvature from observational data including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic chronometers (CC), Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), Pantheon+ (PP) compilation of SNe Ia and SH0ES Cepheid host distance anchors. The anisotropy is found to be of the order $10^{-13}$, which interplay with spatial curvature to reduce $H_0$ tension by $\sim 1\sigma$ as found in the analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data, while no significant effect of anisotropy is observed with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data. A closed Universe is favored by $w$CDM as well as anisotropic $w$CDM models with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data. An observation of an open Universe from $w$CDM model with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data and a closed Universe from anisotropic $w$CDM model with curvature in analyses with same combination of data is made. The quintessence form of dark energy is favored at 95\% CL in both analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to $1$)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <title>On non-detection of Gamma-Ray Bursts in three compact binary merger events detected by LIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and the short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB) event GRB 170817A, marked the beginning of GW multi-messenger astronomy and confirmed that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of at least some SGRBs. An estimated joint detection rate of 0.3 - 1.7 per year between the LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston and Virgo GW network at design sensitivity, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor was predicted. However, to date, the GW170817/GRB 170817A joint detection has been the only event of its kind so far. Taking into account that SGRBs are narrowly beamed and are emitted perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, we propose that previous mergers involving neutron stars, were orientated such that observation of the emitted SGRB along this narrow jet was not possible. To support this hypothesis we have estimated the inclination of the binary systems for previously detected Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Black Hole Neutron Star (BHNS) mergers through GW analysis. This analysis was performed using BILBY, a Python based Bayesian inference library, to estimate the inclination of the BNS events GW170817 and GW190425, and the BHNS events GW190917_114630 and GW200115_042309. The results obtained in this study indicate that these binaries may have had inclinations greater than $33^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight from Earth, an upper limit on the viewing angle set from observations of GRB 170817A. This then suggests that the observation of the emitted SGRB from these past mergers might not have been possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive evidence of a nano-hertz gravitational wave background recently found by several pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations opened up a window to test modified gravity theories in a unique frequency band in parallel to other gravitational wave detection experiments. In particular, the overlap reduction function (ORF) in PTA observation is sensitive to the phase velocity of gravitational waves. In this work, we provide analytical expressions for the coefficients of the multipole moments in the ORF, and utilize these analytical results to study constraints on the phase velocity from the frequency dependent overlap reduction function obtained from the Chinese PTA (CPTA) data. While the data contain large error bars yet, interesting constraints are found in the frequency-dependent ORF in the case of subluminal phase velocity. This makes us expect that the nano-hertz band gravitational wave background will become one of the important arenas for exploring modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Graviton physics: Quantum field theory of gravitons, graviton noise and gravitational decoherence -- a concise tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy capable of probing into the strong field dynamics of black holes and neutron stars. It has opened up an exciting new window for laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity. In recent years there are two interesting proposals aimed at revealing the quantum natures of perturbative gravity: 1) theoretical predictions in how graviton noise from the early universe after the vacuum of the gravitational field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; 2) experimental proposals using the quantum entanglement between two masses each in a superposition state. The first proposal invokes the stochastic properties of quantum fields, the second invokes a key concept of quantum information. An equally basic and interesting idea is to ask whether and how gravity might be responsible for a quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity is universal. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena. To fully appreciate these exciting developments requires a working knowledge in classical GR, QF theory and QI plus some familiarity with stochastic processes, namely, noise in quantum fields. Traditionally a new researcher may be conversant in one or two of these four subjects: GR, QFT, QI, SP, depending on his/her background. This tutorial attempts to provide the necessary connections between them, helping an engaging reader from any one of these four subjects to leapfrog to the frontier of these interdisciplinary research topics. Here we shall treat the three topics listed in the title, save gravitational entanglement, because its nature and implications proclaimed in relation to quantum gravity still contain many controversial elements.</description>

Abstract: We study the linearized gravity theory in the Newman-Unti gauge in the near horizon region of the de Sitter spacetime. The linearized Einstein equation involves the cosmological constant. The near horizon symmetry consists of near horizon supertranslation and near horizon superrotation. We compute the near horizon supertranslation charge and find the proper near horizon fall-off conditions which uncover a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon supertranslation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group Perspective on Gravitational Critical Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a new class of gravitational collapses. The conjecture is made by observing the Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours of perturbations of an extremal black hole spacetime and compare them to similar properties of Choptuik-type critical solutions. By performing analytical perturbation studies on extremal black holes, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as renormalization group (RG) limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. We identify various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters, which are observed in gravitational critical collapses. We also discuss a version of gravitational Efimov effect.</description>

      <title>Noether Charge, Thermodynamics and Phase Transition of a Black Hole in the Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter-Beltrami spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate thermodynamic properties and Hawking-Page phase transition of a black hole in the Schwarzschil-Anti-de Sitter-Beltrami (SAdSB) spacetime. We discuss the Beltrami or inertial coordinates of the Anti-de Sitter(AdS) spacetime. Transformation between the non-inertial and inertial coordinates of the AdS spacetime is formulated to construct the solution of spherical gravitating mass and other physical quantities. The Killing vector is determined to calculate the event horizon radius of this black hole. The entropy and the temperature of SAdSB black hole are determined by the Noether charge method and it is shown that the temperature is bounded by the Anti-de Sitter radius. Similarly, the Smarr relation and first law of black hole thermodynamics for the SAdSB spacetime have been formulated. The Gibbs free energy and heat capacity of this black hole are calculated and we consider the phase transition between small and large black holes. The first-order phase transition between the thermal AdS spacetime and large black hole phase is also investigated and the Hawking-Page temperature is computed and compared with the case of the Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter(SAdS) black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is expected to introduce quantum aspects into the description of reference frames. Here we set the stage for exploring how quantum gravity induced deformations of classical symmetries could modify the transformation laws among reference frames in an effective regime. We invoke the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ as a description of deformed spatial rotations and interpret states of a representation of its algebra as describing the relative orientation between two reference frames. This leads to a quantization of one of the Euler angles and to the new paradigm of agency-dependence: space is reconstructed as a collection of fuzzy points, exclusive to each agent, which depends on their choice of reference frame. Each agent can choose only one direction in which points can be sharp, while points in all other directions become fuzzy in a way that depends on this choice. Two agents making different choices will thus observe the same points with different degrees of fuzziness.</description>

      <title>Infinitely degenerate slowly rotating solutions in $f(R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work tests the no-hair conjecture in $f(R)$ gravity models. No-hair conjecture asserts that all black holes in General Relativity coupled to any matter must be Kerr-Newman type. However, the conjecture fails in some cases with non-linear matter sources. Here, we address this by explicitly constructing multiple slow-rotating black hole solutions, up to second order in rotational parameter, for a class of $f(R)$ models ( $f(R) =(\alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}\,R)^{p}, p &gt; 1$). Such an $f(R)$ includes all higher-powers of $R$. We analytically show that multiple vacuum solutions satisfy the field equations up to the second order in the rotational parameter. In other words, we show that the multiple vacuum solutions depend on arbitrary constants, which depend on the coupling parameters of the model. Hence, our results indicate that the no-hair theorem for modified gravity theories merits extending to include the coupling constants. The uniqueness of our result stems from the fact that these are obtained directly from metric formalism without conformal transformation. We discuss the kinematical properties of these black hole solutions and compare them with slow-rotating Kerr. Specifically, we show that the circular orbits for the black holes in $f(R)$ are smaller than that of Kerr. This implies that the inner-most stable circular orbit for black holes in $f(R)$ is smaller than Kerr's; hence, the shadow radius might also be smaller. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future observations.</description>

      <title>Galactic wormholes: Geometry, stability, and echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the environmental effects on wormholes residing in a galaxy. By this, we propose that these wormholes are mimickers of supermassive black holes residing at the galactic centers. In particular, we consider two wormhole spacetimes classes: the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole and the braneworld wormhole. While there is no classical matter model for the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole, the braneworld wormhole, on the other hand, is supported by a scalar-tensor theory on the four-dimensional brane. Intriguingly, it turns out that the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding these wormholes can tame the violations of energy conditions present in generic wormhole spacetimes. Our results also demonstrate that the galactic Damour-Solodukhin wormhole is more stable than its isolated counterpart under linear scalar perturbation, whereas we obtain the opposite behavior for the braneworld wormhole. The perturbation of these wormholes leads to echoes in the ringdown waveform, which are sensitive to the properties of the dark matter halo. To be precise, the time delay between two echoes is affected by the galactic matter environment, and it appears to be a generic effect present for any exotic compact object living in a galaxy. This allows us to identify the galactic parameters, independently from the gravitational wave measurements, if echoes are observed in future generations of gravitational wave detectors. For completeness, we have also analyzed the impact of the galactic environment on the photon sphere, the innermost stable circular orbits, and the shadow radius. It turns out that the dark matter halo indeed affects these locations, with implications for shadow and accretion physics.</description>

      <title>Preliminary analyses on dynamics and thermodynamics of rotating regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic and thermodynamic laws governing rotating regular black holes. By analyzing dynamic properties, i.e., the interaction between scalar particles and rotating regular black holes, we establish the criteria that determine whether such black holes satisfy the laws of thermodynamics or not. In addition, we provide the general form of conserved quantities related to rotating regular black holes, including the relevant flows associated with neutral scalar particles. Meanwhile, we reexamine the relationship between the third law of thermodynamics and weak cosmic censorship conjecture for rotating regular black holes. In accordance with the criteria mentioned above, we discuss the laws of thermodynamics for three models of rotating regular black holes: Rotating Hayward black holes, Kerr black-bounce solutions, and loop quantum gravity black holes. Our findings indicate that none of the three models satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. In particular, the first and third models fail to comply with the three laws of thermodynamics, while the second model satisfies only the second and third laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we attempt to rescue the laws of thermodynamics by modifying entropy or extending phase space. However, the two scenarios are not able to ensure the three laws of thermodynamics in the three models, which reveals an unusual property of rotating regular black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experiment involving the entanglement of two massive particles through gravitational fields has been devised to discern the quantum attributes of gravity. In this paper, we present a scheme to extend this experiment's applicability to more generalized curved spacetimes, with the objective of validating universal quantum gravity within broader contexts. Specifically, we direct our attention towards the quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in astrophysical phenomena, such as particles traversing the interstellar medium. Notably, we ascertain that the gravitational field within curved spacetime can induce observable entanglement between particle pairs in both scenarios, even when dealing with particles significantly smaller than mesoscopic masses. Furthermore, we obtain the characteristic spectra of QGEM across diverse scenarios, shedding light on potential future experimental examinations. This approach not only establishes a more pronounced and extensive manifestation of the quantum influences of gravity compared to the original scheme but also opens avenues for prospective astronomical experiments. These experiments, aligned with our postulates, hold immense advantages and implications for the detection of quantum gravity and can be envisioned for future design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we will first-time model galactic black holes in pure Lovelock gravity. Even though working with higher spacetime dimensions, we assume (implicitly) the Hernquist-type mass profile for the galaxy in such a way that the horizon structure of a pure LoveLock black hole remains intact. In this way, we will model the galactic pure Lovelock black hole with arbitrary dimension ($d$) and order ($N$). Then, we will specialize this technique for critical dimension $d=3N+1$. We want to see how the galactic parameters affect the time domain single, quasinormal modes, photon sphere, innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), and shadow radius. The time domain signal may allow us to identify the galactic parameters as well as to distinguish them from their isolated pure Lovelock counterparts if it is observed in future generations of gravitational wave measurements. We also calculate Hawking temperature for the same setup and want to see how Hawking's temperature will be affected due to the presence of a galaxy. It shows that the presence of a galactic halo can quench Hawking temperature.</description>

Abstract: In our previous work, we have explored quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in curved spacetime, observing entanglement formation between particles moving along geodesics in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that long interaction time induces entanglement, even for particles with microscopic mass, addressing decoherence concerns. In this work, we build upon our previous work by extending our investigation to a time-dependent spacetime. Specifically, we explore the entanglement induced by the mutual gravitation of massive particles in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) universe. Through calculations of the phase variation and the QGEM spectrum, our proposed scheme offers a potential method for observing the formation of entanglement caused by the quantum gravity of massive particles as they propagate in the FLRW universe. Consequently, our research provides fresh insights into the field of entanglement in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mixed scalarization of charged black holes: from spontaneous to non-linear scalarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalarized black holes (BH) have been shown to form dynamically in extended-scalar-tensor theories, either through spontaneous scalarization -- when the BH is unstable against linear perturbations -- or through a non-linear scalarization. In the latter, linearly stable BHs can ignite scalarization when sufficiently perturbed. These phenomena are, however, not incompatible and mixed scalarization is also possible. We explore two aspects of the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar model: solutions containing, simultaneously, linear (\textit{aka} standard) and non-linear scalarization; and the effects of having one of the coupling constants with an 'opposite sign' to the one leading to scalarization. Both points are addressed by constructing and examining the mixed scalarization's domain of existence. An overall dominance of the spontaneous scalarization over the non-linear scalarization is observed. Thermodynamically, an entropical preference for mixed over the standard scalarization (spontaneous or non-linear) exists. In the presence of counter scalarization, a quench of the scalarization occurs, mimicking the effect of a scalar particle's mass/positive self-interaction term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum black holes (BHs), thought of as an excited multilevel system, can be effectively modelled by replacing an event horizon with a partially reflective membrane. This emergent feature affects their interaction with hosting environments, with the most pronounced effects happening for environments of particles with mass~$m_{\rm p}\lesssim (10 M_{\odot}/M)\,10^{-11}\mathrm{\,eV/c^2}$, with~$M$ the BH mass. We show that ultra-light bosons -- a viable dark matter candidate -- can be used to probe the quantum nature of BHs. We derive analytical expressions for the accretion rate and dynamical friction acting on exotic compact objects moving through an ultra-light scalar field, which we then use to estimate the orbital de-phasing in the inspiralling of different Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna (LISA) binaries. Our results indicate that LISA may be able to discriminate quantum from classical BHs.</description>

Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that one can construct invertible conformal transformations with a parity-violating conformal factor, which can be employed to generate a novel class of parity-violating ghost-free metric theories from general relativity. We obtain exact solutions for rotating black holes in such theories by performing the conformal transformation on the Kerr solution in general relativity, which we dub conformal Kerr solutions. We explore the geodesic motion of a test particle in the conformal Kerr spacetime. While null geodesics remain the same as those in the Kerr spacetime, timelike geodesics exhibit interesting differences due to an effective external force caused by the parity-violating conformal factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the leptogenesis mechanisms, which are associated with B-L symmetry breaking mechanism has notable effects on the production of gravitational waves. These gravitational waves align well with the recent observations of a stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav and pulsar-timing arrays (PTAs). For these gravitational waves to match the recent measurements, the critical value of the B-L breaking should be around the GUT scale. Moreover, we consider the generation of primordial gravitational waves from binary systems of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) which could be predicted by the recent detection of gravitational waves. PBHs with specific masses can be responsible for massive galaxy formation observed at high redshifts reported by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We contemplate the potential for a shared source between the NANOGrav and JWST observations, namely primordial black holes. These black holes could serve as seeds of rapid galaxy formation, offering an explanation for the galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore quantum corrections of electrically charged black holes subject to vacuum polarization effects of fermion fields in QED. Solving this problem exactly is challenging so we restrict to perturbative corrections that one can obtain using the heat kernel expansion in the one-loop effective action for electrons. Starting from the corrections originally computed by Drummond and Hathrell, we solve the full semiclassical Einstein-Maxwell system of coupled equations to leading order in Planck's constant, and find a new electrically charged, static black hole solution. To probe these quantum corrections, we study electromagnetic and gravitational (axial) perturbations on this background, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler master equations that govern the propagation of these waves. In the classical limit our results agree with previous findings in the literature. We finally compare these results with those that one can obtain by working out the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. We find again a new electrically charged static black hole spacetime, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler equations governing the propagation of axial electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Results are qualitatively similar in both cases.

Abstract: Considering accretion onto a charged dilaton black hole, the fundamental equations governing accretion, general analytic expressions for critical points, critical velocity, critical speed of sound, and ultimately the mass accretion rate are obtained. A new constraint on the dilation parameter coming from string theory is found and the case for polytropic gas is delved into a detailed discussion. It is found that the dialtion and the adiabatic index of accreted material have deep effects on the accretion process.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravitational tunneling effects are expected to give rise to a number of interesting observable phenomena, including, in particular, the evolution of black holes at the end of their existence or the emergence of the early universe from a quantum phase. Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity provides a framework to study these phenomena, yet a precise identification of tunneling processes is still not known. Motivated by this question, we consider a related, simpler case, that of Ponzano-Regge amplitudes: we find a surprising and detailed analogy of a class of simple transition amplitudes with tunneling processes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Inflation with Null Energy Condition Violation from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a cornerstone of general relativity, and its violation could leave observable imprints in the cosmic gravitational wave spectrum. Theoretical models suggest that NEC violations during inflation can amplify the primordial tensor power spectrum, leading to distinct features in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we search for these NEC-violating signatures in the SGWB using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. Our analysis reveals no statistically significant evidence of such signals, allowing us to place stringent upper limits on the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. Specifically, we find that $P_{T,2} \lesssim 0.15$ at a $95\%$ confidence level. Notably, this upper limit is consistent with constraints derived from pulsar timing array observations, reinforcing the hypothesis that NEC violations during inflation could explain the signal detected by pulsar timing arrays. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the early Universe and highlight the potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments in probing the physics of inflation and NEC violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a classical fractional particle model in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, extending the Newtonian particle concept with the incorporation of the fractional Laplacian. A comprehensive discussion on kinetic properties, including linear momentum and kinetic energy, is provided. We further derive the equations of motion and discuss the symmetries of the system. The Green's function method is employed to solve the equations of motion in a general case. We illustrate the theory with three important examples: the free fractional particle, the fractional harmonic oscillator, and the charged fractional particle that interacts locally with the electromagnetic field. We use the results of the extension problem by Caffarelli and Silvestre, to construct the associated classical local sigma model for the fractional particle. The sigma model is then quantized using the canonical quantization method, and we compute the vacuum energy at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Mean-Motion Resonances With Interfering Density Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of two less massive objects moving around a central massive object, which are all embedded within a thin accretion disc. In addition to the gravitational interaction between these objects, the disc-object interaction is also crucial for describing the long-term dynamics of the multi-body system, especially in the regime of mean-motion resonances. We point out that near the resonance the density waves generated by the two moving objects generally coherently interfere with each other, giving rise to extra angular momentum fluxes. The resulting backreaction on the objects is derived within the thin-disc scenario, which explicitly depends on the resonant angle and sensitively depends on the smoothing scheme used in the two-dimensional theory. We have performed hydrodynamical simulations with planets embedded within a thin accretion disc and have found qualitatively agreement on the signatures of interfering density waves by measuring the torques on the embedded objects. By including in interference torque and the migration torques in the evolution of a pair of planets, we show that the chance of resonance trapping depends on the sign of the interference torque. For negative torques the pairs are more likely located at off-resonance regimes. The negative torques may also explain the $1\%-2\%$ offset (for the period ratios) from the exact resonance values as observed in {\it Kepler} multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>State-independent Black Hole Interiors from the Crossed Product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Opinion is divided about the nature of state dependence in the black hole interior. Some argue that it is a necessary feature, while others argue it is a bug. In this paper, we consider the extended half-sided modular translation $U(s_0)$ (with $s_0 &gt; 0$) of Leutheusser and Liu that takes us inside the horizon. We note that we can use this operator to construct a modular Hamiltonian $H$ and a conjugation $J$ on the infalling time-evolved wedges. The original thermofield double translates to a new cyclic and separating vector in the shifted algebra. We use these objects and the Connes cocycle to repeat Witten's crossed product construction in this new setting, and to obtain a Type II$_\infty$ algebra that is independent of the various choices, in particular that of the cyclic separating vector. Our emergent times are implicitly boundary-dressed. But if one admits an ``extra'' observer in the interior, we argue that the (state-independent) algebra can be Type I or Type II$_1$ instead of Type II$_\infty$, depending on whether the observer's light cone contains an entire Cauchy slice or not. Along with these general considerations, we present some specific calculations in the setting of the Poincare BTZ black hole. We identify a generalization of modular translations in BTZ-Kruskal coordinates that is pointwise (as opposed to non-local) and is analytically tractable, exploiting a connection with the covering AdS-space. These evolutions can reach the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model that modifies general relativity on cosmological scales, specifically by having a `glitch' in the gravitational constant between the cosmological (super-horizon) and Newtonian (sub-horizon) regimes, as motivated e.g. in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz proposal or in the Einstein-aether framework. This gives a single-parameter extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, which is equivalent to adding a dark energy component, but where the energy density of this component can have either sign. Fitting to data from the Planck satellite, we find that negative contributions are, in fact, preferred. Additionally, we find that roughly one percent weaker superhorizon gravity can somewhat ease the Hubble and clustering tensions in a range of cosmological observations, although at the expense of spoiling fits to the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale in galaxy surveys. Therefore, the extra parametric freedom offered by our model deserves further exploration, and we discuss how future observations may elucidate this potential cosmic glitch in gravity, through a four-fold reduction in statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09831v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the holographic descriptions of Kerr black holes indicate that the conformal or the warped conformal symmetries are responsible for the Kerr black hole physics at both background and perturbation levels. In the present paper, we extend the validity of these studies to the case of accelerating Kerr black hole. By invoking a set of non-trivial diffeomorphisms near the horizon bifurcation surface of the accelerating Kerr black hole, the Dirac brackets among charges of the diffeomorphisms form the symmetry algebra of a warped CFT which consists of one Virasoro and one Kac-Moody algebra with central extensions. This provides the evidence for warped CFTs being possible holographic dual to accelerating Kerr black holes. The thermal entropy formula of the warped CFT fixed by modular parameters and vacuum charges reproduces the entropy of the rotating black hole with acceleration.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Amplification of genuine tripartite nonlocality and entanglement in the Schwarzschild spacetime under decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the amplification of the genuine tripartite nonlocality(GTN) and the genuine tripartite entanglement(GTE) of Dirac particles in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole by a local filtering operation under decoherence. It is shown that the physically accessible GTN will be completely destroyed by decoherence, which means that the physically accessible GTN will not exist in the system. Particularly, the local filtering operation can make the physically accessible GTN appear within a certain range of Hawking temperature, namely, the local filtering operation can cause the physically accessible GTN to be generated in the system coupled with the environment, which is not discovered before and is benefit for the quantum information processing. Furthermore, we also find that the physically accessible GTE approaches a stable value in the limit of infinite Hawking temperature for most cases, but if the decoherence parameter $p$ is less than 1, the ``sudden death'' of GTE will take place when the decoherence strength is large enough. It is worth noting that the nonzero stable value of GTE can be increased by performing the local filtering operation, even in the presence of decoherence. Finally, we explore the generation of physically inaccessible GTN and GTE of other tripartite subsystems under decoherence, it is shown that the physically inaccessible GTN cannot be produced, but the physically inaccessible GTE can be produced. In addition, we can see that the generated physically inaccessible GTE can be increased by applying the local filtering operation.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the presence of non-conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behaviour of a chaotic system and its effect on existing quantum correlation has been holographically studied in presence of non-conformality. Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the non-conformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both the Lyapunov exponent and as well as butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$ known as Gubser bound in the literature. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the thermo mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it has been observed. Finally, the obtained results for the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity have also been computed from the pole-skipping analysis. The results from the two approaches agree with each other.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Restoration and Uniformly Accelerated Observers in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reassess the problem of symmetry restoration induced by observers' acceleration within the context of interacting quantum field theories in Minkowski spacetime. We argue that the imposition of a frame-independent renormalization condition negates any observed symmetry restoration by a Rindler observer. Technically, we compute the one-loop effective potential of a $\lambda\varphi^4$ theory for an accelerated observer, employing a distinct methodology from prior investigations. Emphasizing the intricacies of the model's renormalization, the analysis offers novel insights into the interplay between acceleration and spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Probing ultralight isospin-violating mediators at GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from binary neutron star mergers offer new, sensitive probes to ultralight mediators. Here we analyze the GW signals in the GW170817 event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration to impose constraints on the ultralight isospin-violating mediator that has different couplings to protons and neutrons. Neutron stars, which primarily consist of neutrons, are the ideal places to probe the isospin-violating mediator. Such a mediator can significantly alter the dynamics of the binary neutron star mergers, through both the long-range Yukawa force and the new dipole radiation. We compute the gravitational waveform by taking into account the new physics effects due to the isospin-violating mediator and use the Bayesian inference to analyze the gravitational wave data in the GW170817 event. We find that although the current fifth force experiments (including MICROSCOPE and EW) often provide more stringent constraints than the GW170817 data, in the parameter space where the isospin-violating force is completely screened by the Earth (namely, the Earth is charge neutral under this force), the GW170817 data offer the leading constraints: the upper bound on the neutron coupling is $f_n \lesssim 10^{-19}$ in the mediator mass range of $\simeq(3\times10^{-16},\,5\times10^{-14})$ eV.</description>

      <title>A Radical Solution to the Hubble Tension Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has proven to be stubbornly persistent, despite widespread efforts to relax it. As a possible resolution of this problem we propose a radical alternative to the way in which cosmological models are viewed. Specifically, we consider building cosmological models from spaces that exhibit intrinsic symmetries, rather than as space-times with explicit symmetry. This change in perspective allows statistical homogeneity and isotropy to be maintained, while relaxing some strong mathematical constraints that the standard approach imposes. We show that a Hubble tension arises naturally in our new approach, and that (as a corollary) a prediction can be made for the radial component of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Our prediction appears to be consistent with the DESI first-year data release, which has otherwise been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical solution of black hole information paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only far from the black hole horizon, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom closer to the horizon. The later degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied with additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of $\Lambda$CDM best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmology as automorphic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit pure quantum cosmology in three dimensions. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be solved perturbatively and the dynamics reduces to a particle on moduli space. Its time evolution is equivalent to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Focusing on spacetimes with torus slices, we show that inflationary cosmologies correspond to particle trajectories in Artin's billiard. The resulting automorphic dynamics is developed both from a first and second quantized perspectives. Our main application is to give an interpretation for the Hartle-Hawking state which is here the analytic continuation of the Maloney-Witten partition function. We obtain its spectral decomposition and an exact representation as an average involving the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</description>
