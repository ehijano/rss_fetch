      <title>Chorus Wave Driven Electron Dynamics in the Van Allen Belts: From Coherence to Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Van Allen radiation belts contain relativistic electrons trapped by Earth's magnetic field, posing serious risks to spacecraft. Chorus waves are known to accelerate these electrons via resonant interactions, but these interactions are inherently nonlinear and coherent. How such processes shape large-scale electron dynamics remains unresolved. Two competing paradigms, nonlinear advection and diffusive transport, have been debated for decades. Here, we address this controversy using large-scale first-principles simulations that self-consistently generate realistic chorus wave fields, coupled with test particle modeling. We find that electron motion is coherent on short timescales comparable to or less than a bounce period but becomes stochastic over longer timescales due to phase decorrelation. The resulting transport coefficients support the use of quasilinear diffusion theory for long-term evolution. This work bridges microscopic nonlinear physics with macroscopic modeling frameworks, offering a unified explanation of radiation belt dynamics and advancing the foundation for space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Neural network ensemble for computing cross sections for rotational transitions in H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water (H$_2$O) is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe and is found in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. Rotational transitions in H$_2$O + H$_2$O collisions are important in modeling environments rich in water molecules but they are computationally intractable using quantum mechanical methods. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an ensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a database of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in collisions of complex molecules such as water. The proposed methodology utilizes data computed with a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT). We illustrate that efficient ML models using NN can be built to accurately interpolate in the space of 12 quantum numbers for rotational transitions in two asymmetric top molecules, spanning both initial and final states. We examine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy, symmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational transitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about 10\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of state-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with average relative root mean square error of 0.409. Thermally averaged cross sections, computed using the predicted state-to-state cross sections ($\sim$90\%) and the data used for training and validation ($\sim$10\%) were compared against those obtained entirely from MQCT calculations. The agreement is found to be excellent with an average percent deviation of about $\sim$13.5\%. The methodology is robust, and thus, applicable to other complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>The Sustainability of the Leo Orbit Capacity via Risk-Driven Active Debris Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing number of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) jeopardizes long-term orbital sustainability, requiring efficient risk assessment for active debris removal (ADR) missions. This study presents the development and validation of Filtered Modified MITRI (FMM), an enhanced risk index designed to improve the prioritization of high-criticality debris. Leveraging the MOCAT-MC simulation framework, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis to probe the robustness of the FMM formulation. The results demonstrate that while the FMM provides superior identification of high-risk targets for annual removal campaigns, a nuanced performance trade-off exists between risk models depending on the operational removal cadence. The analysis also confirms that physically grounded mass terms are indispensable for practical risk assessment. By providing a validated open source tool and critical insights into the dynamics of risk, this research enhances our ability to select optimal ADR targets and ensure the long-term viability of LEO operations.</description>
