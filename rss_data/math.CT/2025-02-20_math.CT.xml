      <title>Learning Is a Kan Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that efficient algorithms exist for computing Kan extensions and that some Kan extensions have interesting similarities to various machine learning algorithms. This paper closes the gap by proving that all error minimisation algorithms may be presented as a Kan extension. This result provides a foundation for future work to investigate the optimisation of machine learning algorithms through their presentation as Kan extensions. A corollary of this representation of error-minimising algorithms is a presentation of error from the perspective of lossy and lossless transformations of data.</description>

      <title>A taxonomy of categories for relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. This paper strives to provide a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'', including their enriched version, further showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The resulting taxonomy aims at bringing clarity and organisation to the numerous related concepts and frameworks occurring in the literature</description>

      <title>Classifying spaces of infinity-sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.10544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of concordance classes of sections of an infinity-sheaf on a manifold is representable, extending a theorem of Madsen and Weiss. This is reminiscent of an h-principle in which the role of isotopy is played by concordance. As an application, we offer an answer to the question: what does the classifying space of a Segal space classify?</description>

      <title>Singular homology of roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend some basic results from the singular homology theory of topological spaces to the setting of \v{C}ech's closure spaces. We prove analogues of the excision and Mayer-Vietoris theorems and the Hurewicz theorem in dimension one. We use these results to calculate examples of singular homology groups of spaces that are not topological but are often encountered in applied topology, such as simple undirected graphs. We focus on the singular homology of roots of unity with closure structures arising from considering nearest neighbors. These examples can then serve as building blocks along with our Mayer-Vietoris and excision theorems for computing the singular homology of more complex closure spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth in doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to incorporate the notion of quantifier-free formulas modulo a first-order theory and the stratification of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a first-order theory into the algebraic treatment of classical first-order logic.
  The set of quantifier-free formulas modulo a theory is axiomatized by what we call a quantifier-free fragment of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Rather than being an intrinsic notion, a quantifier-free fragment is an additional structure on a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Under a smallness assumption, the structures occurring as quantifier-free fragments of some Boolean doctrine with quantifiers are precisely the Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers). In particular, every Boolean doctrine over a small category is a quantifier-free fragment of its quantifier completion.
  Furthermore, the sequences obtained by stratifying an algebra of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a theory are axiomatized by what we call QA-stratified Boolean doctrines. While quantifier-free fragments are defined in relation to an "ambient" Boolean doctrine with quantifiers, a QA-stratified Boolean doctrine requires no such ambient doctrine, and it consists of a sequence of Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers) with connecting axioms. QA-stratified Boolean doctrines are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs consisting of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers and a quantifier-free fragment of it.</description>
