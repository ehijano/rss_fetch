      <title>Homological Mirror Symmetry for orbifold log Calabi-Yau surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct mirror abstract Lefschetz fibrations associated to a class of surfaces with cyclic quotient singularities which we call effective. These surfaces can be obtained by contracting disjoint chains of smooth rational curves inside the anticanonical cycle $D$ of a smooth log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with maximal boundary and considering the result as an orbifold. The Fukaya-Seidel categories of these abstract Lefschetz fibrations admit semiorthogonal decompositions akin to the ones described via the derived special McKay correspondence of Ishii and Ueda arXiv:1104.2381v2 [math.AG]. We apply this construction to establish an equivalence at the large volume limit between the derived category of an effective orbifold log Calabi-Yau surface with points of type $\frac{1}{k}(1,1)$ and the Fukaya-Seidel category of its mirror Lefschetz fibration. We also compare the abstract construction to an explicit Landau-Ginzburg model defined by a Laurent polynomial associated to a toric degeneration in the case of the family of hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}\subset \mathbb{P}(1,1,1,k)$. The hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}$ admit a non-trivial moduli of complex structures, which we compare with an open subset of the space of symplectic structures on the total space of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model via a mirror map built out of intrinsic quantities in a non-exact Fukaya-Seidel category.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Dolgachev's mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, we study its analogue for abelian surfaces. In this paper, we introduce lattice-polarized abelian surfaces and construct their coarse moduli spaces. We then construct stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces for abelian surfaces and show that these two spaces are naturally identified for mirror pairs. We also introduce a natural involution on stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces which, under mirror symmetry, pairs abelian surfaces and their duals. Finally, we determine conditions for the existence of mirror partners and classify self-mirror abelian surfaces via their N\'eron-Severi lattices.</description>

      <title>Kodaira-Spencer theory for Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying Courant algebroids on dg ringed manifolds, we observe that the associated Roytenberg-Weinstein $L_\infty$ algebra admits a local structure reminiscent of a shifted contact structure. On a dg ringed manifold with an $n$-orientation, its symplectification produces a sheaf of $(2-n)$-shifted symplectic formal moduli problems, which we call the Courant contact model. This construction can be interpreted as a ($\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded) theory in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism whenever $n$ is odd. After developing the procedure of reduction and extension of scalars, we show how twisted backgrounds in type I supergravity naturally lead to Courant algebroids over the Dolbeault complex. Specialising to the case of a Calabi-Yau fivefold, we show that the Courant contact model for that Courant algebroid is equivalent to a central extension of minimal type I BCOV theory. Inspired by this, we extend the conjecture of Costello and Li and place it within the setting of generalized geometry, conjecturing a description of the BV formulation of type I supergravity in general twisted backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A Darboux classification of homogeneous Pfaffian forms on graded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local classification problem for differential Pfaffian forms on a supermanifold $M$ that are homogeneous with respect to a given homogeneity structure on $M$. The best-known homogeneity structures are those associated with linearity on a vector bundle. The aim is to show that, for a homogeneous form of given degree, there are `Darboux coordinates' which are homogeneous. As a consequence, we obtain Darboux-type normal pictures for homogeneous forms, recovering the classical Darboux theorems, as well as their contact and presymplectic counterparts as special cases.
  To obtain an analog of Darboux's classification in the supergeometric context, we define a class of a differential form $\alpha$ by the rank of the characteristic distribution $\chi(\alpha)$, being the intersection of kernels of $\alpha$ and $d\alpha$. We show that, under suitable regularity and constant-rank assumptions, this distribution completely controls the local equivalence problem for homogeneous Pfaffian forms. Our results hold as well for ordinary (purely even) manifolds.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local symplectic theory of integrable systems is fundamental to understand their global theory, as well as the behavior near singularities of fundamental models from classical and quantum mechanics which are known to be integrable, such as the Jaynes-Cummings model and the coupled angular momenta. We establish the foundations of the local symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $4$-dimensional $p$-adic analytic symplectic manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices. We show that this approach can be generalized to $p$-adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms, including, up to dimension $4$, the classification in the degenerate case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants. In the present paper we shall prove all of the statements concerning integrable systems; their proofs rely on the $p$-adic analog of the Weierstrass and Williamson theory of matrices. The proofs concerning this new $p$-adic theory of matrices are of an algebraic and arithmetical nature, and we give them in the sequel paper, part II.</description>

      <title>The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric approach to the construction of moment maps in finite and infinite-dimensional complex geometry. We apply this to two settings: K\"ahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles. Our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms.
  For K\"ahler manifolds we give a new, geometric proof of Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature. Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold - namely to a central charge - we further introduce a geometric PDE determining a $Z$-critical K\"ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties. For holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills condition. We then go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE determining a $Z$-critical connection - again associated to a choice of central charge - can be viewed as a moment map; deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry - associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition - and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing PDE counterparts to stability conditions in large generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an obstruction to smoothing stable maps in smooth projective varieties, which generalizes some previously known obstructions. Our obstruction comes from the non-existence of certain rational functions on the ghost components, with prescribed simple poles and residues.</description>

      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>
