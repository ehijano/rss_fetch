      <title>Critical wetting in the (2+1)D Solid-On-Solid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the low temperature $(2+1)$D SOS interface above a hard floor with critical pinning potential $\lambda_w= \log (\frac{1}{1-e^{-4\beta}})$. At $\lambda&lt;\lambda_w$ entropic repulsion causes the surface to delocalize and be rigid at height $\frac1{4\beta}\log n+O(1)$; at $\lambda&gt;\lambda_w$ it is localized at some $O(1)$ height. We show that at $\lambda=\lambda_w$, there is delocalization, with rigidity now at height $\lfloor \frac1{6\beta}\log n+\frac13\rfloor$, confirming a conjecture of Lacoin.</description>

      <title>Optimal withdrawals in a general diffusion model with control rates subject to a state-dependent upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classical stochastic control problem in which a diffusion process is controlled by a withdrawal process up to a termination time. The objective is to maximize the expected discounted value of the withdrawals until the first-passage time below level zero. In this work, we are considering absolutely continuous control strategies in a general diffusion model. Our main contribution is a solution to the control problem under study, which is achieved by using a probabilistic guess-and-verify approach. We prove that the optimal strategy belongs to the family of bang-bang strategies, i.e. strategies in which, above an optimal barrier level, we withdraw at the highest-allowed rate, while no withdrawals are made below this barrier. Some nontrivial examples are studied numerically.</description>

      <title>Cover times with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cover times quantify the speed of exhaustive search. In this work, we compute exactly the mean cover time associated with a one-dimensional Brownian search under exponentially distributed resetting. We also approximate the moments of cover times of a wide range of stochastic search processes in $d$-dimensional continuous space and on an arbitrary discrete network under frequent stochastic resetting. These results hold for a large class of resetting time distributions and search processes including diffusion and Markov jump processes.</description>

      <title>Double dimers on planar hyperbolic graphs via circle packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the double dimer model on hyperbolic Temperleyan graphs via circle packings. We prove that on such graphs, the weak limit of the dimer model exists if and only if the removed black vertex from the boundary of the exhaustion converges to a point on the unit circle in the circle packing representation of the graph. One of our main results is that for such measures, we prove that the double dimer model has no bi-infinite path almost surely. Along the way we prove that the height function of the dimer model has double exponential tail and faces of height larger than k do not percolate for large enough k. The proof uses the connection between winding of uniform spanning trees and dimer heights, the notion of stationary random graphs, and the boundary theory of random walk on circle packings.</description>

      <title>Can one condition a killed random walk to survive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed with probability $p(|x|)$ at site $x$ for a function $p$ decaying at infinity. Due to recurrence in dimension $d=2$, the killed random walk (KRW) dies almost surely if $p$ is positive, while in dimension $d \geq 3$ it is known that the KRW dies almost surely if and only if $\int_0^{\infty}rp(r)dr = \infty$, under mild technical assumptions on $p$. In this paper we consider, for any $d \geq 2$, functions $p$ for which the KRW dies almost surely and we ask ourselves if the KRW conditioned to survive is well-defined. More precisely, given an exhaustion $(\Lambda_R)_{R \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, does the KRW conditioned to leave $\Lambda_R$ before dying converges in distribution towards a limit which does not depend on the exhaustion? We first prove that this conditioning is well-defined for $p(r) = o(r^{-2})$, and that it is not for $p(r) = \min(1, r^{-\alpha})$ for $\alpha \in (14/9,2)$. This question is connected to branching random walks and the infinite snake. More precisely, in dimension $d=4$, the infinite snake is related to the KRW with $p(r) \asymp (r^2\log(r))^{-1}$, therefore our results imply that the infinite snake conditioned to avoid the origin in four dimensions is well-defined.</description>

      <title>Convergence of cluster coagulation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic limits of the cluster coagulation model; a coagulation model introduced by Norris [$\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$, 209(2):407-435 (2000)]. In this process, pairs of particles $x,y$ in a measure space $E$, merge to form a single new particle $z$ according to a transition kernel $K(x, y, \mathrm{d} z)$, in such a manner that a quantity, one may regard as the total mass of the system, is conserved. This model is general enough to incorporate various inhomogeneities in the evolution of clusters, for example, their shape, or their location in space. We derive sufficient criteria for trajectories associated with this process to concentrate among solutions of a generalisation of the $\textit{Flory equation}$, and, in some special cases, by means of a uniqueness result for solutions of this equation, prove a weak law of large numbers. This multi-type Flory equation is associated with $\textit{conserved quantities}$ associated with the process, which may encode different information to conservation of mass (for example, conservation of centre of mass in spatial models). We also apply criteria for gelation in this process to derive sufficient criteria for this equation to exhibit gelling solutions. When this occurs, this multi-type Flory equation encodes, via the associated conserved property, the interaction between the gel and the finite size sol particles.</description>

      <title>Small maximal clusters are very unlikely in critical random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a probabilistic methodology, based on random walk estimates, to obtain exponential upper bounds for the probability of observing unusually small maximal components in two classical (near-)critical random graph models. More specifically, we analyse the near-critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ and the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ obtained by performing near-critical $p$-bond percolation on a simple random $d$-regular graph and show that, for each one of these models, the probability that the size of a largest component is smaller than $n^{2/3}/A$ is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/2})$. The exponent $3/2$ is known to be optimal for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ random graph, whereas for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ model the best known upper bound for the above probability was of order $A^{-3/5}$. As a secondary result we show, by means of an optimized version of the martingale method of Nachmias and Peres, that the above probability of observing an unusually small maximal component is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/5})$ in other two critical models, namely a random intersection graph and the quantum random graph; this stretched-exponential bounds also improve upon the known (polynomial) bounds available for these other two critical models.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Piecewise-Deterministic-Markov-Processes with Application to Stochastic Calcium Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Large Deviation Principle for Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs). This is an asymptotic estimate for the probability of a trajectory in the large size limit. Explicit Euler-Lagrange equations are determined for computing optimal first-hitting-time trajectories. The results are applied to a model of stochastic calcium dynamics. It is widely conjectured that the mechanism of calcium puff generation is a multiscale process: with microscopic stochastic fluctuations in the opening and closing of individual channels generating cell-wide waves via the diffusion of calcium and other signaling molecules. We model this system as a PDMP, with $N \gg 1$ stochastic calcium channels that are coupled via the ambient calcium concentration. We employ the Large Deviations theory to estimate the probability of cell-wide calcium waves being produced through microscopic stochasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of mean-field reflected backward stochastic differential equations (MF-RBSDEs) driven by a marked point process and also analyze MF-RBSDEs driven by a poission process. Based on a g-expectation representation lemma, we give the existence and uniqueness of the particle system of MF-RBSDEs driven by a marked point process under Lipschitz generator conditions and obtain a convergence of this system. We also establish the well-posedness of the MF-RBSDEs driven by a poission process and the rate of of convergence of the corresponding particle system towards the solution to the MF-RBSDEs driven by a poission process under bounded terminal, bounded obstacle conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the censored fractional Bernstein derivative on the positive half line $(0, \infty)$ based on the Bernstein Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative. This derivative can be shown to be the generator of the censored subordinator by solving a resolvent equation. We also show that the censored subordinator hits the boundary in finite time under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks with Discontinuous Limits and AIMD processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) for which chemical species are created by a sequence of chain reactions. We prove that under some convenient conditions on the initial state, some of these networks exhibit a discrete-induced transitions (DIT) property: isolated, random, events have a direct impact on the macroscopic state of the process. If this phenomenon has already been noticed in several CRNs, in auto-catalytic networks in the literature of physics in particular, there are up to now few rigorous studies in this domain. A scaling analysis of several cases of such CRNs with several classes of initial states is achieved. The DIT property is investigated for the case of a CRN with four nodes. We show that on the normal timescale and for a subset of (large) initial states and for convenient Skorohod topologies, the scaled process converges in distribution to a Markov process with jumps, an Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) process. This asymptotically discontinuous limiting behavior is a consequence of a DIT property due to random, local, blowups of jumps occurring during small time intervals. With an explicit representation of invariant measures of AIMD processes and time-change arguments, we show that, with a speed-up of the timescale, the scaled process is converging in distribution to a continuous deterministic function. The DIT analyzed in this paper is connected to a simple chain reaction between three chemical species and is therefore likely to be a quite generic phenomenon for a large class of CRNs.</description>

      <title>The contact process on dynamical random trees with degree dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple model for the spread of an infection in a structured population. We investigate the case when the underlying structure evolves dynamically as a degree-dependent dynamical percolation model. Starting with a connected locally finite base graph we initially declare edges independently open with a probability that is allowed to depend on the degree of the adjacent vertices and closed otherwise. Edges are independently updated with a rate depending on the degrees and then are again declared open and closed with the same probabilities. We are interested in the contact process, where infections are only allowed to spread via open edges. Our aim is to analyze the impact of the update speed and the probability for edges to be open on the existence of a phase transition. For a general connected locally finite graph, our first result gives sufficient conditions for the critical value for survival to be strictly positive. Furthermore, in the setting of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees, we show that the process survives strongly with positive probability for any infection rate if the offspring distribution has a stretched exponential tail with an exponent depending on the percolation probability and the update speed. In particular, if the offspring distribution follows a power law and the connection probability is given by a product kernel and the update speed exhibits polynomial behaviour, we provide a complete characterisation of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Non-central limit of densities of some functionals of Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of the densities of a sequence of nonlinear functionals of an underlying Gaussian process to the density of a Gamma distribution. We provide precise estimates on the distance between densities while developing the techniques of Malliavin calculus and Stein's method suitable to Gamma approximation. We first focus our study on the case of random variables living in a fixed Wiener chaos of an even order for which the bound for the difference of the densities can be dominated by a linear combination of moments up to order four. We then study the case of general Gaussian functionals with possibly infinite chaos expansion. Finally, we provide two applications of our results, namely the limit of random variables living in the second Wiener chaos, and the limit of sums of independent Pareto distributed random variables.</description>

      <title>Useful stochastic bounds in time-varying queues with service and patience times having general joint distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a first-come, first-served single server queue with an initial workload $x&gt;0$ and customers who arrive according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function $\lambda:[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\lambda_h ]$ for some $\lambda_h&gt;0$. For each $i\in\mathbb{N}$, let $S_i$ (resp., $Y_i$) be the service (resp., patience) time of the $i$'th customer and assume that $(S_1,Y_1),(S_2,Y_2),\ldots$ is an iid sequence of bivariate random vectors with non-negative coordinates. A customer joins if and only if his patience time is not less than his prospective waiting time (i.e., the left-limit of the workload process at his arrival epoch). Let $\tau(x)$ be the first time when the system becomes empty and let $N^*_\lambda(\cdot)$ be the arrival process of those who join the queue. In the present work we suggest a novel coupling technique which is applied to derive stochastic upper bounds for the functionals: \begin{equation*}
  \int_0^{\tau(x)}g\circ W_x(t){\rm d}t\ \ \text{and}\ \ \int_0^{\tau(x)}g\circ W_x(t){\rm d}N^*_\lambda(t)\,, \end{equation*} where $W_x(\cdot)$ is the workload process in the queue and $g(\cdot)$ is any lower semi-continuous function. We also demonstrate how to utilise these bounds via some examples under the additional assumption that $\lambda(\cdot)$ is periodic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of noisy SVGD outside the population limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a widely used sampling algorithm that has been successfully applied in several areas of Machine Learning. SVGD operates by iteratively moving a set of  interacting particles (which represent the samples) to approximate the target distribution. Despite recent studies on the complexity of SVGD and its variants, their long-time asymptotic behavior (i.e., after numerous iterations ) is still not understood in the finite number of particles regime. We study the long-time asymptotic behavior of a noisy variant of SVGD. First, we establish that the limit set of noisy SVGD for large  is well-defined. We then characterize this limit set, showing that it approaches the target distribution as  increases. In particular, noisy SVGD provably avoids the variance collapse observed for SVGD. Our approach involves demonstrating that the trajectories of noisy SVGD closely resemble those described by a McKean-Vlasov process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use representation theory of the symmetric group S_n to prove Poisson limit theorems for the distribution of fixed points for three types of non-uniform permutations. First, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g and x are uniform in S_n. Second, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g is uniform in S_n and x is fixed. Third, we give results for permutations obtained by multiplying n*log(n)/2 + cn random transpositions, as well as a conjecture related to the more general i-cycle walk. Most of our results are known by other, quite different, methods.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this study formulates the Epstein-Zin (EZ) preference for the discounted dividend (or cash payouts) of stockholders as an EZ singular control utility. We show that such a problem is well-defined and equivalent to the robust dividend policy set by the firm's executive in the sense of Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. While the firm's executive announces the expected future earnings in financial reports, they also signal the firm's confidence in the expected earnings through dividend or cash payouts. The robust dividend policy can then be characterized by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequality (VI). By constructing a novel shooting method for the HJB-VI, we theoretically prove that the robust dividend policy is a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <title>Slow rates of approximation of U-statistics and V-statistics by quadratic forms of Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct examples of degree-two U- and V-statistics of $n$ i.i.d.~heavy-tailed random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{d(n)}$, whose $\nu$-th moments exist for ${\nu &gt; 2}$, and provide tight bounds on the error of approximating both statistics by a quadratic form of Gaussians. In the case ${\nu=3}$, the error of approximation is $\Theta(n^{-1/12})$. The proof adapts a result of Huang, Austern and Orbanz [12] to U- and V-statistics. The lower bound for U-statistics is a simple example of the concept of variance domination used in [12].</description>

      <title>Almost-everywhere uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories for $3$D Navier--Stokes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for any Leray solution $u$ to the $3$D Navier--Stokes equations with $u_0\in L^2$, the associated Lagrangian trajectories are unique for Lebesgue a.e. initial condition. Additionally, if $u_0\in H^{1/2}$, then pathwise uniqueness is established for the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories starting from every initial condition. The result sharpens and extends the original one by Robinson and Sadowski (Nonlinearity 2009) and is based on rather different techniques. A key role is played by a newly established asymmetric Lusin--Lipschitz property of Leray solutions $u$, in the framework of (random) Regular Lagrangian flows.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides some perspectives on why the time and variance schedule used in [Karras et al. 2022] could be better tuned than the pioneering version in [Song et al. 2020].</description>

      <title>Cutoff Phenomenon for Cyclic Dynamics on Hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.01756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomena for Markovian dynamics have been observed and rigorously verified for a multitude of models, particularly for Glauber-type dynamics on spin systems. However, prior studies have barely considered irreversible chains. In this work, the cutoff phenomenon of certain cyclic dynamics are studied on the hypercube $\Sigma_{n} = Q^{V_{n}}$, where $Q = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $V_{n} = \{1,...,n\}$. The main feature of these dynamics is the fact that they are represented by an irreversible Markov chain. Based on the coupling modifications suggested in a previous study of the cutoff phenomenon for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model, a comprehensive proof is presented.</description>

      <title>First passage percolation in hostile environment is not monotone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a natural growth process with competition, modeled by two first passage percolation processes, $FPP_1$ and $FPP_\lambda$, spreading on a graph. $FPP_1$ starts at the origin and spreads at rate $1$, whereas $FPP_\lambda$ starts from a random set of \emph{inactive seeds} distributed as Bernoulli percolation of parameter $\mu\in (0,1)$. A seed of $FPP_\lambda$ gets activated when one of the two processes attempts to occupy its location, and from this moment onwards spreads at some fixed rate $\lambda&gt;0$. In previous works~[17, 3, 7] it has been shown that when both $\mu$ or $\lambda$ are small enough, then $FPP_1$ \emph{survives} (i.e., it occupies an infinite set of vertices) with positive probability. It might seem intuitive that decreasing $\mu$ or $\lambda$ is beneficial to $FPP_1$. However, we prove that, in general, this is indeed false by constructing a graph for which the probability that $FPP_1$ survives is not a monotone function of $\mu$ or $\lambda$, implying the existence of multiple phase transitions. This behavior contrasts with other natural growth processes such as the $2$-type Richardson model.</description>

      <title>An OSSS-type inequality for uniformly drawn subsets of fixed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The OSSS inequality [O'Donnell, Saks, Schramm and Servedio, 46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05), Pittsburgh (2005)] gives an upper bound for the variance of a function f of independent 0-1 valued random variables, in terms of the influences of these random variables and the computational complexity of a (randomised) algorithm for determining the value of f. Duminil-Copin, Raoufi and Tassion [Annals of Mathematics 189, 75-99 (2019)] obtained a generalization to monotonic measures and used it to prove new results for Potts models and random-cluster models. Their generalization of the OSSS inequality raises the question if there are still other measures for which a version of that inequality holds. We derive a version of the OSSS inequality for a family of measures that are far from monotonic, namely the k-out-of-n measures (these measures correspond with drawing k elements from a set of size n uniformly). We illustrate the inequality by studying the event that there is an occupied horizontal crossing of an R times R box on the triangular lattice in the site percolation model where exactly half of the vertices in the box are occupied.</description>

      <title>Ancestral reproductive bias in continuous time branching trees under various sampling schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cheek and Johnston (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023) consider a continuous-time Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson tree conditioned on being alive at time $T$. They study the reproduction events along the ancestral lineage of an individual randomly sampled from all those alive at time $T$. We give a short proof of an extension of their main results to the more general case of Bellman-Harris processes. Our proof also sheds light onto the probabilistic structure of the rate of the reproduction events. A similar method will be applied to explain (i) the different ancestral reproduction bias appearing in work by Geiger (Journal of Applied Probability, 1999) and (ii) the fact that the sampling rule considered by Chauvin, Rouault and Wakolbinger (Stochastic Processes and their Applications, 1991) leads to a time homogeneous process along the ancestral lineage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we study the long-term behaviour of the non-explosion probability for continuous-state branching processes in a L\'evy environment when the branching mechanism is given by the negative of the Laplace exponent of a subordinator. In order to do so, we study the law of this family of processes in the infinite mean case and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the process to be conservative, i.e. that the process does not explode in finite time a.s. In addition, we establish precise rates for the non-explosion probabilities in the subcritical and critical regimes, first found by Palau et al. [19] in the case when the branching mechanism is given by the negative of the Laplace exponent of a stable subordinator.</description>

Besides, we study the reflections for the particle system and obtain the rate of of convergence of the particle system towards the deterministic flat solution to the mean reflected BSDEJ.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$. We also obtain an explicit formula for the expected value of the left-to-right maximum statistic $X_n^{\text{LR-max}}$, which counts the total number of left-to-right maxima in a permutation, and show that $E_n^{\text{park}}X_n^{\text{LR-max}}$ grows approximately on the order $n^\frac12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish limit theorems for the maxima and minima of Airy$_1$ and Airy$_2$ processes (denoted by $\mathcal{A}_1(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{A}_2(\cdot)$ respectively) over growing intervals. In particular, we identify the finite non-zero constants that are the almost sure limits of $(\log t)^{-2/3}\max_{0\le s \le t} \mathcal{A}_{i}(s)$ and $(\log t)^{-1/3}\min_{0\le s \le t} \mathcal{A}_{i}(s)$ for $i=1,2$. This complements and extends the results of (Pu, 2023), where the question for the maxima was considered and the order of growth was identified for both $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$ and the constant was identified for $\mathcal{A}_1$. Our approach is different from that of (Pu, 2023); instead of complicated formulae for multi-point distributions, we rely on the well-known convergence of passage time profiles in planar exponential last passage percolation started from different initial conditions to $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$, together with the recently developed sharp one-point estimates in (Baslingker et al., 2024) for the point-to-point and point-to-line passage times in exponential LPP and a combination of old and new results on the geometry of the LPP landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be considered as a zeta function over F_1. This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute zeta function. First we deal with a zeta function determined by a time evolution matrix of the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of the quantum walk. Then we prove that the zeta function given by the quantum walk is an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the number of edges of the graph. Furthermore we consider an absolute zeta function for the zeta function based on a quantum walk. As an example, we compute an absolute zeta function for the cycle graph and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma function of order 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$. Here, rather than a `short' two-dimensional needle, we analytically solve the problems with two- and three-dimensional needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for various physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit, momentum-based dynamics for optimizing functions defined on Lie groups was recently constructed, based on techniques such as variational optimization and left trivialization. We appropriately add tractable noise to the optimization dynamics to turn it into a sampling dynamics, leveraging the advantageous feature that the trivialized momentum variable is Euclidean despite that the potential function lives on a manifold. We then propose a Lie-group MCMC sampler, by delicately discretizing the resulting kinetic-Langevin-type sampling dynamics. The Lie group structure is exactly preserved by this discretization. Exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then proved under $W_2$ distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically $L$-smoothness of the potential function are needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for kinetic Langevin on curved spaces, and also the first quantitative result that requires no convexity or, at least not explicitly, any common relaxation such as isoperimetry.</description>

Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
