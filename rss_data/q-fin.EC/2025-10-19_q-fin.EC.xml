      <title>A physically extended EEIO framework for material efficiency assessment in United States manufacturing supply chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical assessment of material flows in an economy (e.g., material flow quantification) can support the development of sustainable decarbonization and circularity strategies by providing the tangible physical context of industrial production quantities and supply chain relationships. However, completing a physical assessment is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality raw data and poor harmonization across industry classification systems used in data reporting. Here we describe a new physical extension for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) EEIO for Industrial Decarbonization (EEIO-IDA) model, yielding an expanded EEIO model that is both physically and environmentally extended. In the model framework, the U.S. economy is divided into goods-producing and service-producing subsectors, and mass flows are quantified for each goods-producing subsector using a combination of trade data (e.g., UN Comtrade) and physical production data (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey). Given that primary-source production data are not available for all subsectors, price-imputation and mass-balance assumptions are developed and used to complete the physical flows dataset with high-quality estimations. The resulting dataset, when integrated with the EEIO-IDA tool, enables the quantification of environmental impact intensity metrics on a mass basis (e.g., CO$_2$eq/kg)) for each industrial subsector. This work is designed to align with existing DOE frameworks and tools, including the EEIO-IDA tool, the DOE Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap (2022), and Pathways for U.S. Industrial Transformations study (2025).</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions in Academic Dishonesty: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Exam Script Swapping Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel game theoretic framework for analyzing academic dishonesty through the lens of a unique deterrent mechanism: forced exam script swapping between students caught copying. We model the strategic interactions between students as a non cooperative game with asymmetric information and examine three base scenarios asymmetric preparation levels, mutual non preparation, and coordinated partial preparation. Our analysis reveals that the script swapping punishment creates a stronger deterrent effect than traditional penalties by introducing strategic interdependence in outcomes. The Nash equilibrium analysis demonstrates that mutual preparation emerges as the dominant strategy. The framework provides insights for institutional policy design, suggesting that unconventional punishment mechanisms that create mutual vulnerability can be more effective than traditional individual penalties. Future empirical validation and behavioral experiments are proposed to test the model predictions, including explorations of tapering off effects in punishment severity over time.</description>

      <title>International migration and dietary diversity of left-behind households: evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the impact of international migration on the food consumption and dietary diversity of left-behind households. Using the Kerala migration survey 2011, we study whether households with emigrants (on account of international migration) have higher consumption expenditure and improved dietary diversity than their non-migrating counterparts. We use ordinary least square and instrumental variable approach to answer this question. The key findings are that: a) emigrant households have higher overall consumption expenditure as well as higher expenditure on food; b) we find that international migration leads to increase in the dietary diversity of left behind households. Further, we explore the effect on food sub-group expenditure for both rural and urban households. We find that emigrant households spend more on protein (milk, pulses and egg, fish and meat), at the same time there is higher spending on non-healthy food habits (processed and ready to eat food items) among them.</description>

      <title>Impact of Three-Point Rule Change on Competitive Balance in Football: A Synthetic Control Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governing authorities in sports often make changes to rules and regulations to increase competitiveness. One such change was made by the English Football Association in 1981 when it changed the rule for awarding points in the domestic league from two points for a win to three points. This study aims to measure this rule change's impact on the domestic league's competitive balance using a quasi-experimental estimation design of a synthetic control method. The three-point rule change led to an increase in competitive balance in the English League. Further, we show no significant change in the number of goals scored per match.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity among migrants, education-occupation mis-match and returns to education: Evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nationally representative data for India, this paper examines the incidence of education occupation mismatch and returns to education and EOM for internal migrants while considering the heterogeneity among them. In particular, this study considers heterogeneity arising because of the reason to migrate, demographic characteristics, spatial factors, migration experience, and type of migration. The analysis reveals that there exists variation in the incidence and returns to EOM depending on the reason to migrate, demographic characteristics, and spatial factors. The study highlights the need of focusing on EOM to increase the productivity benefits of migration. It also provides the framework for minimizing migrants' likelihood of being mismatched while maximizing their returns to education.</description>

      <title>Political Interventions to Reduce Single-Use Plastics (SUPs) and Price Effects: An Event Study for Austria and Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-use plastics (SUPs) create large environmental costs. After Directive (EU) 2019/904, Austria and Germany introduced producer charges and fund payments meant to cover clean-up work. Using a high-frequency panel of retail offer spells containing prices and a fixed-effects event study with two-way clustered standard errors, this paper measures how much these costs drive up consumer prices. We find clear price pass-through in Austria. When Austrian products are pooled, treated items are 13.01 index points higher than non-SUP controls within twelve months (DiD(12m); p&lt;0.001) and 19.42 points over the full post period (p&lt;0.001). By product, balloons show strong and lasting effects (DiD(12m)=13.43, p=0.007; Full DiD=19.96, p&lt;0.001). Cups show mixed short-run movements (e.g., DiD(12m)=-22.73, p=0.096) and a positive but imprecise full-period contrast.</description>

      <title>AI Adoption in NGOs: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions, contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity, Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy in the Werewolf Game: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal strategies in the Werewolf Game-a widely played strategic social deduction game involving two opposing factions-from a game-theoretic perspective. We consider two scenarios: the game without a prophet and the game with a prophet. In the scenario without a prophet, we propose an enhanced strategy called ``random strategy+'' that significantly improves the werewolf group's winning probability over conventional random strategies. In the scenario with a prophet, we reformulate the game as an extensive-form Bayesian game under a specific constraint, and derive the prophet's optimal strategy that induces a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE). This study provides a rigorous analytical framework for modeling the Werewolf Game and offers broader insights into strategic decision-making under asymmetric and incomplete information.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to the cloud: Cloud technology use and growth rates in small and large firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence shows that investments in ICT disproportionately improve the performance of larger firms versus smaller ones. However, ICT may not be all alike, as they differ in their impact on firms' organisational structure. We investigate the effect of the use of cloud services on the long run size growth rate of French firms. We find that cloud services positively impact firms' growth rates, with smaller firms experiencing more significant benefits compared to larger firms. Our findings suggest cloud technologies help reduce barriers to digitalisation, which affect especially smaller firms. By lowering these barriers, cloud adoption enhances scalability and unlocks untapped growth potential.</description>
