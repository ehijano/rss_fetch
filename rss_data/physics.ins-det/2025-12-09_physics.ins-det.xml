      <title>Autoencoder-based time series anomaly detection for ATLAS Liquid Argon calorimeter data quality monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment at the LHC employs comprehensive data quality monitoring procedures to ensure high-quality physics data. This contribution presents a long short-term memory autoencoder-based algorithm for detecting anomalies in ATLAS Liquid Argon calorimeter data, represented as multidimensional time series of statistical moments of energy cluster properties. Trained on good-quality data, the model identifies anomalous intervals. Validation is performed using a known short-term issue of noise bursts, and the potential for broader application to transient calorimeter issues is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quenching factors for Na recoils as a function of Tl dopant concentrations in NaI(Tl) crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba.</description>

      <title>Detuning-insensitive wide-field imaging of vector microwave fields with diamond sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rm{\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The program Simourg (Simulator of Usually Requested Geometries) is based on the Geant4 toolkit and created for Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-ray spectrometric nuclear detectors with a simple axial symmetric geometry, which is typical for many tasks of studying the decay of long-lived nuclei and measuring the radioactivity of natural objects. The program is designed for quick estimation of the effectiveness and the response function of the detector to monoenergetic gamma quanta in the energy range from keV to several MeV.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of optical photon propagation in low photon yield applications: Opticks for the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\sim60\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\sim20\,\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).</description>

      <title>Filters and Redundancies: An Exploration of Novel Coherent Noise Filters for High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents radiation-tolerant implementations for the SALSA front-end readout ASIC through redundancy methods applied to two median-finding algorithms designed for coherent noise suppression. Bit-wise Median Finder (BWMF) and Combinatorial Sum Median Finder (CSMF) were implemented in TSMC \SI{65}{\nano\meter} and evaluated in terms of area, power, and latency. Three redundancy techniques were applied in this work to compare their impact: simple TMR, full TMR, and temporal TMR (TTMR). The simple and full TMR approach was applied in both algorithms to establish comparisons and TTMR was applied to CSMF as an improvement. The results indicate that the BWMF achieves efficient performance in terms of area and power under the simple TMR scheme, but exhibits significantly higher power consumption when using the more robust full TMR approach. The TTMR technique, in turn, offers reliable fault tolerance while maintaining a feasible balance between area and power.</description>

      <title>Observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on Al2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on aluminum in a cryogenic Al$_2$O$_3$ detector developed by the NUCLEUS collaboration for the detection of reactor neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CEvNS) process. Data collected at the Technical University of Munich in 2024 with a $^{252}$Cf source reveal a main recoil line at 1145 eV from single-$\gamma$ de-excitation of $^{28}$Al and a newly observed structure near 575 eV originating from several two-$\gamma$ cascades. The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$\gamma$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $\gamma$-ray in the cascade. These results demonstrate the potential performance of the CRAB (Calibration Recoil for Accurate Bolometry) method for in situ nuclear recoil calibration and highlight the importance of accurately modeling recoil stopping and nuclear de-excitation times in cryogenic detectors of CEvNS and dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Lineshape response of plastic scintillator to pair production of 4.44 MeV gamma's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the distribution of energy deposited in a 40x88 mm plastic scintillator by e+ e- pair production of 4.44 MeV gamma-rays. We observe the double-escape peak of 3.42 MeV from pair production by tagging 511 keV annihilation radiation in two high-Z scintillators. The source is a standard commercial neutron source using alpha-emitting 241Am encapsulated with 9Be, which has a reaction branch feeding the first Ipi=2+ state of 12C making the 4.44 MeV gamma-rays. We demonstrate the extraction of the double-escape peak from the large neutron-produced backgound, and explore some of the features and difficulties of this technique with our apparatus.</description>

      <title>Optimization of gain uniformity in thermal bonding Micromegas for the PandaX-III experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-pattern gas detectors (MPGDs) are widely utilized in physics experiments owing to their excellent spatial resolution and high-rate capabilities. Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of &lt; 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Error Correcting Method for Magnetic-Array-Type Current Sensors in Multi-Core Cable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7{\deg}$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.</description>

      <title>Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.</description>

      <title>Laser-written reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit directly coupled to a single-photon avalanche diode array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams. The present article touches the topic of getting circle on resonance limit and the deflection sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have proven themselves as a good, sensitive element for the measurement of magnetic fields. While the mainstream of magnetometers based on NV centers uses so-called optically detected magnetic resonance, there has recently been a suggestion to use dispersive readout of a dielectric cavity to enhance the sensitivity of magnetometers. Here, we demonstrate that the dispersive readout approach can be significantly improved if a two-channel scheme is considered.</description>

      <title>Long-wavelength UV-LEDs and charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the charge management system in gravitational wave detection missions, a continuous discharge strategy is considered by continuously illuminating a test mass (TM) with weak light in such a way to strike a balance between the charging and discharging rates and at the same time avoids the requirement for frequent activation of charge measurements. Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system.</description>

      <title>Spin-Texture Spin-valve with a van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We implement in particular a time synchronization protocol based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the smartphone clock synchronisation of 60 microseconds. Using two test cases in realistic outdoor conditions, we eventually prove the reliability of a smartphone fleet to measure mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.</description>

      <title>Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

      <title>From real-time calibrations to smart HV tuning for FAIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.</description>

      <title>GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\,\mu\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\,\mu\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\,\mu\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\,\mu\text{m}$.
  Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.</description>

      <title>Calibration Plan for the SBC 10-kg Liquid Argon Detector with 100 eV Target Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Event Reconstruction in the CMS Phase-2 High Granularity Calorimeter Endcap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity era of the LHC will offer greatly increased number of events for more precise Standard Model measurements and Beyond Standard Model searches, but will also pose unprecedented challenges to the detectors. To meet these challenges, the CMS detector will undergo several upgrades, including the replacement of the current endcap calorimeters with a novel High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL). To make optimal use of this innovative detector, new and original algorithms are being devised. A dedicated reconstruction framework, The Iterative Clustering (TICL), is being developed within the CMS Software (CMSSW). This new framework is designed to fully exploit the high spatial resolution and precise timing information provided by HGCAL. Several key ingredients of the object reconstruction chain already rely on Machine Learning (ML) techniques and their usage is expected to further develop in the future. The existing reconstruction strategies will be presented stressing the role played by ML techniques to exploit the information provided by the detector. The areas where ML techniques are expected to play a role in the future developments will be also discussed.</description>

      <title>A synchronization-free one-way ranging observable for detecting and characterizing coherent orbital-period systematics in GRACE-FO laser ranging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.</description>
