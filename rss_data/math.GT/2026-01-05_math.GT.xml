      <title>The link surgery modules of 2-component L-space links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work, we studied the link surgery modules of two component L-space links. Therein, we computed two of the four idempotents of such modules. In this article, we use Koszul duality to give an alternate account of this proof, and also to extend it to compute the entire link surgery modules of such links, modulo a technical result which will be proven in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Anosov triangle reflection groups in SL(3,R)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify all Anosov representations of compact hyperbolic triangle reflection groups into the higher rank Lie group $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$. Specifically, we prove that such a representation is Anosov if and only if either it lies in the Hitchin component of the representation space, or it lies in the "Barbot component" and the product of the three generators of the triangle group has distinct real eigenvalues. Unlike representations in the Hitchin component, Anosov representations in the Barbot component have non-convex boundary maps.</description>

      <title>SU(2) representations and a large surgery formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A knot $K\subset S^3$ is called $SU(2)$-abundant if it satisfies two conditions: first, for all but finitely many $r\in\mathbb{Q}\backslash\{0\}$, there exists an irreducible representation $\pi_1(S^3_r(K))\to SU(2)$; second, any slope $r=u/v\neq 0$ for which $S^3_r(K)$ admits no irreducible $SU(2)$ representation must satisfy $\Delta_K(\zeta^2)= 0$ for some $u$-th root of unity $\zeta$. We show that if a nontrivial knot $K\subset S^3$ is not $SU(2)$-abundant then it is a prime knot whose Alexander polynomial $\Delta_K(t)$ has coefficients restricted to $\{-1,0,1\}$. This implies, in particular, that all hyperbolic alternating knots are $SU(2)$-abundant. Our proof hinges on a large surgery formula connecting instanton knot homology $KHI(S^3,K)$ and framed instanton homology $I^\sharp(S^3_n(K))$ for integers $n$ satisfying $|n|\ge 2g(K)+1$. Using this technique, we derive several interesting results in instanton Floer homology: for any Berge knot $K$, the spaces $KHI(S^3,K)$ and $\widehat{HFK}(S^3,K)$ have identical dimension; for any dual knot $K_r\subset S^3_r(K)$ of a Berge knot $K$ with $r&gt; 2g(K)-1$, we prove $\dim_\mathbb{C}KHI(S^3_r(K),K_r)=|H_1(S^3_r(K);\mathbb{Z})|$; and for any genus-one alternating knot $K$ and any $r\in\mathbb{Q}\backslash\{0\}$, the spaces $I^\sharp(S^3_r(K))$ and $\widehat{HF}(S_r^3(K))$ have equal dimension.</description>

      <title>Guts of nearly fibered knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The guts of a knot is an invariant defined for the knot complement by Agol-Zhang. Nearly fibered knots, which are defined as knots whose Floer homology has dimension two in the top Alexander grading, were introduced by Baldwin-Sivek. In this note, we provide three models for the guts of nearly fibered knots in the $3$-sphere. As a corollary, the nearly fibered condition can be purely topologically characterized and is independent of the specific version of Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Diameter of a new model of random hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of random surfaces, especially in the asymptotics of large genus, has been of increasing interest in recent years. Many geometrical questions have analogous formulations in the theory of random graphs with a large number of vertices, and results obtained in one area can inspire the other. In this paper, we are interested in the diameter of random surfaces, a basic measure of the connectivity of the surface. We introduce a new class of models of random surfaces built from random graphs and we compute the asymptotics of the diameter of these surfaces, which is logarithmic in the genus of the surface. The strategy of the proof relies on a detailed study of an exploration process which is the analogue of the breadth-first search exploration of a random graph. Its analysis is based on subadditive and concentration techniques.</description>

      <title>2-torsion in instanton Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of $2$-torsion in instanton Floer homology with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients for closed $3$-manifolds and singular knots. First, we show that the non-existence of $2$-torsion in the framed instanton Floer homology $I^\sharp(S_n^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ of any nonzero integral $n$-surgery along a knot $K$ in $S^3$ would imply that $K$ is fibered. Also, we show that $I^\sharp(S_{r}^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ for any nontrivial $K$ with $r=1,1/2,1/4$ always has $2$-torsion. These two results indicate that the existence of $2$-torsion is expected to be a generic phenomenon for Dehn surgeries along knots. Second, we show that for genus-one knots with nontrivial Alexander polynomials and for unknotting-number-one knots, the unreduced singular instanton knot homology $I^\sharp(S^3,K;\mathbb{Z})$ always has $2$-torsion. Finally, some crucial lemmas that help us demonstrate the existence of $2$-torsion are motivated by analogous results in Heegaard Floer theory, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we show that, for a knot $K$ in $S^3$, if there is a nonzero rational number $r$ such that the dual knot $\widetilde{K}_r$ inside $S^3_r(K)$ is Floer simple, then $S^3_r(K)$ must be an L-space and $K$ must be an L-space knot.</description>

      <title>Lifting closed curves to finite covers of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show that given any integer $l\geq 2$, every closed curve $\gamma$ on the bouquet of $n$-circles $\Gamma$, admits a lift to a finite $l$-sheeted normal covering of $\Gamma$. Equivalently, identifying the free group $F_n$ of $n$ generators with the fundamental group of $\Gamma$, this statement asserts that $F_n$ is a union of $ l$-index normal subgroups for any $l\geq 2.$ The proof proceeds by explicitly constructing families of $l$-sheeted normal coverings of $\Gamma$, together with a characterization, in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, of when a closed curve $\gamma$ on $\Gamma$ lifts to these covers.</description>

      <title>Braiding vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study what we believe is an intriguing and, to the best of our knowledge, previously unknown connection between two areas in computational topology, topological data analysis (TDA) and knot theory. Given a function from a topological space to $\mathbb{R}$, TDA provides tools to simplify and study the importance of topological features: in particular, the $l^{th}$-dimensional persistence diagram encodes the $l$-homology in the sublevel set as the function value increases as a set of points in the plane. Given a continuous one-parameter family of such functions, we can combine the persistence diagrams into an object known as a vineyard, which track the evolution of points in the persistence diagram. If we further restrict that family of functions to be periodic, we identify the two ends of the vineyard, yielding a closed vineyard. This allows the study of monodromy, which in this context means that following the family of functions for a period permutes the set of points in a non-trivial way. In this work, given a link and value $l$, we construct a topological space and periodic family of functions such that the closed $l$-vineyard contains this link. This shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as one could possibly hope. Importantly, it has at least two immediate consequences: First, monodromy of any periodicity can occur in a $l$-vineyard, answering a variant of a question by [Arya et al 2024]. To exhibit this, we also reformulate monodromy in a more geometric way, which may be of interest in itself. Second, distinguishing vineyards is likely to be difficult given the known difficulty of knot and link recognition, which have strong connections to many NP-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Stability phenomena in Deligne--Mumford compactifications via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rational homology of the Deligne--Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of stable curves via a family of Morse functions, namely the $\text{sys}_T$ functions. Exploiting the geometric and Morse properties of $\text{sys}_T$, including the existence of an index gap and additivity of the Morse index upon gluing maps, we reprove that in low degrees the homology of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ is supported entirely on the boundary $\partial \overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$, providing a geometric perspective complementary to Harer's classical result on the virtual cohomological dimension.
  Furthermore, we establish finite generation and stability phenomena for the rational homology across all genera and numbers of marked points. We show that for each degree $k$, a finite set of homology elements generates all $k$-th homology classes via attaching copies of thrice-marked $\mathbb{P}^1$. This result also recovers previously known stability in the number of marked points, such as Tosteson's theorem.</description>
