      <title>NuSTAR Observation of the TeV-Detected Radio Galaxy 3C 264: Core Emission and the Hot Accretion Flow Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 264 is one of the few FRI radio galaxies with detected TeV emission. It is a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and is generally associated with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Earlier multiwavelength studies suggest that the X-ray emission originates from a jet. However, the possibility that the RIAF can significantly contribute to the X-rays cannot be ruled out. In particular, hard X-ray emission $\gtrsim$10 keV has never been detected, making it challenging to distinguish between X-ray models. Here we report a NuSTAR detection up to 25 keV from 3C 264. We also present subpixel deconvolved Chandra images to resolve jet emission down to ~0.2 arcsec from the center of the unresolved X-ray core. Together with a simultaneous Swift observation, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. We found evidence of a cutoff in the energy around 20 keV, indicating that at least some of the X-rays from the core can be attributed to the RIAF. The Comptonization model suggests an electron temperature of about 15 keV and an optical depth ranging between 4 and 7, following the universality of coronal properties of black hole accretion. The cutoff energy or electron temperature of 3C 264 is the lowest among those of other LLAGNs. The detected hard X-ray emission is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by synchrotron self-Compton models introduced to explain $\gamma$-ray and TeV emission, suggesting that the synchrotron electrons might be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interaction in White Dwarf Binaries as Mechanism for Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing population of long-period radio transients has been discovered and their physical origin is still up to debate. Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101 + 5521 was discovered, which is in a white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 min period being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission phase coinciding with the conjunction configuration when the MD is at the far end. We suggest that the radio emission properties of the system can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between the magnetized WD and the MD with low magnetization, with the electron cyclotron maser being the most likely radiation mechanism. This mechanism is similar to that of Jupiter decametric emission due to Jupiter-Io interaction. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long period sub-population.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flare GRB 231115A: Insights from Fermi/GBM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection and analysis of GRB 231115A, a candidate extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) observed by Fermi/GBM and localized by INTEGRAL to the starburst galaxy M82. This burst exhibits distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics that align with known MGFs, including a short duration and a high peak energy. Gamma-ray analyses reveal significant insights into this burst, supporting conclusions already established in the literature: our time-resolved spectral studies provide further evidence that GRB 231115A is indeed a MGF. Significance calculations also suggest a robust association with M82, further supported by a high Bayes factor that minimizes the probability of chance alignment with a neutron star merger. Despite extensive follow-up efforts, no contemporaneous gravitational wave or radio emissions were detected. The lack of radio emission sets stringent upper limits on possible radio luminosity. Constraints from our analysis show no fast radio bursts (FRBs) associated with two MGFs. X-ray observations conducted post-burst by Swift/XRT and XMM/Newton provided additional data, though no persistent counterparts were identified. Our study underscores the importance of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up and highlights the potential of MGFs to enhance our understanding of short GRBs and magnetar activities in the cosmos. Current MGF identification and follow-up implementation are insufficient for detecting expected counterparts; however, improvements in these areas may allow for the recovery of follow-up signals with existing instruments. Future advancements in observational technologies and methodologies will be crucial in furthering these studies.</description>

      <title>Validation of straight-line signal propagation for radio signal of very inclined cosmic ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural non-uniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. This while the refraction due to a non-uniform atmosphere is expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction that is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of assuming straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end-point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find that including ray curvature effects into the end-point formalism calculation introduces changes of up to a few percent in fluence for frequencies up to 1.2 GHz and zenith angles up to 88{\deg}.</description>

      <title>On the Broadening of the Characteristic Frequency Range towards Higher Photon Energies in the X-ray Variability of the Black Hole Transient MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-dependence of X-ray Fourier power spectral states and the characteristic frequencies of the Band-Limited Noise (BLN) components have been seen in the hard state and intermediate states of black hole X-ray binaries. Here we report our analysis of the \emph{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black hole transient MAXI J1820$+$070 during its 2018 outburst when the source was brightest in hard X-rays. We found opposite trends of the low-frequency ($&lt;$ 0.1 Hz) and the high-frequency ($&gt;$ 10 Hz) BLN components, i.e., decreasing vs. increasing in frequency with increasing photon energy up to beyond 200 keV, respectively. This establishes an apparent two-way broadening of the power plateau formed by multiple BLNs in the power spectra towards higher photon energies. The trend of increasing characteristic frequency of the highest BLN component with increasing photon energy has been interpreted as due to that the corresponding seed photons which are up-scatted to relatively higher energies originate in a region relatively more central in the corona previously. Following the same framework, the decreasing trend of the characteristic frequency of the low-frequency BLN component with increasing photon energy can be interpreted as due to that the corresponding seed photons which are up-scattered to higher photon energies originate from further out in the disk flow but on the opposite side of the central corona as to the observer. The opposite trends then implies that the the plateau in the power spectra formed by the multiple BLNs represents the radial extension of the accretion disk that contributes seed photons which produce the observed BLNs; the higher the photon energy is, the wider the power plateau and the smaller the fractional variability are, probably approaching to a Power-Law Noise (PLN) seen in the soft state.</description>

      <title>Discovery of young, oxygen-rich supernova remnants in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the late stages of supernovae before their merging into the surrounding medium. Oxygen-rich supernova remnants represent a rare subtype with strong visible light oxygen emission. Aims. We present a new method to detect SNRs exploiting the capabilities of modern visible-light integral-field units based on the shapes of the SNR emission lines. Methods. We search for unresolved shocked regions with broadened emission lines using the medium-resolution integral-field spectrograph MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. The spectral resolving power allows shocked emission sources to be differentiated from photoionised sources based on the linewidths. Results. We find 307 supernova remnants, including seven O-rich SNRs. For all O-rich SNRs, we observe the [O III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emission doublet. In addition, we observe emissions from [O I]{\lambda}{\lambda}6300,6364, [O II]{\lambda}{\lambda}7320,7330, H{\alpha}+[N II]{\lambda}6583 and [S II]{\lambda}{\lambda}6717,6731 to varying degrees. The linewidths for the O-rich SNRs are generally broader than the rest of the SNRs in the sample of this article. The oxygen emission complexes are reminiscient of SNR 4449-1 and some long-lasting SNe. For the O-rich SNRs, we also search for counterparts in archival data of other telescopes; we detect X-ray and mid-IR counterparts for a number of remnants. Conclusions. We have shown efficacy of the method to detect SNRs presented in this article. In addition, the method is also effective in detecting the rare O-rich SNRs, doubling the sample size in the literature. The origin of O-rich SNRs and their link to specific SN types or environments is still unclear, but further work into this new sample will unquestionably help us shed light on these rare remnants.</description>

      <title>Are the shape and flux of X-ray reflection spectra in hard state consistent with an accretion disk reaching close to the black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed spectra from black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) typically consist of two primary components: multitemperature blackbody (BB) originating from the accretion disk in soft X-ray, and a power-law like component in hard X-ray due to Comptonization of soft photons by the hot corona. Illumination of the disk by the corona gives rise to another key component known as reflection. A fraction of the incident hard X-ray radiation is naturally absorbed and re-emitted as a BB at lower energies, referred to as reprocessed BB. For densities relevant to XRBs and typical ionization values, the reprocessed BB may become significant in the soft X-ray region and should be noticeable in the observed spectra as a consequence of reflection. The absence of any BB component in the low/hard state of BH XRB may not be consistent with reflection of high irradiating flux observed as power-law from appropriately dense disk of XRB. We focus on the low/hard state of the BH XRB MAXI J1820+070. We simultaneously fit the shape and flux of the reflection spectra, allowing us to estimate the correct density and ionization of the slab and, correspondingly, the reprocessed BB. Our fitting suggests that the disk in principle may extend close to the BH and still the reprocessed BB due to disk illumination remains small enough to be consistent with the data as opposed to earlier study. The inner reflection component is highly ionized and its fit is primarily driven by its contribution to the continuum. The reprocessed BB cannot resolve whether the disk is extended close to the BH or not in the hard state. For this specific observation, the flux in inner reflection component turns out to be quite low with respect to outer reflection or power-law. Outflowing slab corona covering the inner region of the disk could be the possible geometry of the source with the underlying disk reaching close to the BH. (shortened)</description>

      <title>The Role of High-mass Stellar Binaries in the Formation of High-mass Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (&gt;=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. Furthermore, we study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers as a function of fb_15_prime.</description>

      <title>Testing No slip model with pulsar timing arrays: NANOGrav and IPTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an observational study of modified gravity considering a potential inflationary interpretation of pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We use a motivated model known as no slip in which the gravitational wave propagation is modified. Specifically, by using two different parametrizations for the model, we find the approximate transfer functions for tensor perturbations. In this way, we obtain the spectral energy density of gravitational waves and use NANOGrav and IPTA second data release to constrain parameters of the model. We find that there is degeneracy between the model parameters $\xi$ and $c_M$. For $c_M$, we only get an upper bound on the parameter. Thus, it is difficult to constrain them with percent level accuracy with the current PTA data.</description>

      <title>Probing the high frequency variability of NGC 5044: the key to AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) high frequency observations of NGC5044 to assess the time variability of the mm-waveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau ~1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.</description>

      <title>A potential mass-gap black hole in a wide binary with a circular orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower mass black holes. Although recent LIGO observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be noninteracting without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report Gaia DR3 3425577610762832384, a wide binary system including a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial velocity measurements from LAMOST and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogs, we determine a mass of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ of the unseen component. This places the unseen companion within the mass gap, strongly suggesting the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.</description>

Abstract: This paper argues that repeating and apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts are distinct classes of events produced by distinct classes of sources. I review the evidence for that division, and then discusses the statistics of these classes. They differ in temporal/spectral space, spectral/duration space and rotation measure; the first two differences indicate different environments. I discuss two of the many models of each class of source: black hole accretion discs for repeating FRB and hypermagnetized neutron stars (some observed to produce SGR) for apparently non-repeating FRB. Appendices suggest low cutoff frequencies of coherent emission that are consistent with these models and with known pulsars, and discuss the necessary conditions for acceleration of energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Prospects for AGN Studies with AXIS: AGN Fueling -- Resolving Hot Gas inside Bondi Radius of SMBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot gas around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) should be captured within the gravitational "sphere of influence", characterized by the Bondi radius. Deep Chandra observations have spatially resolved the Bondi radii of five nearby SMBHs that are believed to be accreting in hot accretion mode. Contrary to earlier hot accretion models that predicted a steep temperature increase within the Bondi radius, none of the resolved temperature profiles exhibit such an increase. The temperature inside the Bondi radius appears to be complex, indicative of a multi-temperature phase of hot gas with a cooler component at about 0.2-0.3 keV. The density profiles within the Bondi regions are shallow, suggesting the presence of strong outflows. These findings might be explained by recent realistic numerical simulations that suggest that large-scale accretion inside the Bondi radius can be chaotic, with cooler gas raining down in some directions and hotter gas outflowing in others. With an angular resolution similar to Chandra and a significantly larger collecting area, AXIS will collect enough photons to map the emerging accretion flow within and around the "sphere of influence" of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AXIS will reveal transitions in the inflow that ultimately fuels the AGN, as well as outflows that provide feedback to the environment.</description>

      <title>Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars: Impacts of Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars have been well studied since they may be relevant to the physical interpretation of some of the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the magnetar giant flares. In the crustal region of a magnetar, the strong magnetic field can alter the equation of state and composition due to the Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion. In this paper, we study this effect on the crust-confined, torsional oscillation modes of neutron stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields in general relativity under the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, the inner and outer crusts are treated consistently based on the nuclear-energy density functional theory. Depending on the magnetic-field configurations, we find that the Landau-Rabi quantization of electrons can change the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillation mode of $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star models with a normal fluid core by about 10\% when the magnetic field strength at the pole reaches the order of $10^{16}$ G. The shift can even approach 20\% at a field strength of $10^{15}$ G for neutron stars with a simple model of superconducting core where the magnetic field is assumed to be expelled completely.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Forces with Multimessenger Studies of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.</description>

      <title>Flares from plasmoids and current sheets around Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of our galaxy produces repeating near-infrared flares that are observed by ground and space based instruments. This activity has been simulated in the past with Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) models which include stable jet formations. The present study uses a different approach in that it considers a Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) multi-loop model that lacks a stable jet structure. The main objective of this research is to identify regions that contain current sheets and high magnetic turbulence, and to subsequently generate a 2.2 micron light curve generated from non-thermal particles. Additionally, we investigate the properties of the flares, in particular, their evolution during flare events, and the similarity of flare characteristics between the generated and observed light curves. 2D GRMHD simulation data from a SANE multi-loop model is employed, and thermal radiation is introduced to generate a 230 GHz light curve. Physical variables are calibrated to align with the 230 GHz observations. Current sheets are identified by analyzing toroidal currents, magnetization, plasma beta, density, and dimensionless temperatures. The evolution of current sheets during flare events is studied, and higher-energy non-thermal light curves are calculated, focusing on the 2.2 micron near-infrared range. We obtain promising 2.2 micron light curves whose flare duration and spectral index behavior align well with observations. Our findings support the association of flares with particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in current sheet plasmoid chains and in the boundary of the disk inside the funnel above and below the central black hole.</description>

      <title>3D hybrid fluid-particle jet simulations and the importance of synchrotron radiative losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei are known for their exceptional energy output, and imaging the synthetic synchrotron emission of numerical jet simulations is essential for a comparison with observed jet polarization emission. Aims. Through the use of 3D hybrid fluid-particle jet simulations (with the PLUTO code), we overcome some of the commonly made assumptions in relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations by using non-thermal particle attributes to account for the resulting synchrotron radiation. Polarized radiative transfer and ray-tracing (via the RADMC-3D code) highlight the differences in total intensity maps when (i) the jet is simulated purely with the RMHD approach, (ii) a jet tracer is considered in the RMHD approach, and (iii) a hybrid fluid-particle approach is used. The resulting emission maps were compared to the example of the radio galaxy Centaurus A. Methods. We applied the Lagrangian particle module implemented in the latest version of the PLUTO code. This new module contains a state-of-the-art algorithm for modeling diffusive shock acceleration and for accounting for radiative losses in RMHD jet simulations. The module implements the physical postulates missing in RMHD jet simulations by accounting for a cooled ambient medium and strengthening the central jet emission. Results. We find a distinction between the innermost structure of the jet and the back-flowing material by mimicking the radio emission of the Seyfert II radio galaxy Centaurus A when considering an edge-brightened jet with an underlying purely toroidal magnetic field. We demonstrate the necessity of synchrotron cooling as well as the improvements gained when directly accounting for non-thermal synchrotron radiation via non-thermal particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalarization is a mechanism that endows strongly self-gravitating bodies, such as neutron stars and black holes, with a scalar-field configuration. It resembles a phase transition in that the scalar configuration appears only when a certain quantity that characterizes the compact object, for example, its compactness or spin, is beyond a threshold. A critical and comprehensive review of scalarization, including the mechanism itself, theories that exhibit it, its manifestation in neutron stars, black holes and their binaries, potential extension to other fields, and a thorough discussion of future perspectives, is provided.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Waveform Model for Detecting Accelerating Inspiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04175v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic frequency-domain gravitational waveform model for an inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.</description>

      <title>Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Host Double Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become one of the leading contenders to explain most Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs &lt; 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD &lt; 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Flashes on Helium Novae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates of $(1.6-7.5) \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD.</description>

      <title>Application of Kaluza-Klein Theory in Modeling Compact Stars: Exploring Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>
