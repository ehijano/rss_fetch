      <title>Bayesian Persuasion with Selective Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sender first publicly commits to an experiment and then can privately run additional experiments and selectively disclose their outcomes to a receiver. The sender has private information about the maximal number of additional experiments they can perform (i.e., their type). We show that the sender cannot attain their commitment payoff in any equilibrium if (i) the receiver is sufficiently uncertain about their type and (ii) the sender could benefit from selective disclosure after conducting their full-commitment optimal experiment. Otherwise, there can be equilibria where the sender obtains their commitment payoff.</description>

      <title>Game connectivity and adaptive dynamics in many-action games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the typical structure of games in terms of their connectivity properties. A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-\zeta_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $\zeta_n&gt;0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $\zeta_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle. We thus complement our previous work to provide a more complete picture of game connectivity across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, are increasingly able to mimic individual personalities. These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search for matches in contexts ranging from marriage to employment. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI representations and their imperfect representation of humans. An individual's personality is modeled as a point in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and an individual's AI representation is modeled as a noisy approximation of that personality. I compare two search regimes: Under in person search, each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them; under AI-mediated search, individuals match to the person with the most compatible AI representation. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters yields a better expected match than search over infinite AI representations. Moreover, when personality is sufficiently high-dimensional, simply meeting two people in person is more effective than search on an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Contract Design with Deferred Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a robust contract design problem with deferred inspection, in which a principal allocates a scarce resource to an agent, observes the agent's realized outcome ex post at negligible cost, and conditions transfers on this information through rewards. The principal faces ambiguity about the agent's value distribution and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue subject to incentive compatibility and limited liability. In contrast to existing work on inspection mechanisms, which relies on common-prior assumptions, we adopt a distributionally robust approach based on moment information. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the robust contract design problem with a single agent. When the ambiguity set is defined by the first moment, we identify a robustly optimal contract with a concave allocation rule and a linear payment rule. We further show that robustness does not uniquely pin down transfers: we construct a Pareto robustly optimal contract that preserves the same allocation while extracting maximal feasible payments from all types, yielding strictly higher expected revenue under non-worst-case distributions. We also derive structural results for multi-agent extensions. For ambiguity sets defined by the first $N$ moments, we show that robust optimality requires aggregate payments to be lower bounded by a multi-dimensional polynomial of degree $N$. However, unlike the single-agent case, robust multi-agent mechanisms are substantially more complex: dominant-strategy incentive compatibility becomes necessary, simple monotone mechanisms are no longer tractable, and worst-case distributions may involve correlated types or degenerate to a Dirac distribution at the mean. These results highlight a sharp contrast between robust contract design and robust multi-agent mechanism design with inspection.</description>

      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>
