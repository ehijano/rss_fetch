      <title>Universality of $SU(\infty)$ relaxation dynamics for $SU(n_f)$-symmetric spin-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-models, where the $N$ spins interact pairwise with a $SU(n_f)$ symmetry preserving hamiltonian, famously simplify in the large $n_f$, $N$ limits, as derived by Sachdev and Ye when exploring mean-field behavior of spin-glasses. We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric RG flow to lower-dimensional effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an asymmetric RG flow from a $d$-dimensional UV CFT to a lower-dimensional IR CFT. The asymptotic geometry of a $(d+1)$-dimensional AdS charged black hole is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional AdS space while its near horizon geometry is reduced to AdS$_2 \times \Sigma_{d-1}$. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the dual field theory describes an RG flow from a $d$-dimensional CFT to IR QFT defined in $R_t \times \Sigma_{d-1}$. We show that one-dimensional conformal quantum mechanics can effectively describe the IR QFT due to the rapid suppression of the correlation in the $\Sigma_{d-1}$ sector. In this case, the IR conformal dimension crucially relies on the blackening factor, which on the dual QFT side is associated with the matter's density. We further study an asymmetric RG flow from a four-dimensional UV CFT to a two-dimensional IR CFT by turning on an external magnetic field, which leads to a localization in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Leading soft theorems on plane wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization group for Higgs-like models in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently defined a model of 2 coupled SU(2) Higgs doublets which revealed an interesting structure of renormalization group flows to 1-loop when the SU(2) is broken to U(1). In this article we compute the beta functions to 3 loops and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders. For SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The flows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g \to 1/g$. One finds a line of fixed points which are new conformal field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions which are non-unitary due to negative norm states but still have real eigenvalues. We also find massless flows between 2 non-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow. For the flows between points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the perturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where anomalous dimensions are rational numbers. The model is non-unitary since the hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger$. The unitary operator ${\cal K}$ satisfies ${\cal K}^2 =1$ and this allows a projection onto positive norm states with a unitary time evolution with positive probabilities.</description>

      <title>Tropical sampling from Feynman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.</description>

      <title>The linear relations between the complex moduli and using the linear relations reduce the stabilization equations for supersymmetric black holes in N=2 theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. D 54, 6293 (1996)], the black hole entropy was derived by solving the matrix equation obtained from the stabilization equations for the solution of frozen moduli. In this paper, by directly solving the stabilization equations for the solution of frozen moduli without using the matrix equation, we find linear relations between any two of the three complex moduli at the black hole horizon. So far, no one discusses the linear relations. Via the linear relations, we derive the unique solution of frozen moduli and reduce the stabilization equations in three different ways. For example, the eight stabilization equations in [Phys. Rev. D 54, 6293 (1996)] can be replaced equivalently with three equations: the solution of moduli z1 and two linear relations, which are much simpler and more intuitive.</description>

      <title>Coupling Selection Rules in Heterotic Calabi-Yau Compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coupling selection rules of chiral matter fields in heterotic string theory with standard embedding. These selection rules are determined by topological properties of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We classify coupling selection rules on complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. It is found that all of these selection rules for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$ are understood by combinations of only five types of fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Dynamically assisted Klein tunneling in the Furry picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory, where the oscillating electric field is treated as a perturbation. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.</description>

      <title>The gravitational index of a small black ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain supersymmetric elementary string states with angular momentum can be viewed as small black rings in a five-dimensional string theory. These black rings have zero area event horizon. The 4D-5D connection relates these small rings to small black holes without angular momentum in one less dimension. Recent works have proposed saddle solutions that compute the supersymmetric index for small black holes using gravitational path integral. In this paper, we propose an analogous saddle solution for a five-dimensional small black ring. The dominant contribution comes from a black ring saddle that rotates in both independent planes in five dimensions and has a finite area event horizon. We also write the saddle solution as a three-center Bena-Warner solution.</description>

      <title>BSFT-like action from cohomomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By performing a field redefinition via a cohomomorphism on the Maurer-Cartan action of the $A_\infty$ algebra, we construct an action that reproduces the characteristic structure of boundary string field theory (BSFT), which we refer to as the BSFT-like action. We show that the form and several properties of this BSFT-like action closely resemble those of BSFT. Our results suggest that this approach provides a systematic framework to derive the BSFT action from the OSFT based on $A_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reduced density matrices obtained for the quantum states in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SU(2) and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The reduced density matrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of the total system. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduced density matrices are monic polynomials with rational coefficients.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat Kernel Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize functional determinants in up to 13 dimensions. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the heat kernel methods to the first-order formalism of gravity, specifically, in the language of differential forms. This allows us to compute the effective dynamics of 4D gravity when the tetrad degrees of freedom are integrated out. We show that the resulting effective field theory is the Lorentz gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Axion Mixing in the String Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string axiverse presents a fascinating and complex landscape for axion physics. In this work, we study axion mass mixing within the type IIB string axiverse, focusing specifically on the LARGE volume scenario (LVS) axiverse. The LVS axiverse necessitates at least two axions to ensure the presence of both a QCD axion candidate and at least one additional axion-like particle (ALP). This study presents the first systematic exploration of axion mass mixing in scenarios involving more than two axions. The maximal mixing occurs when the masses of all ALPs are smaller than the zero-temperature mass of the QCD axion, with no two ALP masses being equal, and when the decay constants of all ALPs are simultaneously either smaller or larger than the decay constant of the QCD axion. Additionally, the transfer of axion energy density ultimately takes place only between the two axions with the closest masses. These findings provide critical insights into axion dynamics not only within type IIB string axiverse models but also in broader multi-axion mixing frameworks. The potential cosmological implications of axion mass mixing are also addressed at the end. Our work contributes to the understanding of axion physics in string theory.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Singularities from Holographic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>

      <title>Towards a Flat Space Carrollian Hologram from AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a concrete example holography in four dimensional asymptotically flat space is an important open problem. A natural strategy is to take the flat space limit of the celebrated AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ correspondence, which relates M-theory in AdS$_4 \times$S$^7$ to a certain superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theory known as the ABJM theory. In this limit, the boundary of AdS$_4$ becomes null infinity and the ABJM theory should exhibit an emergent superconformal Carrollian symmetry. We investigate this possiblity by matching the Carrollian limit of ABJM correlators with four-dimensional supergravity amplitudes that arise from taking the flat space limit of AdS$_4 \times$S$^7$ and reducing along the S$^7$. We also present a general analysis of three-dimensional superconformal Carrollian symmetry.</description>

      <title>Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. To do so, we establish an intrinsic gauge-fixing procedure for the geometric data, which allows us to derive the extended BMS symmetries and the correct transformation law of the shear, encoded in the connection. Our analysis reveals that the invariant Lagrangians are always topological, thereby reducing the 4d bulk to a 2d boundary theory. Moreover, we find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. This BMS field theory is dual to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes when the superrotation anomalies coincide and are dictated by the bulk. Meanwhile, the absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory, intrinsic and independent of bulk considerations, offering further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant gluon-graviton scattering in AdS at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mixed gluon-graviton scattering in Type IIB string theory on AdS$_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the presence of D7 branes, which is dual to a mixed correlator of the $SO(8)$ and $SU(2)_L$ flavor multiplets of a certain 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $USp(2N)$ gauge theory with complexified coupling $\tau$. We compute this holographic correlator in the large $N$ and finite $\tau$ expansion using constraints from derivatives of the mass deformed sphere free energy, which we compute using supersymmetric localization at large $N$ and finite $\tau$ in terms of modular invariant non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. In particular, we combine this constraint with the known flat space limit to fix the $R^2F^2$ higher derivative correction to the correlator in terms of the weight one non-holomorphic Eisenstein series, and also to fix the logarithmic threshold. We also compute the one-loop correction to the correlator, and match it to the expected flat space limit result.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\bar{T}$ Deformations On Causal Self-Dual Electrodynamics Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-dual condition, which ensures invariance under electromagnetic duality, manifests as a partial differential equation in nonlinear electromagnetism theories. The general solution to this equation is expressed in terms of an auxiliary field, $\tau$, and Courant-Hilbert functions, $\ell(\tau)$, which depend on $\tau$. Recent studies have shown that duality-invariant nonlinear electromagnetic theories fulfill the principle of causality under the conditions $\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \tau} \ge 1$ and $\frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial \tau^2} \ge 0$.
  In this paper, we investigate theories with two coupling constants that also comply with the principle of causality. We demonstrate that these theories possess a new universal representation of the root-$T\bar{T}$ operator. Additionally, we derive marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the logarithmic causal self-dual electrodynamics and identify a symmetry referred to as $\alpha$-symmetry, which is present in all these models.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05279v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of the gradient descent method, ensuring consistency across arbitrary coordinate systems and general curved trainable spaces. The optimization dynamics is defined using a covariant force vector and a covariant metric tensor, both computed from the first and second statistical moments of the gradients. These moments are estimated through time-averaging with an exponential weight function, which preserves linear computational complexity. We show that commonly used optimization methods such as RMSProp, Adam and AdaBelief correspond to special limits of the covariant gradient descent (CGD) and demonstrate how these methods can be further generalized and improved.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the particle production by the Nambu-Goldstone boson in the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario for large misalignment angles. Studying numerically the case of an arbitrary initial phase, we reproduce the cubic dependence on the initial value of the phase of baryon asymmetry in the case of small oscillations and present our results for an initial phase close to {\pi}. Our calculations indicate that there is a saturation of particle production as the initial phase approaches {\pi}. We also discuss the probability distribution of the baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical formulation of the Dirac oscillator within a non-Abelian gauge field. The Dirac equation, a fundamental equation in relativistic quantum mechanics, has been modified to include interactions with non-Abelian gauge fields governed by Lie groups, such as SU(2). This theoretical framework aims to capture the complex quantum dynamics arising from these interactions.
  We derive the interaction terms and provide a comprehensive description of the modified Dirac oscillator by integrating concepts from both Abelian and non-Abelian interactions. The primary contributions of this work include introducing additional interaction terms in the Hamiltonian and formulating non-Abelian electromagnetic tensors. These findings pave the way for exploring quantum systems influenced by non-Abelian gauge fields, with potential applications in quantum field theory and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>An index for unitarizable $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "superconformal index" is a character-valued invariant attached by theoretical physics to unitary representations of Lie superalgebras, such as $\mathfrak{su}(2,2\vert n)$, that govern certain quantum field theories. The index can be calculated as a supertrace over Hilbert space, and is constant in families induced by variation of physical parameters. This is because the index receives contributions only from "short" irreducible representations such that it is invariant under recombination at the boundary of the region of unitarity.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop these notions for unitarizable supermodules over the special linear Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$ with $m\ge 2$, $n\ge 1$. To keep it self-contained, we include a fair amount of background material on structure theory, unitarizable supermodules, the Duflo-Serganova functor, and elements of Harish-Chandra theory. Along the way, we provide a precise dictionary between various notions from theoretical physics and mathematical terminology. Our final result is a kind of "index theorem" that relates the counting of atypical constituents in a general unitarizable $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodule to the character-valued $Q$-Witten index, expressed as a supertrace over the full supermodule. The formal superdimension of holomorphic discrete series $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodules can also be formulated in this framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Event shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlation measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime: a general analysis of Palatini theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive theoretical framework within the most general second-order Palatini theory to systematically analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves, providing robust support for using gravitational wave detectors to test and refine gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Imprints of extra dimensions in eccentric EMRI gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies regarding extra-dimensions have been of great interest in modern theoretical physics, including their observational consequences from future gravitational wave (GW) observatories. In this direction, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRI), attracting considerable interest in GW astronomy and fundamental physics, can potentially provide a useful platform for the search of extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine a rotating braneworld black hole in the context of equatorial eccentric EMRI and attempt to provide an order of magnitude analysis for the extra-dimensional parameter termed "tidal charge". We estimate GW fluxes for the dominant mode and determine the impact of the tidal charge parameter on the orbital evolution. We further evaluate the prospects of detecting such a parameter through mismatch computation. We observe a significant enhancement in the mismatch as the value of orbital eccentricity or tidal charge parameter increases; the phenomenon becomes more obvious for rapidly rotating massive black holes. Thus, the study suggests that eccentric EMRI can potentially probe the existence of extra dimensions with future low-frequency detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Prompt and non-prompt production of charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) based models to separate the prompt and non-prompt production of heavy flavour hadrons, such as $D^0$ and J/$\psi$, in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. For this purpose, we use PYTHIA~8 to generate events, which provides a good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements of charm hadron production. The input features for the ML models are experimentally measurable. The prediction accuracy of the ML models used in this study reaches up to 99\%. The ML models can be useful in providing precise track-level identification, which is not possible in experiments with traditional methods. The contribution also discusses future applications of the ML models to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt heavy quark hadrons.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel stochastic variational method (SVM) for quantizing non-relativistic spinless particles in curved spaces with torsion. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited for quantization in general coordinate systems and shows that torsion, typically associated with spin, can influence the quantum dynamics of spinless particles through quantum fluctuations. In a flat space, this torsion-induced effect appears as a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation, which is relevant to studies of solitons, wave function collapse, and possible modifications to conventional quantum mechanics. Since torsion arises in various modified gravity theories, particularly those related to the early universe and dark matter, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which such effects may impact quantum behavior. We also provide a rough estimate for the upper bound of the torsion magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement harvesting protocol within the context of cylindrical gravitational waves given first by Einstein and Rosen, focusing on the interactions between non-relativistic quantum systems and linearized quantum gravity. We study how two spatially separated detectors can extract entanglement from the specific spacetime in the presence of gravitational waves, which provides a precise quantification of the entanglement that can be harvested using these detectors. In particular, we obtain the relation between harvested entanglement and the distance to wave sources that emits gravitational waves and analyze the detectability using quantum Fisher information. The enhanced detectability demonstrates the advantages of cylindrical symmetric gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More and more excited baryons have been reported experimentally, but many properties are still unclear. This work attempts to simultaneously study the masses and strong decay widths of some singly heavy baryons, in order to provide possible quantum numbers for these states. The chiral quark model and the $^{3}P_{0}$ decay model are employed to calculate the masses and decay widths of $\Lambda_{c(b)}$ and $\Sigma_{c(b)}$ baryons for all quantum numbers with $2S$, $1P$, and $2P$ waves. We considered not only two-body strong decays but also the influence of three-body decays. Our calculations show that: (i) For states with experimentally determined quantum numbers, such as $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\Lambda_b(5912)$ and $\Lambda_b(5920)$, the results are consistent with experimental data and the conclusions of most theoretical studies. (ii) For states whose quantum numbers have not yet been fully determined experimentally, we provide possible interpretations. For example, our calculations tend to interpret $\Lambda_c(2910)$ is interpreted as a $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 1P-wave $\rho$-mode or a $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ state with 2P wave $\lambda$-mode. $\Lambda_c(2940)$ can be interpreted as the $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 2P-wave $\lambda$-mode. For $\Lambda_c(2860)$, we offer a different interpretation, proposing that its mass and width closely match those of a 2P-wave $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ state. It is hoped that our calculations can provide valuable information for the experimental and theoretical studies of heavy baryons.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation and match them with physical and real experiments.</description>

      <title>A parton shower consistent with parton densities at LO and NLO: PDF2ISR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining an initial-state parton shower model where the (backward) evolution fully consistent with the (forward) evolution of the collinear parton density used. As a proof-of-concept we use parton densities obtained with the Parton Branching (PB) approach, and modify the default initial-state shower in PYTHIA8 with this method to be consistent with them. PB is ideally suited for checking the validity of our method since, in addition to producing collinear parton densities, it also produces the corresponding transverse-dependent (TMD) ones, and these can then be directly compared to the transverse momentum distribution obtained from the parton shower. We show that TMD distributions which we in this way obtain from our modified PYTHIA8 shower using leading order (LO) parton densities and splitting functions are fully consistent with the corresponding leading order TMD densities. At next-to-leading order (NLO) it is not possible to achieve the same consistency using the built-in LO splitting functions in the shower, but we show that by introducing NLO splitting functions using a reweighting procedure, we can achieve consistency also at NLO. The method presented here, which we have named PDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinear parton densities, as long as the exact conditions for the evolution are known. With the PDF2ISR method we obtain an initial-state parton shower which in principle has no free parameters, and is fully consistent with collinear parton densities at LO and NLO.</description>

      <title>Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions and reconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et al., using the Wilson fermion formalism. These operators commute with the Hamiltonian and become the generators of vector and axial $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries in the continuum limit. An interesting feature of the axial charge operator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in momentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted as fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in the continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry. We construct a Hamiltonian using the eigenstates of the axial charge operator, preserving exact axial symmetry on the lattice and vector symmetry in the continuum. As applications, we examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism in the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models. Our formulation supports symmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges, although further numerical studies are required to verify the SMG mechanism in interacting models.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of asymptotic safety, we study quantum quadratic gravity in the presence of the Higgs field considered as non-separable from the vacuum. The theory flows to a high energy fixed point where the Higgs field is strongly coupled to gravity, its potential is symmetric, and the quadratic Weyl curvature coupling is large. The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable high mass resonance which renders unitarity in the spirit of Lee-Week type theories. Furthermore, if the scalar graviton is tachyonic then there will be a low energy fixed point where tachyonic condensation leads to a new stable vacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges, and the behavior of the Higgs field is classical (not influenced by gravitational interaction). Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadratic whereas at the Fermi scale it is linear, and in the intermediate region both contributions are relevant. Thus, at the Fermi scale the quadratic curvature fields disappear through the ghost instability and tachyon condensation, giving rise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime torsion source an extremely red-tilted cosmological GW background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, any generic $f(R)$ model of gravity is conformally dual to a scalar-tensor theory augmented with a second rank antisymmetric massless degree of freedom. We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second order by such a torsional field, treated perturbatively during an epoch of canonical, single-field, slow-roll inflation. The resulting second-order induced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at all scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies, and is found to be extremely red-tilted with an effective tensor spectral index $\alpha_{\rm T}\sim-6$ on matter-dominated scales. The signal is potentially within the reach of upcoming indirect GW probes on very large scales $k\lesssim10^{-2}\:\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, i.e., next-generation CMB experiments like the LiteBIRD. In the near future, observation of such a markedly red-tilted SGWB on CMB scales could hence provide a novel and unique clue in favour of torsional gravity during the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a black hole forms from a pure quantum state $\ket{\psi}$. The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting that, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and evaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region $\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <title>Comments on the holographic description of Narain theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic description of Narain $U(1)^c\times U(1)^c$ conformal field theories, and their potential similarity to conventional weakly coupled gravity in the bulk, in the sense that the effective IR bulk description includes "$U(1)$ gravity" amended with additional light degrees of freedom. Starting from this picture, we formulate the hypothesis that in the large central charge limit the density of states of any Narain theory is bounded by below by the density of states of $U(1)$ gravity. This immediately implies that the maximal value of the spectral gap for primary fields is $\Delta_1=c/(2\pi e)$. To test the self-consistency of this proposal, we study its implications using chiral lattice CFTs and CFTs based on quantum stabilizer codes. First we notice that the conjecture yields a new bound on quantum stabilizer codes, which is compatible with previously known bounds in the literature. We proceed to discuss the variance of the density of states, which for consistency must be vanishingly small in the large-$c$ limit. We consider ensembles of code and chiral theories and show that in both cases the density variance is exponentially small in the central charge.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Species Thermodynamics and the Black Hole - Tower Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species thermodynamics has been proposed in analogy to black hole thermodynamics. The entropy scales like an area and is given by the mere counting of the number of the species. In this work, we $\textit{derive}$ the constitutive relations of species thermodynamics and explain how those $\textit{originate}$ from standard thermodynamics. We consider configurations of species in thermal equilibrium inside a box of size $L$, and show that the temperature $T$ of the system, which plays a crucial role, is always upper bounded above by the species scale $\Lambda_{\rm sp}$. We highlight three relevant regimes: (i) when $L^{-1}&lt; T&lt;\Lambda_{\rm sp}$, and gravitational collapse is avoided, the system exhibits standard thermodynamics features, for example, with the entropy scaling like the volume of the box; (ii) in the limit $L^{-1}\simeq T\rightarrow \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ we recover the rules of species thermodynamics with the entropy scaling like the area of the box; (iii) an intermediate regime with $ L^{-1}\simeq T&lt; \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ that avoids gravitational collapse and fulfills the Covariant Entropy Bound; this interpolates between the previous two regimes and its entropy is given simply in terms of the counting of the species contributing to the thermodynamic ensemble. This study also allows us to find a novel and independent bottom-up rationale for the Emergent String Conjecture. Finally, we present the $\textit{Black Hole - Tower Correspondence}$ as a generalization of the celebrated Black Hole - String Correspondence. This provides us with a robust framework to interpret the results of our thermodynamic investigation. Moreover, it allows us to qualitatively account for the entropy of black holes in terms of the degrees of freedom of the weakly coupled species in the tower.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional Weyl double copy</title>

Abstract: The Weyl double copy (WDC) relation connects the Weyl tensor of the gravity theory and the field strength tensor of the Maxwell theory, which provides a concrete realization of the classical double copy. Although intensively investigated, the WDC is only limited in four-dimensional spacetime. In this Letter, we generalize the WDC relation to five-dimensional spacetime, which offers the first example of the WDC in higher dimensions. We show that a special class of five-dimensional type N vacuum solutions admits a special class of degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. The five-dimensional WDC relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the source-free Klein-Gordon equation on the curved background. We further verify that for five-dimensional pp-wave solution and Kundt solutions, the Maxwell fields and the scalar fields also satisfy the Maxwell's equations and the wave equation on five-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>The power of the anomaly consistency condition for the Master Ward Identity: Conservation of the non-Abelian gauge current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending local gauge tansformations in a suitable way to Faddeev-Popov ghost fields, one obtains a symmetry of the total action, i.e., the Yang-Mills action plus a gauge fixing term (in a lambda-gauge) plus the ghost action. The anomalous Master Ward Identity (for this action and this extended, local gauge transformation) states that the pertinent Noether current -- the interacting ``gauge current'' -- is conserved up to anomalies.
  It is proved that, apart from terms being easily removable (by finite renormalization), all possible anomalies are excluded by the consistency condition for the anomaly of the Master Ward Identity, recently derived in refenrence [8].</description>

Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons. Black hole solutions with a ring curvature singularity in between their inner and outer horizons are also presented.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Relativistic Quantum Information from Effective Field Theory Approach with Implications to Contextual Meanings of Locality and Quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work \cite{biggs2024comparing}, the effective field theory (EFT) is adopted to consider the quantum decoherence of a near-horizon Unrhu-DeWitt (UDW) charged qubit in a macroscopic cat state. We generalize this EFT approach to study the relativistic quantum information (RQI) of two static UDW-charged qubits with or without a black hole. This EFT is obtained by integrating out a massless mediator field, yielding the direct Coulombic interactions among intrinsic multipole moments of UDW detectors and the induced one on the black hole. The RQI of the quantum state of the mediator field can be probed by the reduced final states of UDW detectors by tracing out the induced internal states of the black hole. From the reduced final state, we find the patterns of entanglement harvesting agree with the ones obtained by the conventional approach based on master theory. However, the more detailed study suggests that the contextual meanings of (non-)locality may or may not be the same in quantum field theory (QFT) and RQI. To explore the contextual meanings of quantumness and locality more, we also calculate quantum discord and locality bound of the Bell-type experiments, with the former characterizing the non-classical correlations and the latter the (non-)locality in the hidden-variable context of RQI. We find that QFT and RQI agree on quantumness based on different physical reasons but may not agree on locality.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case, we consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct irregular representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra $\widehat{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$. We show how such irregular representations correspond to irregular Gaiotto-Teschner representations of the Virasoro algebra. The intertwiners for such representations satisfy a version of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations which we call irregular KZ equations. By connecting to 2d Liouville theory, we show how the conformal blocks governed by our irregular KZ equation correspond to 4d Argyres-Douglas theories with surface operator insertions. The corresponding flat connections describe braiding between such operators on the Gaiotto curve.</description>

Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter in the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed dark dimension scenario reveals that axions can be localized on the Standard Model brane, thereby predicting the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion decay constant from the Weak Gravity Conjecture: $f_a\lesssim M_5 \sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, where $M_5$ is the five-dimensional Planck mass. When combined with observational lower bounds, this implies that $f_a$ falls within a narrow range $f_a\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, corresponding to the axion mass $m_a\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\, \rm eV$. At this scale, the QCD axion constitutes a minor fraction of the total cold dark matter (DM) density $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. In this work, we investigate the issue of QCD axion DM within the context of the dark dimension and demonstrate that the QCD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM abundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. Specifically, we consider the resonant conversion of an axion-like particle (ALP) into the QCD axion. We find that, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of approximately $m_A \sim 10^{-5} \, \rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A \sim 10^{11} \, \rm GeV$, the QCD axion in the dark dimension can account for the overall DM. The ALP required within this specific range may originate from the grand unification of gauge forces in the dark dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a light and short review on the geometry of hypermultiplets coupled to supergravity and its appearance in string theory. As is long known, the target space of the hypermultiplet sigma-model is a quaternion-K\"ahler (QK) manifold of negative scalar curvature. We review some aspects of hypermultiplet moduli spaces, but also study aspects of QK-geometries in relation to the swampland, including some concrete examples of swampland QK-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order chiral scalar from boundary reduction of 3d higher-spin gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed covariant procedure to reduce the Chern-Simons action of three-dimensional higher-spin gravity to the boundary, resulting in a Lorentz covariant action for higher-order chiral scalars. After gauge-fixing, we obtain a higher-derivative action generalizing the $s=1$ Floreanini-Jackiw and $s=2$ Alekseev-Shatashvili actions to arbitrary spin $s$. For simplicity, we treat the case of general spin at the linearized level, while the full non-linear asymptotic boundary conditions are presented in component form for the $SL(3,\mathbb R)$ case. Finally, we extend the spin-3 linearized analysis to a background with non-trivial higher-spin charge and show that it has a richer structure of zero modes.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents as probes for a phase transition of a Kerr-AdS black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we study proper time Lyapunov exponents and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and massive particles orbiting a four-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, and explore their relationships with the phase transition of this black hole. The result reveals that both types of Lyapunov exponents can reflect the occurrence of the phase transition. Specifically, when compared to the proper time and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of massive particles in chaotic states, the exponents corresponding to massless particles demonstrate a more robust capability in describing the phase transition. Furthermore, we conduct a study on critical exponents associated with these Lyapunov exponents in this black hole, identifying a critical exponent value of 1/2.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>Transition between Schwarzschild black hole and string black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the quantum transition between a Schwarzschild black hole and a string black hole in the large $D$ limit. Classically, such a transition between these two distinct black hole geometries is forbidden. The only feasible discussion is centered on how a black hole evaporates, loses mass, and transitions into highly excited fundamental strings. Building upon our previous work on T-duality between the Schwarzschild and string black holes, we reduce the problem to two dimensions, where the corresponding Wheeler-De Witt equation can be derived. Using this equation, we identify the two black hole geometries as distinct wave function states. This allows us to easily compute the transition probability between these two geometries, driven by the string coupling.</description>

      <title>Large charge meets semiclassics in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-charge sector of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with $SU(N)$ gauge group by constructing a special class of half-BPS heavy operators, termed "canonical operators". Such operators exhibit remarkable simplicity in the large-charge 't Hooft limit, where the dimension of the operators $\Delta \to \infty$ with $\Delta\, g_{\text{YM}}^2$ held finite. Canonical operator insertions in this regime map $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM onto the Coulomb branch, by assigning a classical profile to the scalar fields with non-vanishing values along the diagonals given by the roots of unity. We follow a semiclassical approach to study two-point, three-point and Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light (HHLL) correlators. In particular we show that HHLL correlators in the large-charge 't Hooft limit are computed as two-point functions in a background determined by the classical profiles. We provide consistent evidence of our findings by computing the same observables via supersymmetric localization.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>On the Seven-loop Renormalization of Gross-Neveu Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of an infinite number of marginal four-fermion operators is a key characteristic of the two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. In this study, we investigate the structure of UV divergences in this model, and by symmetry argument we found that the renormalizability only requires a subset of evanescent operators. We perform a 7-loop renormalization computation of beta function for the corresponding evanescent operator, and confirm its non-trivial contribution to UV divergences. By integrating infrared rearrangement, dimensional shifting, and large momentum expansion techniques, we systematically reduce the two-dimensional tensor integrals in the four-fermion correlation functions into four-dimensional scalar integrals. These scalar integrals are subsequently evaluated using the graphical function method, which marks the first application of the method to models with fermionic fields. Our result represents the first time that beta functions have been computed analytically beyond 5-loop in a model with spinning particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>

      <title>Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Dipolar tidal effects in gravitational waves from scalarized black hole binary inspirals in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging binary black holes (BHs) enable unprecedented tests of gravitational theories beyond Einstein's General Relativity (GR) in highly nonlinear, dynamical regimes. Such GW measurements require an accurate description of GW signatures that may arise in alternative gravitational models. In this work, we focus on a class of higher-curvature extensions of GR, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, where BHs can develop scalar hair. In an inspiraling binary system, this leads to scalar-induced tidal effects in the dynamics and radiation. We calculate the dominant adiabatic dipolar tidal effects via an approximation scheme based on expansions in post-Newtonian, higher-curvature, and tidal corrections. The tidal effects depend on a characteristic scalar Love number, which we compute using BH perturbation theory, and have the same scaling with GW frequency as the higher-curvature corrections. We perform case studies to characterize the net size and parameter dependencies of these effects, showing that at low frequencies, tidal effects dominate over the higher-curvature contributions for small couplings within current bounds, regardless of the total BH mass, while at high frequencies they are subdominant. We further consider prospects observing both of these regimes, which would be interesting for breaking parameter degeneracies, with multiband detections of LISA and ground-based detectors or the Einstein Telescope alone. We also assess the frequency range of the transition between these regimes by numerically solving the energy balance law. Our results highlight the importance of the dipolar scalar tidal effects for BHs with scalar hair, which arise in several beyond-GR paradigms, and provide ready-to-use inputs for improved GW constraints on Gauss-Bonnet theories.</description>

Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave (GW) emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence, with LIGO detections since GW150914 showing the radiated energy $E_{\mathrm{GW}}$ scales approximately as one-tenth of the chirp mass: $\sim\mathcal{M}/10$. While evident in numerical relativity, this scaling lacks a simple analytical form without ad hoc assumptions. We model the binary as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume, and from the energy density of a gravitating body with torsion we yield a classical peak radiated energy of $E_\mathrm{GW}=(5/48)\mathcal{M}$. Refining this via stochastic gravity, we treat first-order metric perturbations as graviton fluctuations, applying relativistic kinetic theory to a Bose-Einstein-distributed graviton gas. This derives the peak radiated energy at the chirp mass as the gas' effective thermal energy: $E_\mathrm{GW}\simeq 0.11296\mathcal{M}$, matching LIGO data with 1:1 ratios of 0.851--0.998. This quantum-classical correspondence suggests graviton gas kinematics (e.g., GW/graviton wave-particle duality, high-energy graviton-graviton scattering) and invites noise analysis and post-coalescence studies.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

Abstract: DWs represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of GWs produced by scalar perturbations generated from the DW network. Our findings indicate that the GW spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future GW experiments aimed at exploring the role of DWs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate slow roll inflation and the creation of primordial density fluctuations in the framework of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. Our focus is on constraining the evolution of both the background and perturbations in this theory, specifically using the form $f(Q,T) = \alpha Q + g(T)$, where $g(T)$ is an arbitrary function of the trace of the stress-energy tensor $T$. We derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations for scalar and tensor perturbations, and by solving these equations in the slow-roll regime, we compute the power spectra and spectral index for both modes within the general functional framework of $g(T)$. In particular, we examine power law functional forms of $g(T)$ to establish the observational constraints associated with quadratic potential. By imposing constraints on the model's parameters, we obtain results that align closely with the Planck 2018 data and BAO data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Notably, a model that includes $g(T) = \beta T^2$ and a quadratic potential yields the best-fit values consistent with the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio suggested by the Planck and BICEP2 results.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions, and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model which represents a smooth perturbative expansion around the $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmological analysis is carried out by calculating the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, for selected values of the parameters. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM case. Several late-time cosmological parameters are computed, such as: dark energy state parameter, deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of the classical energy conditions WEC, SEC, NEC, and DEC for both the combination of matter and geometrical contribution and the geometrical contribution alone. Beyond the background level, linear matter perturbations are studied by calculating parameters relevant to structure growth and formation. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe by means late-time deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Inverse logarithmic correction in the HBAR entropy of an atom falling into a renormalization group improved charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have considered a spherically symmetric non-rotating charged black hole geometry where both the Newton's gravitational constant and the charge of the black hole flows with the energy scale. We have used the Kretschmann scale identification to write down the finite cutoff for the momentum scale in terms of the proper distance. Introducing the flow of running couplings, the event horizon radius of the black hole using quantum improved Reissner-Nordstrom metric was found in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.066016}{Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 066016}. We have, in this work, explored the thought experiment of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum improved charged black hole and have computed the transition probability of the atom for going from its ground state to the excited state via emission of a virtual photon. We find that the probability deviates slightly from the pure Planckian spectrum. We have showed that this deviation is due to the presence of incomplete lower gamma function in the distribution function. We have then computed the horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy and found that it is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy followed by the renormalization group correction terms including an inverse logarithmic and a square root of the area term due to emitting photons.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal gravity in a proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the role of the nonlocal effects is analogous to that of exotic matter in general relativity, owing to their quantum nature. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>Bound-Unbound Universality and the All-Order Semi-Classical Wave Function in Schwarzschild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for analytically computing time-dependent observables for a relativistic probe particle in Coulomb and Schwarzschild backgrounds. The method generates expressions valid both in the bound and unbound regimes, namely bound-unbound universal expressions. To demonstrate our method we compute the time-dependent radius and azimuthal angle for relativistic motion in a Coulomb background (relativistic Keplerian motion), as well as the electromagnetic field radiated by a relativistic Keplerian source. All of our calculations exhibit bound-unbound universality. Finally, we present an exact expression for the semi-classical wave function in Schwarzschild. The latter is crucial in applying our method to any time-dependent observable for probe-limit motion in Schwarzschild, to any desired order in velocity and the gravitational constant $G$.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>
