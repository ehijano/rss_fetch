      <title>Asset Prices with Overlapping Generations and Capital Accumulation: Tirole (1985) Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic paper of Tirole "Asset Bubbles and Overlapping Generations" (1985, Econometrica), which shows that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital over-accumulation problem. While Tirole's main insight holds with pure bubbles (assets without dividends), we argue that his original analysis with a dividend-paying asset contains some issues. We provide a fairly complete analysis of Tirole's model with general dividends such as equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and long-run behavior under weaker but explicit assumptions and complement with examples based on closed-form solutions. Some of the claims in Tirole (1985) require qualifications including (i) after the introduction of an asset with negligible dividends, the economy may collapse towards zero capital stock ("resource curse") and (ii) the necessity of bubbles is less clear-cut.</description>

      <title>Beyond Human Intervention: Algorithmic Collusion through Multi-Agent Learning Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collusion in market pricing is a concept associated with human actions to raise market prices through artificially limited supply. Recently, the idea of algorithmic collusion was put forward, where the human action in the pricing process is replaced by automated agents. Although experiments have shown that collusive market equilibria can be reached through such techniques, without the need for human intervention, many of the techniques developed remain susceptible to exploitation by other players, making them difficult to implement in practice. In this article, we explore a situation where an agent has a multi-objective strategy, and not only learns to unilaterally exploit market dynamics originating from other algorithmic agents, but also learns to model the behaviour of other agents directly. Our results show how common critiques about the viability of algorithmic collusion in real-life settings can be overcome through the usage of slightly more complex algorithms.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>

      <title>Censored Beliefs and Wishful Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model elucidating wishful thinking, which comprehensively incorporates both the costs and benefits associated with biased beliefs. Our findings reveal that wishful thinking behavior can be characterized as equivalent to superquantile-utility maximization within the domain of threshold beliefs distortion cost functions. By leveraging this equivalence, we establish WT as driving decision-makers to exhibit a preference for choices characterized by skewness and increased risk. Furthermore, we discuss how our framework facilitates the study of optimistic stochastic choice and optimistic risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Why Transaction Cost Economics Failed and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connotation of transaction costs has never been definitively determined, and the independence of the concept has never been rigorously demonstrated. This paper delves into the thought systems of several prominent economists in the development of transaction cost economics, starting from first-hand materials. By combining multiple works of the authors, it reconstructs the true meanings and identifies endogeneity issues and logical inconsistencies. The conclusion of this paper is bold. Previous research has been largely filled with misinterpretations and misunderstandings, as people have focused solely on the wording of transaction cost definitions, neglecting the nature of transaction costs. The intention of transaction cost theory has been unwittingly assimilated into the objects it intends to criticize. After delineating the framework of "transaction costs-property rights-competition", this paper reconstructs the concept of transaction costs and the history of transaction cost concepts, providing a direct response to this theoretical puzzle that has plagued the academic community for nearly a century.</description>

      <title>The Division of Surplus and the Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surplus must be divided between a principal and an agent. Only the agent knows the surplus' true size and decides how much of it to reveal initially. Both parties can exert costly effort to conclusively prove the surplus' true size. The agent's liability is bounded by the revealed surplus. The principal is equipped with additional funds. The principal designs a mechanism that allocates the burden of proof and divides the surplus. In principal-optimal mechanisms, the principal's effort to acquire proof decreases in the revealed surplus. The agent's effort initially decreases, but then the sign of its slope alternates across five intervals. Applications include wealth taxation, corporate finance, and public procurements.</description>
