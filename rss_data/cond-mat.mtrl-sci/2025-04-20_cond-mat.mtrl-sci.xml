      <title>Novel phenomena in transition-metal oxide thin films and heterostructures with strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal oxides have been a central subject of condensed matter physics for decades. In addition to novel electronic states driven by the influence of strong correlation, relativistic spin-orbit coupling effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential to explore topological phenomena. In this article, we review various experimental and theoretical studies on transition-metal oxides with focus on thin films and heterostructures where their physics is much influenced by correlation effects and spin-orbit coupling. The combination of the heterostructure geometry together with correlation and topology leads to a variety of novel states here reviewed. We also discuss perspectives for future research in this broad promising area.</description>

      <title>Increasing Downshifting Luminescence Intensity Through an Extended Active Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of rare-earth doped nanoparticles (RENPs), known as downshifting luminescence, has been extensively investigated in diverse applications from information technology to biomedicine. In promoting brightness and enriching the functionalities of the downshifting luminescence of RENPs, numerous studies have exploited inert shell to protect rare-earth dopants from surface quenchers. However, internal concentration quenching remains an unsolved puzzle when using higher dopant concentrations of rare-earth ions in an attempt to obtain brighter emission. Following a plethora of research involving core-shell structures, the interface has shown to be controllable, ranging from a well-defined, abrupt boundary to an obscure one with cation intermixing. By utilizing this inter-mixed core-shell property for the first time, we design a new architecture to create a homogeneous double-layer core-shell interface to extend the active layer, allowing more luminescent centers without severe concentration quenching. By systematically deploying the crystallinity of the starting core, shell growth dynamics, and dopant concentrations, the downshifting luminescence intensity of new archictecture achieves a 12-fold enhancement surpassing the traditional core-shell structure. These results provide deeper insight into the potential benefits of the intermixed core-shell structure, offering an effective approach to tackling the internal concentration quenching effect for highly boosted NIR optical performance.</description>

      <title>Write Cycling Endurance Exceeding 1010 in Sub-50 nm Ferroelectric AlScN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics, particularly aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), have emerged as a promising materials platform for nonvolatile memories, offering high polarization values exceeding 100 uC/cm2. However, their high coercive fields (&gt;3 MV/cm) have limited cycling endurance to ~107 cycles in previous reports. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control of polarization switching in AlScN, achieving write cycling endurance exceeding 1010 cycles a thousand fold improvement over previous wurtzite ferroelectric benchmarks. Through precise voltage modulation in 45 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N capacitors, we show that while complete polarization reversal (2Pr ~ 200 uC/cm2) sustains ~108 cycles, partial switching extends endurance beyond 1010 cycles while maintaining a substantial polarization (&gt;30 uC/cm2 for 2Pr). This exceptional endurance, combined with breakdown fields approaching 10 MV/cm in optimized 10 um diameter devices, represents the highest reported values for any wurtzite ferroelectric. Our findings establish a new paradigm for reliability in nitride ferroelectrics, demonstrating that controlled partial polarization and size scaling enables both high endurance and energy efficient operation.</description>

      <title>Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to higher bandgap WS2, due to the near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evident by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. We also find that, at 300 K the estimated ET timescale of around 45 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K+ to K-) time and comparable with the interlayer charge transfer time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive AI decision interface for autonomous electronic material discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) can accelerate materials discovery but its effectiveness for electronic materials is hindered by data scarcity from lengthy and complex design-fabricate-test-analyze cycles. Unlike experienced human scientists, even advanced AI algorithms in AI/AE lack the adaptability to make informative real-time decisions with limited datasets. Here, we address this challenge by developing and implementing an AI decision interface on our AI/AE system. The central element of the interface is an AI advisor that performs real-time progress monitoring, data analysis, and interactive human-AI collaboration for actively adapting to experiments in different stages and types. We applied this platform to an emerging type of electronic materials-mixed ion-electron conducting polymers (MIECPs) -- to engineer and study the relationships between multiscale morphology and properties. Using organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) as the testing-bed device for evaluating the mixed-conducting figure-of-merit -- the product of charge-carrier mobility and the volumetric capacitance ({\mu}C*), our adaptive AI/AE platform achieved a 150% increase in {\mu}C* compared to the commonly used spin-coating method, reaching 1,275 F cm-1 V-1 s-1 in just 64 autonomous experimental trials. A study of 10 statistically selected samples identifies two key structural factors for achieving higher volumetric capacitance: larger crystalline lamellar spacing and higher specific surface area, while also uncovering a new polymer polymorph in this material.</description>

      <title>Compensation-Like Temperature and Spin-Flip Switch in Strained Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films: Tuning Sublattice Interactions for Ferrimagnetic Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain rare-earth iron garnet (RIG) thin films combine desirable properties such as low magnetic damping, high magnetostriction, and, in some cases, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making them attractive for spintronics applications. However, the interplay between their magnetic sublattices in confined films remains poorly explored, particularly the coupling between 3d and 4f electrons. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of a 30 nm-thick thulium iron garnet (TmIG) thin film, where tensile strain promotes PMA. SQUID magnetometry and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism measurements reveal a magnetization minimum near 50 K under moderate magnetic fields, leading to a compensation-like temperature (Tcomp-like), a feature absent in bulk TmIG. The presence of Tcomp-like is particularly relevant for controlling magnetization dynamics through compensation phenomena. Additionally, we observe a field-induced spin-flip transition in the Tm sublattice, where Tm moments reorient and align ferromagnetically concerning the Fe sublattices. This mechanism can be exploited for energy-efficient magnetization reversal. These findings provide new insights into strain-driven magnetic phenomena in rare-earth iron garnet thin films, highlighting the interplay between exchange interactions and anisotropy in confined geometries, which is crucial for the development of spintronic and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer induced insulating state at antiperovskite/perovskite heterointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterointerfaces have been pivotal in unveiling extraordinary interfacial properties and enabling multifunctional material platforms. Despite extensive research on all-oxide interfaces, heterointerfaces between different material classes, such as oxides and nitrides, remain underexplored. Here we present the fabrication of a high-quality Dirac metal antiperovskite Ni3InN, characterized by an extremely low temperature coefficient of resistivity, approximately 1.8*10^-8 {\Omega}*cm/K, over a broad temperature range. Atomically sharp heterointerfaces between Ni3InN and SrVO3 were constructed, revealing intriguing interfacial phenomena. Leveraging layer-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we identified pronounced charge transfer across the well-ordered interface. Remarkably, this interfacial electron transfer from Ni3InN to SrVO3 induces an insulating interfacial layer and an emergent magnetic moment within the Ni3InN layer, consistent with first-principles calculations. These findings pave the way for novel electronic and spintronic applications by enabling tunable interfacial properties in nitride/oxide systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting flow stress surfaces of pristine materials using deformation paths in MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of deformation processes at the atomic scale is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials and particularly the calculation of directional flow stresses. This work presents a method for applying arbitrary deformation paths in LAMMPS while adhering to its convention that supercell periodic vectors a, b are aligned such that a coincides with the x-axis and b lies in the (x,y) plane. This method is particularly relevant for materials with low crystal symmetry and also for exploring non uniaxial deformations. The first step of the method consists in generating the simulation frame tensor's time evolution upon any deformation, which may initially violate LAMMPS alignment constraints. This constraint is then overcome by the application of a rigid body rotation to realign the tensor with LAMMPS's convention, ensuring valid periodic boundary conditions. The resulting lengths and tilt factors from the rotated tensor are expressed analytically using third-order polynomials and applied to the simulation cell using the fix deform command. The present approach versatility is validated with the calculation of directional flow stresses for various materials upon constant volume shear, tension and compression, demonstrating its effectiveness in simulations involving complex deformation scenarios and diverse crystal structures. The flow stress surface extracted from these simulations are finally analyzed as the fingerprint of all deformation mechanisms occurring in the material.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependent ab initio study of the physical properties of hexagonal BeB2C: a possible high-Tc superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the Density Functional Theory to explore the pressure dependent properties of hexagonal BeB2C. The metallic nature of BeB2C was substantiated at ambient pressure, with pressure induced alterations in electronic band structure and Fermi surface topology suggesting a potential for tunability across various applications. The phonon dispersion and phonon density of states show the dynamical stability under pressure. The thermophysical properties are also investigated under varying pressure conditions. Finally, the exploration of superconducting properties found that the transition temperature is in good agreement with previously reported values, and illustrated that beB2C holds considerable promise as a high-temperature superconductor, with pressure augmenting its superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-accounting for effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of first-principles methods. To address this, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), based on the Allegro architecture-an E(3)-equivariant model -- specifically tailored to capture subtle CDW effects in NbSe$_2$. These MLIPs enable efficient exploration of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, as well as the dimensional dependence of the transition temperature, evaluated using the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Our findings reveal a strong sensitivity of CDWs to stacking and layer number, and a slight suppression of the transition temperature with increasing thickness. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other 2D systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.</description>

      <title>Orientation attractors in velocity gradient driven processes for large plastic deformations of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lattice orientation attractors, also referred to as preferred or ideal orientations, in crystalline materials, and how they can be used to predict the final texture of polycrystals after manufacturing processes. By treating Crystal Plasticity (CP) in an Eulerian framework, rather than traditional Lagrangian approaches, we overcome the significant challenges associated with lattice distortion, enabling accurate simulations of material behavior under large deformations. This Eulerian perspective allows us to track the evolution of crystallographic orientations directly in the spatial domain, providing crucial insights into texture development. The CP models employed here capture the microstructural evolution in both mono- and polycrystalline materials, with particular emphasis on velocity gradient driven processes. Our linear stability analysis strategy, while applicable to general CP formulations, is demonstrated using a simplified rigid-(visco)-plastic 2-D model with three slip systems. This approach successfully predicts the lattice orientation attractors for very large strains (exceeding 50$\%$) by analyzing how different slip systems interact under applied loads. Three numerical simulations illustrate the theory's effectiveness: polycrystal deformation under homogeneous velocity gradient loading, void evolution in a monocrystal under non-homogeneous loading, and slip band formation during uni-axial traction. High-resolution CP simulations, enhanced through re-meshing techniques, further validate our findings on how initial crystallographic orientations, deformation mechanisms, and loading conditions affect the evolution of orientation attractors and ultimate crystal texture.</description>

      <title>Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} &lt; {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</description>

      <title>Generating new coordination compounds via multireference simulations, genetic algorithms and machine learning: the case of Co(II) molecular magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches</description>

      <title>Accurate Point Defect Energy Levels from Non-Empirical Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals: the Case of Native Vacancies in ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use density functional theory (DFT) with non-empirically tuned screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals to calculate the electronic properties of native zinc and oxygen vacancy point defects in ZnO, and we predict their defect levels for thermal and optical transitions in excellent agreement with available experiments and prior calculations that use empirical hybrid functionals. The ability of this non-empirical first-principles framework to accurately predict quantities of relevance to both bulk and defect level spectroscopy enables high-accuracy DFT calculations with non-empirical hybrid functionals for defect physics, at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a superzone gap, typically associated with antiferroic ordering, can also emerge from ferroic orders in systems with sublattice degrees of freedom. By analyzing a $p$-orbital tight-binding model on a zigzag chain, we show that a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger-type gap is induced by ferroquadrupolar or ferromagnetic order or by applying an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging and charge state manipulation of NV centers by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.</description>

      <title>Long-range electron coherence in Kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons lies at the core of quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical particles. Landmark experiments have revealed phase coherence of mobile electrons within solids, such as Aharonov-Bohm interference in mesoscopic rings. However, this coherence is typically limited by numerous environmental interactions. Controlling and ideally mitigating such decoherence remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic pillars of the Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ for fields applied parallel to the Kagome planes. Their periodicity is independent of materials parameters, simply given by the number of flux quanta $h/e$ threading between adjacent Kagome layers akin to an atomic-scale Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Intriguingly they occur under conditions not favorable for typical interference in solids, at temperatures above 20 K and in micrometer-scale devices well exceeding the single-particle mean free path. Further, the oscillations exhibit non-analytic field-angle dependence and scale consistently with a broad range of key electronic responses in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, pointing to a cooperative mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. Our findings provide new insights into the debated origin of correlated order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and establish Kagome metals as a promising platform for interaction-stabilized long-range electron coherence - crucial for both fundamental studies and technological advancements in quantum interference in metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Isotropic and anisotropic spin-dependent transport in epitaxial Fe$_3$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-dependent transport phenomena in epitaxially grown Fe$_3$Si films, focusing on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and spin Hall effect (SHE). While the sign and magnitude of the AMR and PHE depend on the current orientation relative to the crystallographic axes, the AHE and SHE remain nearly independent of the current orientation. The anisotropic AMR and PHE are attributed to current and magnetization dependent local band properties, including band crossing/anticrossing at specific $k$ points. In contrast, the isotropic AHE and SHE arise from the Berry curvature integrated over the entire Brillouin zone, which cancels local variations. These findings highlight the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and magnetization in the spin-dependent transport phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for optically inducing, controlling, and probing spin states in moir\'e systems. In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moir\'e bilayers. Furthermore, we establish direct connections between the resulting spin correlations and experimentally observable optical signals. Our work paves the way for future studies on the optical control and detection on strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Randomness in atomic disorder and consequent squandering of spin-polarization in a ferromagnetically fragile quaternary Heusler alloy FeRuCrSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi ( 0 $&lt;$ x $&lt;$1) system is theoretically predicted to be one of the very few known examples of robust half-metallic ferromagnet with 100\% spin polarization. Since Cr is considered to be the main contributor to magnetism, the Fe/Ru substitution is not expected to disturb its magnetic properties any significantly, and hence all Fe-containing members of the series are predicted to follow Slater-Pauling rule with a saturation magnetic moment of 2 ${\mu_B}$/f.u. However, contrarily to the theoretical expectations, some experiments rather show a linear variation of the saturation magnetization and Curie temperature with Fe (\textit{x}) substitution. The equiatomic member FeRuCrSi of this family is also considered as a technologically important material, where the band structure calculations suggest the material to be spin gapless semiconductor. Through our in-depth structural analysis of FeRuCrSi using X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure and $^{57}$Fe M\"{o}ssbauer spectrometry, we found a random disorder between Fe and Ru sites, while the magnetic moment in this system is actually contributed by Fe atoms, questioning the very basic foundation of the half-metallic character proposed by all theoretical calculations on Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi series. Our M\"{o}ssbauer result also envisions a rather rare scenario where the main physical properties are intricately correlated to the chemistry of the material in the form of random atomic disorder on a localised scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish rigorous inequalities between different electronic properties linked to optical sum rules, and organize them into weak and strong bounds on three characteristic properties of insulators: electron localization length $\ell$ (the quantum fluctuations in polarization), electric susceptibility $\chi$, and optical gap $E_{\rm G}$. All-electron and valence-only versions of the bounds are given, and the latter are found to be more informative. The bounds on $\ell$ are particularly interesting, as they provide reasonably tight estimates for an ellusive ground-state property - the average localization length of valence electrons - from tabulated experimental data: electron density, high-frequency dielectric constant, and optical gap. The localization lengths estimated in this way for several materials follow simple chemical trends, especially for the alkali halides. We also illustrate our findings via analytically solvable harmonic oscillator models, which reveal an intriguing connection to the physics of long-ranged van der Waals forces.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films. We further show that supercurrent states are realized in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs. These results clearly demonstrate we have achieved growing high-quality epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures, a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum information science and microelectronics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, the expected prohibitive energetic barriers are overcomed while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Control of ferroelectric domain wall dynamics by point defects: Insights from ab initio based simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on the nanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronics and novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle this challenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamental understanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is, however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defect dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresented in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamics simulations based on an \textit{ab\ initio}-derived effective Hamiltonian and methods from materials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on the motion of 180$^{\circ}$ domain walls in tetragonal BaTiO$_3$. We show how these defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces on the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow around sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how pinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect distribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and walls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the nucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area in front of the wall.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials.This work demonstrates that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The $x$-direction component of SC exhibits a ferroicity-driven switching behavior. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (&gt; 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be &gt; 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical implementation, based on Wannier interpolation, of a Kubo-Greenwood formalism for computing the spatially dispersive optical conductivity in crystals at first order in the wave vector of light. This approach is more efficient than direct $\textit{ab initio}$ methods because, with less computational cost, it allows for a much finer sampling of reciprocal space, resulting in better resolved spectra. Moreover, Wannier interpolation avoids errors arising from truncation of the sums over conduction bands when evaluating the spatially dispersive optical matrix elements. We validate our method by computing the optical activity spectrum of selected crystals, both polar (GaN) and chiral (trigonal Te, trigonal Se, and $\alpha$-quartz), and comparing with existing literature.</description>

Abstract: Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a critical component for stabilizing lithium metal anode and high-voltage cathodes towards the next-generation high-energy-density lithium batteries. Recent modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below about 550 K (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to experimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below about 800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses--alongside energies and forces--in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF under the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects are often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial stresses during the training of MLFF to enable accurate modeling of solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>High Breakdown Electric Field (&gt; 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12685</link>

Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage &gt; 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The reported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next generation high-power radio frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron-phonon scattering in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological antiferromagnetic systems, which exhibit anisotropic band structures combined with complex relativistic spin structures in momentum space, have shown strong magnetoresistance effects driven by Dirac fermion characteristics. While these new antiferromagnets have been studied in transport experiments, very little is known about their spin-dependent electronic dynamics on ultrafast timescales and far-from-equilibrium behavior. This paper investigates theoretically the spin-dependent electronic dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering in a model electronic band structure that corresponds to a Dirac semimetal antiferromagnet. Following a spin conserving instantaneous excitation we obtain a change of the antiferromagnetic spin polarization due to the scattering dynamics for the site-resolved spin expectation values. This allows us to identify fingerprints of the anisotropic band structure in the carrier dynamics on ultrashort timescales.</description>

      <title>Collective optical properties of moir\'e excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin-orbit Torques by Two-dimensional Multilayered MXenes for Future Nonvolatile Magnetic Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structures with various functionalities similar to those of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. To open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices, such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure comprising bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using the magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrated field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the bilayer structure, regardless of the charge current directions with respect to the mirror symmetry lines of Cr2N crystal. This is a specific characteristic for the 2D MXene-based SOT-devices, originating from an unconventional out-of-plane SOT. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculations predict an intrinsic orbital-Hall conductivity with the dominant out-of-plane component, comparing to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, induced by contact with the Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. Therefore, the intrinsic bulk orbital Hall effect in MXene and the interfacial contribution such as spin-filtering-like effect owing to uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr are considered as possible major mechanisms for the unconventional out-of-plane SOT in the device, rather than a crystal symmetry and/or an interlayer exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates 198 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 34 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only eleven semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.</description>

      <title>Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</description>
