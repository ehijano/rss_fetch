      <title>Nucleation feedback can drive establishment and maintenance of biased microtubule polarity in neurites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microtubule cytoskeleton is comprised of dynamic, polarized filaments that facilitate transport within the cell. Polarized microtubule arrays are key to facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules also undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the filaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent microtubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and new filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain their biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their polarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton organization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of microtubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could generate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize two experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where the direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a checkpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite to the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these validated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback is sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths, and that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is robust in spite of stochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the relationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to give insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament arrays in other biological settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of machine-learning models to measure individualized treatment effects from randomized clinical trial data with time-to-event outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In randomized clinical trials, regression models can be used to explore the relationships between patients' variables (e.g., clinical, pathological or lifestyle variables, and also biomarker or genomics data) and the magnitude of treatment effect. Our aim is to evaluate the value of flexible machine learning models that can incorporate interactions and nonlinear effects of high-dimensional data to estimate individualized treatment recommendations in the setting of such trials with time-to-event outcomes. We compare survival models based on neural networks (CoxCC and CoxTime) and random survival forests (Interaction Forests). A Cox model, including an adaptive LASSO penalty, is used as a benchmark. Specific metrics for individualized treatment recommendations are used: the C-for-Benefit, the E50-for-Benefit, and RMSE for treatment benefit. We conduct an extensive simulation study using 2 different data generation processes incorporating nonlinearity and interactions up to the third order. The models are applied to gene expression and clinical data from 2 breast cancer studies. The machine learning-based methods show reasonable performances on the simulation data sets, especially in terms of discrimination for Interaction Forests and calibration for the neural networks. They can be used to evaluate individualized treatment effects from randomized trials when nonlinear and interaction effects are expected to be present.</description>

      <title>Maximal Speed of Glucose Change Significantly Distinguishes Prediabetes from Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid changes in blood glucose levels can have severe and immediate health consequences, leading to the need to develop indices for assessing these rapid changes based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We proposed a CGM index, maxSpeed, that represents the maximum of speed of glucose change (SGC) in a subject, respectively, and conducted a clinical study to investigate this index along with SGC mean (meanSpeed) and SGC standard deviation (sdSpeed), coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), glycemic variability percentage (GVP), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAG), mean absolute glucose excursion (MAGE), mean of daily differences (MODD) and continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA). Our study revealed that, there exist multiple patterns in distinguishing non-diabetes, prediabetes, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). First, maxSpeed significantly distinguishes between either of non-diabetes and prediabetes and either of T1D and T2D. Second, meanSpeed, sdSpeed, GVP and MAG significantly distinguish between non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D. Third, MODD and CONGA of 24 hours significantly distinguish between non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D, between T1D and either of prediabetes and T2D. Fourth, SD, MAGE and CONGA of 12 hours significantly distinguish between non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D, between T1D and pre-diabetes. Fifth, CV significantly distinguishes between T1D and either of Non-diabetes and T2D. maxSpeed assesses the rapid change of glucose in a short term, which is important both biologically and clinicially because our human body may not tolerate too rapid change in a short term.</description>

      <title>A simplified and robust proxy-based approach for overcoming unmeasured confounding in EHR studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) are used to study treatment effects in clinical settings, yet unmeasured confounding remains a persistent challenge. Indirect measurements of the unmeasured confounder (proxies) offer a potential solution, but existing approaches -- such as proximal inference or full joint modeling -- can be difficult to implement. We propose a two-stage, proxy-based method that is practical, broadly applicable, and robust. In the first stage, we apply factor analysis to proxy and treatment variables, extracting information on latent factors that serve as a surrogate for the unmeasured confounder. In the second stage, we use this model to build covariates that improve causal effect estimation in a standard outcome regression model. Through simulations, we test the method's performance under assumption violations, including non-normal errors, model misspecification, and scenarios where instruments or confounders are incorrectly treated as proxies. We also apply the method to estimate the effect of hospital admission for older adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, a setting where standard analyses may fail to recover plausible effects. Our results show that this simplified strategy recovers more reliable estimates than conventional adjustment methods, offering applied researchers a practical tool for addressing unmeasured confounding with proxy variables.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Causal Representation Learning for Biological Data in the Pathway Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cell Type Inference in Vision Language Models Under Varying Visual Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced alongside Large Language Models (LLMs). This study evaluates the capabilities of prominent generative VLMs, such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, accessed via APIs, for histopathology image classification tasks, including cell typing. Using diverse datasets from public and private sources, we apply zero-shot and one-shot prompting methods to assess VLM performance, comparing them against custom-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our findings demonstrate that while one-shot prompting significantly improves VLM performance over zero-shot ($p \approx 1.005 \times 10^{-5}$ based on Kappa scores), these general-purpose VLMs currently underperform supervised CNNs on most tasks. This work underscores both the promise and limitations of applying current VLMs to specialized domains like pathology via in-context learning.

      <title>PhenoKG: Knowledge Graph-Driven Gene Discovery and Patient Insights from Phenotypes Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the transport of intensity equation (TIE) can be used to reconstruct the spatial phase variations produced by samples such as magnetic materials and biological cells, the impact of complex refractive indices on quantitative phase imaging remains unexplored. To overcome this difficulty, we provide herein a more physically generalized TIE framework that enables the reconstruction of spatial variations in both refractive-index fluctuations and attenuation coefficients. We then demonstrate this method using bright-field microscopy imaging. The results reveal robust performance in retrieving heterogeneous optical structures within measurable parameter regions. Finally, we analyze the symmetry of the attenuation reversal in the TIE framework, thus revealing the invariant nature of the absorptive and scattering properties in the samples of interest.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>EUNIS Habitat Maps: Enhancing Thematic and Spatial Resolution for Europe through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3 within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of recall and precision across habitat formations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Inverse Optimal Control and its Application in Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms exhibit remarkable adaptations across all scales, from molecules to ecosystems. We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical identifiability is a critical concern in data-driven modeling of mathematical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.</description>

      <title>Predicting Novel Functional Roles of Designed Small Biomolecules: An ML Approach Utilizing PubChem Compound and Substance Identifiers (CID-SID ML model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significance and Object: The proposed methodology aims to provide time- and cost-effective approach for the early stage in drug discovery. The machine learning models developed in this study used only the identification numbers provided by PubChem. Thus, a drug development researcher who has obtained a PubChem CID and SID can easily identify new functionality of their compound. The approach was demonstrated, using four bioassay which were on (i) the antagonists of human D3 dopamine receptors; (ii) the promoter Rab9 activators; (iii) small molecule inhibitors of CHOP to regulate the unfolded protein response to ER stress; (iv) antagonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor. Solution: The four bioassays used for demonstration of the approach were provided by PubChem. For each bioassay, the generated by PubChem CIDs, SIDs were extracted together with the corresponding activity. The resulting dataset was sifted with the dataset on a water solubility bioassay, remaining only the compounds common for both bioassays. In this way, the inactive compounds were reduced. Then, all active compounds were added, and the resulted dataset was later used for machine learning based on scikit learn algorithms. Results: The average values of the ML models` metrics for the four bioassays were: 83.82% Accuracy with 5.35 standard deviation; 87.9% Precision with 5.04 standard deviation; 77.1% Recall with 7.65 standard deviation; 82.1% F1 with 6.44 standard deviation; 83.4% ROC with 5.09 standard deviation. Since the methodology was publicly available as a preprint, four more machine ML models have been developed. Their results are discussed in the "Results and Discussion" section.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern the pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy of drugs, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Decomposition of Brain Networks</title>

Abstract: We propose to analyze dynamically changing brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components through the Hodge decomposition. We propose to quantify the magnitude and relative strength of each component. We performed extensive simulation studies with known ground truth. The Hodge decomposition is then applied to the dynamically changing human brain networks obtained from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Our results indicate that the components of the Hodge decomposition contain biologically interpretable topological features that provide statistically significant findings not easily captured by traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.</description>

      <title>A Macroscopically Consistent Reactive Langevin Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models are a popular approach for capturing stochasticity in reaction and transport processes across biological systems. In some contexts, the overdamped approximation inherent in such models may be inappropriate, necessitating the use of more microscopic Langevin Dynamics models for spatial transport. In this work we develop a novel particle-based Reactive Langevin Dynamics (RLD) model, with a focus on deriving reactive interaction kernels that are consistent with the physical constraint of detailed balance of reactive fluxes at equilibrium. We demonstrate that, to leading order, the overdamped limit of the resulting RLD model corresponds to the volume reactivity PBSRD model, of which the well-known Doi model is a particular instance. Our work provides a step towards systematically deriving PBSRD models from more microscopic reaction models, and suggests possible constraints on the latter to ensure consistency between the two physical scales.</description>
