      <title>Analytical Model of the Evolution of Surface Topography During Sliding Wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the wear process of surfaces in sliding friction, there is a running-in period during which the topography of surfaces changes with time before reaching the steady wear regime. In the steady wear regime, the statistical parameters used to describe the topography of the surfaces remain almost constant. Some experimental studies have shown that starting friction tests with different surface finish levels leads to the same final topography of surfaces in the regime of steady wear. This article proposes an analytical model to describe the evolution of the topography of surfaces during sliding wear. First of all, the Greenwood and Williamson approach is used to describe the contact between nominally flat rough surfaces. The asperities in contact may undergo plastic deformation or adhesion with the opposing surface. Using a plasticity criterion and an adhesion criterion, it is possible to obtain a differential equation for the evolution of the standard deviation of the asperities of the surfaces. This equation has an analytical solution that is in good agreement with experimental results from the literature. It is shown that the final surface topography is the result of the competition between abrasive wear and adhesive wear. The model is then used to describe different wear processes from polishing to galling.</description>

      <title>Study on and off axis of levitation induced by a rotating permanent magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A slightly tilted permanent magnet rotating at high speed can induce a magnetic field capable of trapping another permanent magnet in a non-gravitational dependent levitated bound state, bypassing Earnshaw's theorem. During levitation, the floater magnet is locked in a conical orbit at the same frequency as the rotor. This rotation allows the sides of the same polarity of each magnet to face each other, which is responsible for the dynamic equilibrium of the floater magnet. Here, we theoretically explain the motion of the floater in-axis and off-axis and highlight levitation stability conditions and their dependence on the size of the floater and the speed of the rotor. We experimentally studied the levitation conditions with respect to the angular velocity of the rotor for different floater's sizes and shapes. We observed and analyzed the lower and upper limits of levitation. Finally, we explained the off-axis motion of the center of mass of the floater from its equilibrium position by an extension of the dipole moment model.</description>

      <title>The Hungry Daemon: An energy-harvesting active particle must obey the Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thought experiments like Maxwell's Demon or the Feynman-Smoluchowski Ratchet can help in pursuing the microscopic origin of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Here we present a more sophisticated physical system than a ratchet, consisting of a Hamiltonian active particle which can harvest energy from an environment which may be in thermal equilibrium at a single temperature. We show that while a phenomenological description would seem to allow the system to operate as a Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind, a full mechanical analysis confirms that this is impossible, and that perpetual energy harvesting can only occur if the environment has an energetic population inversion similar to a lasing medium.</description>
