      <title>Thermomagnetic Effects of Quark Matter in the NJL Model: Application of Regularization Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model of a thermally magnetized medium, the regularization methods adopted for the thermodynamic potential and the mass gap equation are utilized to calculate the relevant thermodynamic quantities in thermomagnetic quark matter. When dealing with the thermodynamic quantities and the gap equation, three schemes can be chosen, namely magnetic field-independent regularization, soft cut-off regularization, and Pauli-Villars regularization. These three regularization schemes have different influences on the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter, and different choices of regularization schemes will also lead to different effects in the calculation of the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Scattering phase shifts from overlap relations in the $J$-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering problem can be implemented in a square-integrable basis via the so-called $J$-matrix method. While methods to compute the phase shift in the $J$-matrix approach are known, we introduce a novel formula {in square-integrable bases} analogous to existing integral relations or overlap integrals in a {(continuous)} position basis. We demonstrate the method in single-channel potential scattering. Such a result is the first step towards a more general approach to scattering and reactions in popular many-body methods such as the configuration-interaction shell model.</description>

      <title>Exploring nuclear force with pulsar glitch observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect nuclear forces to one of the most notable irregular behaviors observed in pulsars, already detected in approximately 6\% known pulsars, with increasingly accurate data expected from upcoming high-precision timing instruments on both ground and space. Built on \cite{Shang2021_ApJ923-108}, we conduct a case study on the 2001 glitch of the Vela pulsar. For our purpose, we adopt the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model as the theoretical many-body framework to describe nuclear systems. We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the superfluidity model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>High Precision Binding Energies from Physics Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twelve physics informed machine learning models have been trained to model binding energy residuals. Our approach begins with determining the difference between measured experimental binding energies and three different mass models. Then four machine learning approaches are used to train on each energy difference. The most successful ML technique both in interpolation and extrapolation is the least squares boosted ensemble of trees. The best model resulting from that technique utilizes eight physical features to model the difference between experimental atomic binding energy values in AME 2012 and the Duflo Zucker mass model. This resulted in a model that fit the training data with a standard deviation of 17 keV and that has a standard deviation of 92 keV when compared all of the values in the AME 2020. The extrapolation capability of each model is discussed and the accuracy of predicting new mass measurements has also been tested.</description>

      <title>Jet substructure of light and heavy flavor jets at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider have been used to constrain parton distribution functions, test perturbative QCD, measure the strong-coupling constant, and probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. We extend these studies to lower energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that would additionally allow us to test existing models of non-perturbative physics. In this study, we present a \pythia-based Monte Carlo study of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The selection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We consider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet angularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of collinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.</description>

      <title>Off-shell vertices in heavy particle effective theories and $B\rightarrow D\pi \ell \nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modifications to decay amplitudes in heavy to heavy semileptonic decays with multiple hadrons in the final state due to intermediate heavy hadrons being off-shell or having a finite width. Combining Heavy Hadron Chiral Perturbation Theory (HH$\chi$PT) with a BCFW on-shell factorization formula, we show that these effects induce $O(1/M)$ corrections to the standard results computed in the narrow-width approximation and therefore are important in extracting form factors from data. A combination of perturbative unitarity, analyticity, and reparameterization invariance fully determine these corrections in terms of known Isgur-Wise functions without the need to introduce new form factors. In doing so, we develop a novel technique to compute the boundary term at complex infinity in the BCFW formula for theories with derivatively coupled scalars. While we have used the $\bar B\rightarrow D\pi \ell\nu$ decay as an example, these techniques can generally be applied to effective field theories with (multiple) distinct reference vectors.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. Dynamical variables involve chiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the EFT, we briefly discuss spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarisability of octet baryons near the physical quark-mass point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic polarisabilities of octet baryons are calculated close to the physical quark-mass point using the background field method in lattice QCD. This first calculation draws on the identification and elimination of exceptional configurations that have hindered previous attempts. The origin of the exceptional configuration problem lies in the use of a Wilson-type fermion action on electro-quenched gauge field configurations, where the dynamical-fermion gauge-field generation algorithm the electric charges of the quarks. Changes in the fermion determinant that would suppress some gauge fields in the background magnetic field are neglected, leaving improbable gauge fields that generate large additive mass renormalisations which manifest as significant outliers in correlation-function distributions. An algorithm for the systematic identification and removal of these exceptional configurations is described. We find the light up and down quarks to be problematic, particularly the up quark with its larger electric charge. The heavier mass of the strange quark protects the hyperon correlation functions to some extent. However, these also benefit from the removal of exceptional configurations. In many cases, the magnetic polarisability is calculated with good precision. We find our results to be in accord with the behaviour anticipated by chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signal of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in Au+Au collisions and isobar collisions of $_{44}^{96}\text{Ru}+\rm{} _{44}^{96}Ru$ and $_{40}^{96}\text{Zr}+\rm{}_{40}^{96}Zr$ in the newly developed chiral anomaly transport (CAT) module based on the state-of-the-art model a multiphase transport (AMPT). Our numerical simulation results for the ratio charge correlation $\Delta\gamma$ in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions are close to the latest experimental data. The simulation shows that the CME signal is larger in Ru+Ru collisions than that in Zr+Zr collisions, while the background is smaller, and the upper limit of the CME signal is $15\%$ in the isobar collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely observed that particles produced in high-energy collisions follow a power-law distribution. One such power-law distribution used extensively in the phenomenological studies owes its origin to nonadditive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this article, we derive a novel nonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using a single-mode harmonic oscillator. The approach taken in this paper eliminates the need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. We observe that the spectra of the bosonic particles like the pions and kaons produced in high-energy collisions are well-described by the nonadditive bosonic distribution derived in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (D-RHFB) model to describe the structure of neutron-rich carbon isotopes, taking into account the continuum, pairing correlations, tensor force and their interplay. In this scheme, one- and two-neutron separation energies of neutron-rich carbon isotopes agree well with measured data, as well as the spin and parity $J^\pi=1/2^+$ for the ground state of $^{19}$C, which is a long-standing problem for theoretical structure models. With the structure input extracted from the microscopic D-RHFB model, the reaction observables are well described the Glauber model. In particular, this unified approach accurately reproduces the inclusive longitudinal momentum distributions of the breakup reaction $^{19}$C + $^{12}$C at 240 MeV/nucleon, which rule out the possibility of the ground state of $^{19}$C being $J^\pi=3/2^+$. Moreover, the continuum plays a crucial role in the formation of the halo, which is further confirmed by the reaction cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions. However, the tensor force components carried by the $\pi$-coupling are not as significant as anticipated. Consequently, the D-RHFB + Glauber approach turns out to be a promising tool to search for halo candidates from the structure to the reaction.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Quark Matter in Massive Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high baryon densities ($\rho_B$) in a quark star (QS). The QS is built from the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM model), modified (MDDQM model) to obtain a higher maximum gravitational mass ($\rm M_{max}$) of the QS, using the data from observed pulsars: HESS J1731$-$347, PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, and PSR J0952$-$0607 as constraints in Bayesian inference to determine the model parameters. The parameters yielding a quark matter (QM) equation of state that generates $\rm M_{max} &gt; 2M_\odot$ violate the near-conformality conditions analyzed at high $\rho_B$. This behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the increasing quark population with $\rho_B$, along with the simultaneous formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, both of which are influenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\rho_B$ rises. This is reflected in the MDDQM model employed, which introduces an additional term that becomes significant at high densities. On the other hand, parameters that yield $\rm M_{max} &lt; 2M_\odot$ conform to the expected near-conformal behavior at higher densities, as analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity, transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of open-heavy flavored hadron production in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the upgradation of LHC, it is realized that study of heavy-flavored hadrons, namely $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and $\rm{D}^{0}$ in hadronic collisions, could reveal the possibility of thermalization of charm quarks. With this motivation, we study the production dynamics of these hadrons using a pQCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8 in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The production dynamics of these hadrons are analyzed through charged-particle multiplicity, transverse momentum, and pseudorapidity. With the help of the established PYTHIA8 tunes to mimic the behavior of flow-like features, we investigated the variation of effective temperature and degree of non-extensivity using thermodynamically consistent non-extensive Tsallis statistics. We further attempted to establish a connection between the initial state and final state by estimating the correlation between the number of multi-partonic interactions ($\rm{n}_{MPI}$) with the Knudsen number.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>Flavor asymmetry from the non-perturbative nucleon sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, in the context of a scalar version of the chiral effective field theory, that the multi-sea quark contribution to the nucleon is significant and highly non-trivial in sharp contrast to the prediction of perturbation theory. The non-perturbative calculation is performed in the Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme on the light front, in which the non-perturbative renormalization is incorporated. The calculation suggests that a fully non-perturbative calculation of the chiral EFT is needed to obtain a robust result to be compared with the recent experimental measurement of flavor asymmetry in the proton.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$ fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$ GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$ GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS }$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with theoretical systematic errors under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs by complementing our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>
