      <title>Relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered to have begun with a search for wave equations corresponding to each intrinsic spin. However, relativistic quantum physics differs fundamentally from the non-relativistic wave mechanics. It requires a formalism allowing \ creation and destruction of particles. This gets proper treatment only in a framework called quantum field theory. This article is a semi-historic account of the intriguing new features which emerge as a part of quantum field theory. Such a discussion is impossible without a basic presentation of the formalism itself. Hence some mathematics is included in finer print. The article is directed mostly to those familiar with essential classical mechanics and basic quantum mechanics, though I strive to provide a flavour of the subject to the keenly interested non-physics reader.</description>

      <title>The Toll of the Tolman Effect: On the Status of Classical Temperature in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tolman effect is well-known in relativistic cosmology but rarely discussed outside it. That is surprising because the effect -- that systems extended over a varying gravitational potential exhibit temperature gradients while in thermal equilibrium -- conflicts with ordinary classical thermodynamics. In this paper we try to better understand this effect from a foundational perspective. We make five claims. First, as Tolman knew, it was Einstein who first discovered the effect, and furthermore, Einstein's derivation helps us appreciate how robust it is. Second, the standard interpretation of the effect in terms of 'local temperature' leads to the breakdown of much of classical thermodynamics. Third, one can rescue thermodynamics by using Einstein's preferred interpretation in terms of the 'wahre Temperatur' -- what we'll call global temperature -- but it too has some costs. Fourth, the effect is perhaps best understood in terms of clocks as opposed to energy loss. Fifth, inspired by a proposal of Einstein's elsewhere, we sketch an interpretation of the effect in terms of a third novel temperature, which we call the 'wahre-local temperature'. On this view, temperature -- and thermodynamics -- is defined only in relation to local clocks. In sum, we view the fragmentation of temperature in thermodynamics as a natural and expected result of the fragmentation of time in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Has Anything Changed? Tracking Long-Term Interpretational Preferences in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists' views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave). Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational preferences over the past decades.</description>

      <title>Apples Falling, Buckets Rolling, and Why Inertia Keeps Trolling: Inertial Motion is Not Natural Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertia has long been treated as the paradigm of natural motion. This paper challenges this identification through the lens of General Relativity. Drawing on Norton (2012)'s distinction between idealisation and approximation and analysing key results from Tamir (2012) on the theorems of Geroch-Jang, Ehlers-Geroch, Einstein-Grommer, and Geroch-Traschen, I argue that geodesic motion -- commonly treated as the relativistic expression of inertia -- fails to qualify as either. Rather, geodesic motion is best understood as a useful construct -- a formal artefact of the theory's geometric structure, without real or fictitious instantiation, and excluded by the dynamical structure of General Relativity. In place of inertial motion, I develop a layered account of natural motion, which is not encoded in a single "master equation of motion." Extended, structured, and backreacting bodies require successively refined dynamical formalisms that systematically depart from geodesic motion. This pluralist framework displaces geodesic motion as the privileged expression of pure gravitational motion, replacing it with a dynamically grounded hierarchy of approximations fully consistent with the Einstein field equations. Inertial motion thus emerges not as the universal default of motion under gravity alone, but as a formal construct that stands apart from the pluralistic framework in which natural motion is genuinely realised.</description>
