      <title>Diversity of Parahydrogen-Induced Hyperpolarization Effects in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spin hyperpolarization utilizing parahydrogen (pH2) has broad applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine. This review focuses on examining the less traveled roads associated with parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) leading to MR signal enhancement. We begin with photo-induced PHIP, which allows the investigation of short-lived processes and photo-activated catalysis on timescales as short as microseconds. Next, we review the partially negative line (PNL) effect, in which distinctive lineshape helps to reveal information about rapid exchange with pH2 and the role of short lived catalytic species. The signal enhancement of a single proton in oneH-PHIP is discussed which challenges the underpinning concept of pairwise hydrogenation. Furthermore, we examine metal-free PHIP facilitated by novel molecular tweezers and radicaloids, thereby demonstrating alternative routes to conventional hydrogenation using metal-based catalysts. Although symmetric molecules incorporating pH2 are NMR silent, we showcase methods that reveal hyperpolarized states through post-hydrogenation reactions. Additionally, we discuss chemical exchange processes that mediate polarization transfer between pH2 and a molecular target, expanding the reach of PHIP without synthesizing specialized precursors. We conclude this review by highlighting the role PHIP has played in uncovering the H2 activation mechanisms of hydrogenases. By providing a detailed review of these diverse phenomena, we aim to broaden the understanding and hidden potential of PHIP, which keeps evolving rapidly close to 40 years after its first discovery.</description>

      <title>Addressing limitations of the endpoint slippage analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some rate of oxidation and reduction side-reactions will inevitably coexist in most rechargeable batteries, contributing to reversible and irreversible self-discharge. While parasitic reduction traps electrons, parasitic oxidation donates electrons to the cells inventory and can lead to temporary capacity gain. This causes direct capacity measurements to be an unreliable source of information about the total extent of side-reactions happening in the cell. The most widely used method to determine the rate of these two types of parasitic processes involves analyzing the slippage of endpoints, which consists in tracking the termination of cell charge and discharge when data is represented along a cumulative capacity axis. Here, we argue that this approach could lead to inaccuracies when applied to certain systems, which includes Si electrodes in Li-ion batteries and hard carbon in Na-ion batteries. We analyze this issue in quantitative terms and propose equations that can provide true rates of parasitic processes from experimental endpoint slippage data. This work shows that, in battery science, well-established analytical approaches may not be directly transferrable to new electrode systems.</description>

      <title>Cyclic random graph models predicting giant molecules in hydrocarbon pyrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon pyrolysis is a complex chemical reaction system at extreme temperature and pressure conditions involving large numbers of chemical reactions and chemical species. Only two kinds of atoms are involved: carbons and hydrogens. Its effective description and predictions for new settings are challenging due to the complexity of the system and the high computational cost of generating data by molecular dynamics simulations. On the other hand, the ensemble of molecules present at any moment and the carbon skeletons of these molecules can be viewed as random graphs. Therefore, an adequate random graph model can predict molecular composition at a low computational cost. We propose a random graph model featuring disjoint loops and assortativity correction and a method for learning input distributions from molecular dynamics data. The model uses works of Karrer and Newman (2010) and Newman (2002) as building blocks. We demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the size distribution for small molecules as well as the size distribution of the largest molecule in reaction systems at the pressure of 40.5 GPa, temperature range of 3200K-5000K, and H/C ratio range from 2.25 as in octane through 4 as in methane.</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogate models for particle insertions and element substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two machine learning-aided thermodynamic integration schemes to compute the chemical potentials of atoms and molecules have been developed and compared. One is the particle insertion method, and the other combines particle insertion with element substitution. In the former method, the species is gradually inserted into the liquid, and its chemical potential is computed. In the latter method, after the particle insertion, the inserted species is substituted with another species, and the chemical potential of this new species is computed. In both methods, the thermodynamic integrations are conducted using machine-learned potentials trained on first-principles datasets. The errors of the machine-learned surrogate models are further corrected by performing thermodynamic integrations from the machine-learned potentials to the first-principles potentials, accurately providing the first-principles chemical potentials. These two methods are applied to compute the real potentials of proton, alkali metal cations, and halide anions in water. The applications indicate that these two entirely different thermodynamic pathways yield identical real potentials within statistical error bars, demonstrating that both methods provide reproducible real potentials. The computed real potentials and solvation structures are also in good agreement with past experiments and simulations. These results indicate that machine learning surrogate models enabling the atomic insertion and element substitution provide a precise method for determining the chemical potentials of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete Dusty-Gas Model for the H$_2$--H$_2$O mixture in the anode transport layer of the anode-supported SOFC is considered. An exact conservation law relating the total pressure and hydrogen molar fraction at any point inside the anode to their values in the anode channel is derived. Using this conservation law, approximate analytical solutions for the hydrogen molar fraction and total pressure in the anode transport layer are obtained. The solutions can be used to calculate concentration overpotential.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Equivariant Message Passing Neural Network Model for Non-Local Potential Energy Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have become increasingly successful in atomistic simulations. Many of these potentials are based on an atomistic representation in a local environment, but an efficient description of non-local interactions that exceed a common local environment remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a simple and efficient equivariant model, EquiREANN, to effectively represent non-local potential energy surface. It relies on a physically inspired message passing framework, where the fundamental descriptors are linear combination of atomic orbitals, while both invariant orbital coefficients and the equivariant orbital functions are iteratively updated. We demonstrate that this EquiREANN model is able to describe the subtle potential energy variation due to the non-local structural change with high accuracy and little extra computational cost than an invariant message passing model. Our work offers a generalized approach to create equivariant message passing adaptations of other advanced local many-body descriptors.</description>

      <title>Solid-Liquid Equilibria for the Binary Systems Naphthalene or Biphenyl + 1-Tetradecanol or + 1-Hexadecanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A differential scanning calorimetric technique has been used to obtain solid-liquid equilibrium temperatures for the mixtures naphthalene or biphenyl + 1-tetradecanol, or + 1-hexadecanol. All the systems show a simple eutectic point, whose final composition was determined by means of the Tamman's plots using the needed values of the eutectic heat and of the heat of melting, which are also reported. DISQUAC interaction parameters for the OH/aromatic contacts in the selected systems are given. The present experimental SLE phase diagrams are similarly described by DISQUAC and UNIFAC (Dortmund) models. However, the comparison of DISQUAC and UNIFAC results for systems involving naphthalene and shorter 1-alkanols (methanol-1-octanol) reveals that the temperature dependence of the interaction parameters is more suitable in DISQUAC. The systems are also investigated in terms of the concentration-concentration structure factor. It is shown that the positive deviations from the Raoult's law of the studied solutions become weaker when the homocoordination decreases.</description>

      <title>Finite-Field Cholesky Decomposed Coupled-Cluster Techniques (ff-CD-CC): Theory and Application to Pressure Broadening of Mg by a He Atmosphere and a Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the interpretation of spectra of magnetic stellar objects such as magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) highly accurate quantum chemical predictions for atoms and molecules in finite magnetic field are required. Especially the accurate description of electronically excited states and their properties requires established methods such as those from coupled-cluster (CC) theory. However, respective calculations are computationally challenging even for medium-sized systems. Cholesky decomposition (CD) techniques may be used to alleviate memory bottlenecks. In finite-field computations, the latter are increased due to the reduction of permutational symmetry within the electron-repulsion-integrals (ERIs) as well as the need for complex-valued data types. CD enables a memory-efficient, approximate description of the ERIs with rigorous error control and thus the treatment of larger systems at the CC level becomes feasible. In order to treat molecules in a finite magnetic field (ff), we present in this work the working equations of the left and right-hand side equations for ff-EOM-CD-CCSD for various EOM flavours as well as for the approximate ff-EOM-CD-CC2 method. The methods are applied to the study of the modification of the spectral lines of a magnesium transition by a helium atmosphere that can be found in magnetic WD stars.</description>

      <title>Investigation of real-fluid effects on NH3 oxidation and blending characteristics at supercritical conditions via high-order Virial equation of state coupled with ab initio intermolecular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant efforts have been committed to understanding the fundamental combustion chemistry of ammonia at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions with or without blending with other fuels, as these are promising to improve ammonia combustion performance and reduce NOx emission. A commonly used fundamental reactor is the jet-stirred reactor (JSR). However, modeling of high-pressure JSR experiments have been conducted assuming complete ideal gas behaviors, which might lead to misinterpreted or completely wrong results. Therefore, this study proposes, for the first time, a novel framework coupling high-order Virial equation of state, ab initio multi-body intermolecular potential, and real-fluid governing equations. The framework is further applied to investigate NH3 oxidation under supercritical conditions in jet-stirred reactors, where the real-fluid effects on NH3 oxidation characteristics are quantified and compared, via simulated species profiles and relative changes in simulated mole fractions, at various temperatures, pressures, dilution ratios, equivalence ratios, and with or without blending with H2 and CH4. Strong promoting effects on NH3 oxidation from real-fluid effects are revealed, with significant shifts in simulated species profiles observed for both fuel, intermediates and product species. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted based on the new framework, with diverse influences of real-fluid effects on the contributions of the most sensitive pathways highlighted. It is found that, without considering real-fluid behaviors, the error introduced in simulated species mole fractions can reach 85% at the conditions investigated in this study. Propagation of such levels of error to chemical kinetic mechanisms can disqualify them for any meaningful modeling work. These errors can now be excluded using the framework developed in this study.</description>

      <title>Generalized convolutional many body distribution functional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized many-body distribution functionals as highly compute and data efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atom centered Gaussian electron density proxy distributions weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on pre-defined grids. In the generalized form each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo-lumo gaps, heat-capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9 and VQM24 data sets. The versatility, accuracy, and computational efficiency obtained suggest that cMBDF holds great promise as a crucial ingredient for foundational yet green ML models in the chemical and materials sciences.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Informed Screening for Safer Solvents Used in the Synthesis of Perovskite via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of accurately predicting toxicity of industrial solvents used in perovskite synthesis is a necessary undertaking but is limited by a lack of a targeted and structured toxicity data. This paper presents a novel framework that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction confidence. First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs, while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation. Our novel 'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the quality of the extracted data using the LLM. Next, the extracted data is fed into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict the ED nature of extracted solvents. We have used a Shannon entropy-based uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our predictions. This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual toxicity assessment. Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two specific perovskites.</description>

      <title>On Mixed Quantum/Classical Theory for Rotationally Inelastic Scattering of Identical Collision Partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT) for the treatment of rotationally inelastic transitions during collisions of two identical molecules, described either as indistinguishable or distinguishable partners, is reviewed. The treatment of two molecules as indistinguishable includes symmetrization of rotational wavefunctions, introduces exchange parity, and gives state-to-state transition matrix elements different from those in the straightforward treatment of molecules as distinguishable. Moreover, the treatment of collision partners as indistinguishable is eight times faster. Numerical results, presented for $H_2 + H_2$, CO + CO and $H_2O + H_2O$ systems, indicate good agreement of MQCT calculations with full-quantum calculations from literature and show that an a posteriori correction, applied after the treatment of collision partners as distinguishable, generally produces good results that agree well with the rigorous treatment of collision partners as indistinguishable. This correction for cross section includes either multiplication by 2, or summation over physically indistinguishable processes, depending on the transition type. After this correction, the results of two treatments agree within 5% for most but may reach 10-20% for some transitions. At low collision energies dominated by scattering resonances these differences can be larger, but they tend to decrease as collision energy is increased. It is also shown that if the system is artificially forced to follow the same collision path in the indistinguishable and distinguishable treatments, then all differences between the results of two treatments disappear. This interesting finding gives new insight into the collision process and indicates that indistinguishability of identical collision partners comes into play through the collision path itself, rather than through matrix elements of inelastic transitions.</description>

Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to generate the broadest Raman probe spectrum to our knowledge (spanning -6000 to 0 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>IceCoder: Identification of Ice phases in molecular simulation using variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification and classification of different phases of ice within molecular simulations is a challenging task due to the complex and varied phase space of ice, which includes numerous crystalline and amorphous forms. Traditional order parameters often struggle to differentiate between these phases, especially under conditions of thermal fluctuations. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-based framework, \textit{IceCoder}, which combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor to classify a large number of ice phases effectively. Our approach compresses high-dimensional SOAP vectors into a two-dimensional latent space using VAE, facilitating the visualization and distinction of various ice phases. We trained the model on a comprehensive dataset generated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and demonstrated its ability to accurately detect various phases of crystalline ice as well as liquid water at the molecular level. IceCoder provides a robust and generalizable tool for tracking ice phase transitions in simulations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. This approach may be generalized to detect polymorphs in other molecular crystals as well, leading to new insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying nucleation, growth, and phase transitions, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LIX. High-temperature line list for N$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New hot line lists for five isotopologues of N$_2$O are presented, for the parent $^{14}$N$_2^{16}$O and 4 singly substituted species $^{14}$N$_2^{17}$O, $^{14}$N$_2^{18}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$N$^{16}$O and $^{15}$N$^{14}$N$^{16}$O. The line lists have been computed with the variational program TROVE using a new empirical potential energy surface (PES) and an accurate ab initio dipole moment surface of N$_2$O Ames-1. The PES was obtained by fitting to experimentally derived energies of N$_2$O compiled using the well established MARVEL procedure. Here we also introduce an `artificial symmetry group' $C_{\rm ns}$(AEM) for an efficient construction of rotation-vibrational basis set of a linear non-symmetric triatomic molecule of the XYZ type. The line lists cover the rotational excitations up to $J=160$ and the wavenumber range up to 20000 cm$^{-1}$. MARVEL energies are also used to improve predicted line positions resulting in excellent agreement with the available experimental spectra, as demonstrated. An extensive comparison with existing line lists for N$_2$O HITRAN, HITEMP, NOSL-296, NOSD-1000 and Ames-296K is provided. The line lists are freely accessible from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>On the Nonlinear Excitation of Phononic Frequency Combs in Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical analog of optical frequency combs, phononic frequency combs (PFCs), has recently been demonstrated in mechanical resonators via nonlinear coupling among multiple phonon modes. However, for exciting phononic combs in molecules, the requisite strong nonlinear couplings need not be readily present. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an alternative route for the generation of phononic combs in polar molecules. Theoretically, we investigated the radiation and phononic spectra generated from CO molecule possessing relatively large permanent dipole moment with density matrix formalism. By considering rovibronic excitation of the ground-state CO molecule while avoiding the electronic excitation, the contribution of the permanent dipole moment and electric dipole polarizability to the creation of PFCs is demonstrated and distinguished. The finding could motivate the possible extension of combs to molecular systems to offer new avenues in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>geom2vec: pretrained GNNs as geometric featurizers for conformational dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying informative low-dimensional features that characterize dynamics in molecular simulations remains a challenge, often requiring extensive hand-tuning and system-specific knowledge. Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we learn transferable structural representations that capture molecular geometric patterns without further fine-tuning. We show that the learned representations can be directly used to analyze trajectory data, thus eliminating the need for manual feature selection and improving robustness of the simulation analysis workflows. Importantly, by decoupling GNN training from training for downstream tasks, we enable analysis of larger molecular graphs with limited computational resources.</description>

Abstract: A novel Y-shaped membraneless flow-through electrolyzer is introduced to achieve a homogeneous electrochemical reaction across the entire electrode in a cost-efficient cell design with effective product separation. Numerical simulations of the electrolyte flow and electrical current within the already known I- and T-shaped cells motivate the newly proposed Y-shape cell. Furthermore, a new design criterion is developed based on the balance between bubble removal and gas generation. As proof-of-concept experimental results using the Y-shaped electrolyzer are presented, showing homogeneous gas distributions across the electrode and efficient product separation by the electrolyte flow.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH). In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. The resulting mobility is somewhat higher than that of the relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. However, it is very similar to the mobility obtained from Ehrenfest dynamics, at least in the parameter regimes we have investigated here. This is somewhat surprising because Ehrenfest dynamics overheats the electronic subsystem and is therefore inconsistent with the equilibrium distribution.</description>

Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. A modified Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For H2, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian transport distinguishes three usually equivalent notions of entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend entropy production to a deeply quantum regime involving noncommuting conserved quantities. Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities ("charges") between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulae model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulae. Charges' noncommutation, we find, breaks the formulae's equivalence. Furthermore, different formulae quantify different physical effects of charges' noncommutation on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality - true nonclassicality - by becoming nonreal. This work opens up stochastic thermodynamics to noncommuting - and so particularly quantum - charges.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised identification of crystal defects from atomistic potential descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying crystal defects is vital for unraveling the origins of many physical phenomena. Traditionally used order parameters are system-dependent and can be computationally expensive to calculate for long molecular dynamics simulations. Unsupervised algorithms offer an alternative independent of the studied system and can utilize precalculated atomistic potential descriptors from molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the performance of three such algorithms (PCA, UMAP, and PaCMAP) on silicon and water systems. Initially, we evaluate the algorithms for recognizing phases, including crystal polymorphs and the melt, followed by an extension of our analysis to identify interstitials, vacancies, and interfaces. While PCA is found unsuitable for effective classification, it has been shown to be a suitable initialization for UMAP and PaCMAP. Both UMAP and PaCMAP show promising results overall, with PaCMAP proving more robust in classification, except in cases of significant class imbalance, where UMAP performs better. Notably, both algorithms successfully identify nuclei in supercooled water, demonstrating their applicability to ice nucleation in water.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires treating local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. We present a new ab initio formulation of Green's function embedding which, unlike dynamical mean-field theory that uses non-interacting bath, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) utilizes an efficient real-axis coupled-cluster solver to compute the self-energy, approaching the full system limit at much reduced cost. When combined with the GW theory, GW+ibDET achieves good agreement with experimental spectral properties across a range of semiconducting, insulating and metallic materials. Our approach also enables quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining material properties and addressing the long-standing debate on the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian transition in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects. The spectral peak splitting can also be driven by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, although the underlying mechanism differs from that of dissipation-induced splitting. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. Moreover, we find that spectral features serve as highly sensitive indicators for distinguishing the geometric structures of aggregates, while also unveiling the critical role geometry plays in shaping non-Markovian behavior. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.</description>
