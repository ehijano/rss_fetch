      <title>CBCT scatter correction with dual-layer flat-panel detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Recently, the popularity of dual-layer flat-panel detector (DL-FPD) based dual-energy cone-beam CT (DE-CBCT) imaging has been increasing. However, the image quality of DE-CBCT remains constrained by the Compton scattered X-ray photons.
  Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop an energy-modulated scatter correction method for DL-FPD based CBCT imaging.
  Methods: The DLFPD can measure primary and Compton scattered X-ray photons having dfferent energies: X-ray photons with lower energies are predominantly captured by the top detector layer, while X-ray photons with higher energies are primarily collected by the bottom detector layer. Afterwards, the scattered X-ray signals acquired on both detector layers can be analytically retrieved via a simple model along with several pre-calibrated parameters. Both Monte Carlo simulations and phantom experiments are performed to verify this energy-modulated scatter correction method utilizing DL-FPD.
  Results: Results demonstrate that the proposed energy-modulated scatter correction method can signficantly reduce the shading artifacts of both low-energy and high-energy CBCT images acquired from DL-FPD. On average, the image non-uniformity is reduce by over 77% in the low-energy CBCT image and by over 66% in the high-energy CBCT image. Moreover, the accuracy of the decomposed multi-material results is also substantially improved.
  Conclusion: In the future, Compton scattered X-ray signals can be easily corrected for CBCT systems using DL-FPDs.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness for Deep Learning-based Segmentation of Multi-Center Myocardial Perfusion MRI Datasets Using Data Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Space-time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in software and hardware is an ongoing challenge.
  Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects) were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets (exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations. We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically yields a pixel-wise "uncertainty map" as a byproduct of the segmentation process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically select the "best" one among the pool of solutions.
  Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p &lt; 0.005 for exD-1 and exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with "failed" segmentation was significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs. 17.1%, p &lt; 0.0005).
  Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse sequence, site location or scanner vendor.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radiation Treatment Planning based on Voxel Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation treatment planning involves optimization over a large number of voxels, many of which carry limited information about the clinical problem. We propose an approach to reduce the large optimization problem by only using a representative subset of informative voxels. This way, we drastically improve planning efficiency while maintaining the plan quality. Within an initial probing step, we pre-solve an easier optimization problem involving a simplified objective from which we derive an importance score per voxel. This importance score is then turned into a sampling distribution, which allows us to subsample a small set of informative voxels using importance sampling. By solving a - now reduced - version of the original optimization problem using this subset, we effectively reduce the problem's size and computational demands while accounting for regions where satisfactory dose deliveries are challenging. In contrast to other stochastic (sub-)sampling methods, our technique only requires a single probing and sampling step to define a reduced optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using established solvers without the need of modifying or adapting them. Empirical experiments on open benchmark data highlight substantially reduced optimization times, up to 50 times faster than the original ones, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), all while upholding plan quality comparable to traditional methods. Our novel approach has the potential to significantly accelerate radiation treatment planning by addressing its inherent computational challenges. We reduce the treatment planning time by reducing the size of the optimization problem rather than modifying and improving the optimization method. Our efforts are thus complementary to many previous developments.</description>
