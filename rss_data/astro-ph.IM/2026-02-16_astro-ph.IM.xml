      <title>Astrophysics Wrapped 2025: Year-in-Review of Every Astrophysics arXiv Paper from 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, Astrophysics has experienced an unprecedented increase in research output, as is evident from the year-over-year increase in the number of research papers put onto the arXiv. As a result, keeping up with progress happening outside our respective sub-fields can be exhausting. While it is impossible to be informed on every single aspect of every sub-field, this paper aims to be the next best thing. We present a summary of statistics for every paper uploaded onto the Astrophysics arXiv over the past year - 2025. We analyse a host of metadata ranging from simple metrics like the number of pages and the most used keywords, as well as deeper, more interesting statistics like the distribution of journals to which papers are submitted, the most used telescopes, the most studied astrophysical objects including GW, GRB, FRB events, exoplanets and much more. We also indexed the authors' affiliations to put into context the global distribution of research and collaboration. Combining this data with the citation information of each paper allows us to understand how influential different papers have been on the progress of the field this year. Overall, these statistics highlight the general current state of the field, the hot topics people are working on and the different research communities across the globe and how they function. We also delve into the costs involved in publications and what it means for the community. We hope that this is helpful for both students and professionals alike to adapt their current trajectories to better benefit the field.</description>

      <title>GAMERA-OP: A three-dimensional finite-volume MHD solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GAMERA-OP (Orthogonal-Plus), a three-dimensional finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries. The solver advances magnetic fields using constrained transport to preserve $\nabla\!\cdot\!\mathbf{B}=0$ to machine precision and employs geometry-consistent high-order reconstruction with an enhanced Partial Donor Cell method (e-PDM) that accounts for geometry curvature. Flexible numerics include various numerical fluxes and time integrators. In axial symmetric coordinates, angular momentum are preserved to round-off, and a ring-averaging treatment near the axis relaxes CFL constraints while maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields. Optional capabilities include the semi-relativistic (Boris) correction, background-field splitting, and an anisotropic MHD formulation. Rewritten in C, the code adopts a modular design that simplifies case setup and facilitates the addition of physics modules and coupling to other first-principles codes. Standard benchmarks across multiple geometries verify the code's high accuracy, low numerical diffusion, and robust handling of coordinate singularities and rotating flows. GAMERA-OP provides a practical, high-order framework for space and astrophysical plasma applications where orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and exact angular-momentum conservation are advantageous.</description>

      <title>New Time-Dependent WFC3/IR Inverse Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new time-dependent inverse sensitivities for the WFC3/IR channel. These were calculated using the sensitivity change slopes measured by \citet{2024wfc..rept....6M} and photometry of five CALSPEC standards (the white dwarfs GRW+70~5824, GD~153, GD~71, G191B2B, and the G-type star P330E) collected from 2009 to 2023. The new inverse sensitivities account for losses of 1-2\% over 15 years, depending on wavelength, and provide an internal photometric precision better than 0.5\% for all wide--, medium--, and narrow-band filters. An updated version of \texttt{calwf3} (v3.7.2) has been developed for use with a new time-dependent image photometry table (IMPHTTAB) and will be used to update the image header photometric keywords following MAST reprocessing, expected in late-2024. Alternatively, the new inverse sensitivities may be computed by the user for a specific observation date by running \texttt{stsynphot}.</description>

      <title>Guangqi: A two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic code with realistic equation of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Guangqi, a new two-dimensional, finite-volume radiation hydrodynamics code designed for high-performance astrophysical simulations. The code simultaneously resolves the hydrodynamic equations for complex equations of state (EoS) and implicit radiation transport under the flux-limited diffusion approximation. Written in Fortran and parallelized via the Message Passing Interface. Guangqi supports analytic hydrogen and helium EoS under the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium. The framework is compatible with both Cartesian and spherical-polar geometries -- utilizing non-uniform grid spacing -- and incorporates static (SMR) and adaptive mesh refinement to optimize computational efficiency. To address the inherent challenges of angular momentum conservation in spherical-polar coordinates, we implement a robust and consistent "passive scalar angular momentum algorithm" (PSAMA). Domain decomposition is managed through both Z-order and Hilbert space-filling curves to ensure scalability. The code has been rigorously verified against a suite of standard benchmarks and newly designed test cases specifically intended to diagnose the non-linear coupling between gas dynamics, intricate EoS, radiation transport, and angular momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Murriyang cryogenic phased array feed: spectral-line results and noise-reduction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral-line results from a new cryogenic phased array feed (cryoPAF) on the Murriyang telescope at Parkes are presented. This array offers a significant improvement in field of view, aperture efficiency, bandwidth, chromaticity and survey speed compared with conventional horn-fed receivers. We demonstrate this with measurements of sky calibrators and observations of 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) in the LMC and the nearby galaxy NGC 6744. Within 0.3 deg of the optical axis, the ratio of system temperature to dish aperture efficiency is 25 K and the ratio with beam efficiency is 21 K (at 1.4 GHz). For the previously measured $T_{sys} = 17$ K, respective efficiency values 0.7 and 0.8 are derived. Our HI observational results are in good agreement with previous results, although detailed comparison with multibeam observations of the LMC suggests that the earlier observations may have missed an extended component of low-column-density gas ($8\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$). We use the cryoPAF zoom-band and wideband data to make a preliminary investigation of whether the large number of simultaneous beams (72) permits the use of novel data reduction methods to reduce the effects of foreground/background continuum contamination and RFI. We also investigate if these methods can better protect against signal loss for the detection of faint, extended cosmological signals such as HI intensity maps. Using robust higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, we find encouraging results for the detection of both compact and extended sources, including challenging conditions with high RFI occupancy and significant sky continuum structure. Examples are shown that demonstrate that 3D SVD techniques offer a significant improvement in noise reduction and signal capture compared with more traditional layered 2D techniques.</description>

      <title>ESO White Paper on Intensity Interferometry: Cosmology, Fundamental Physics, Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this whitepaper, we outline how recent technological advances and ongoing developments open qualitatively new science opportunities in cosmology, fundamental physics, and quantum astrophysics. First, intensity interferometry can contribute to one of the most foundational observables in cosmology: the expansion rate of the Universe. Its angular resolution allows it to resolve the angular extent of extragalactic objects such as supernovae or quasars; combined with a physical scale local to the source, this yields an angular diameter distance and hence a 'Hubble diagram'. Second, the nature of dark matter can be probed via the astrometric lensing signatures of tiny dark matter halos. Third, intensity interferometry gives direct access to second-order coherence properties of astrophysical emission, opening a window onto genuinely quantum aspects of astrophysical light.</description>

      <title>CHIME/Slow overview and pilot survey: A new backend to search for second-duration radio transients with the CHIME telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of CHIME/Slow, a real-time transient search backend under development to search for second-duration radio transients using the CHIME telescope, and results obtained from a pilot survey carried out using the prototype version of the search pipeline. The prototype CHIME/Slow pipeline was tested on archival data obtained in December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023 with a total on-sky time of 17 days with an instantaneous Field of View (FoV) of $\sim$13 deg$^2$ . In this pilot survey, we detected nine bursts, one from a new non-repeating source and eight from the known hyperactive repeating source FRB 20220912A. Out of these nine bursts, two bursts from the repeater were not detected by CHIME/FRB, while the non-repeater was detected in the side-lobe of a beam in the CHIME/FRB exhibiting shorter pulse width and narrower bandwidth compared to the CHIME/Slow detection. Here we report properties of the bursts, discuss the sensitivity and completeness of the current version of the CHIME/Slow pipeline, and outline future development to improve its performance. Finally, based on these results, we report the all-sky rate (95% credible region) of radio transients with pulse widths between 16 ms to 5 s, fluence above 5 Jy ms and observing frequency of 600 MHz to be between 184 and 4556 bursts sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Observations of Binary Stars with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope Using Speckle Interferometry: An Attempt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a feasibility study exploring the implementation of optical interferometry and speckle techniques with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at ARIES, which is currently dedicated to photometric observations. Using the sCMOS camera as the DFOT backend, we perform interferometric speckle observations of several binary stars. Standard Speckle Interferometry (SI) algorithms are applied to analyze the recorded data. While this study does not aim to achieve the diffraction limit of DFOT or address a full science-driven resolution case, it serves as a crucial testbed for instrumentation, data acquisition, and analysis of Speckles with DFOT. Notably, we successfully identify and correct tracking-related positional errors in the observed binary systems, demonstrating the viability of the approach. These results provide strong motivation for more systematic observations and future implementation of optical interferometry techniques at meter-class telescopes.</description>

      <title>Photometric classification of supernovae detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility using noise augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), detect far more extragalactic transients than can be spectroscopically classified. Photometric classification offers a scalable alternative, enabling the identification of larger, fainter, and higher-redshift supernova samples suitable for applications such as Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology. We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Our approach utilises the autoencoder architecture of ParSNIP (Boone 2021) to capture the intrinsic diversity of SN light curves. We trained the model on a spectroscopically classified ZTF SN sample, incorporating a realistic noise augmentation procedure that simulates the flux uncertainties of fainter sources. Light curve features were used to train a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier, implemented in both binary (SN Ia vs. non-Ia) and multi-class configurations. We validated our classifier on independent, fainter ZTF data with and without noise augmentation. To evaluate real-time performance, we also applied our classifier to live ZTF alerts and conducted a spectroscopic classification survey within the ePESSTO+ collaboration. We found that noise augmentation significantly improves classification performance, particularly for fainter sources. Our binary classifier achieves an SN Ia recall of (98.1 $\pm$ 0.4)%, averaged across five train-test splits. SN Ia recall exceeds 98% for events with a peak apparent magnitude up to 20 and more than 10 detections, and remains above 96% up to magnitude 20.5. Overall, 95% of sources were correctly classified in both binary and multi-class modes. Our classifier performs efficiently on real ZTF data and enables construction of a large photometric SN Ia sample for cosmology.</description>

      <title>TSSC comet-centered data products from TESS 3I/ATLAS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) made dedicated observations of 3I/ATLAS between 15 -- 22 January 2026 (Sector 1751), capturing high-cadence observations at 200s and 20s cadence. We present two High Level Science Products (HLSPs): (1) comet-centered image time series, corrected for background scattered light and stars; and (2) aperture light curves extracted from the corrected images. We created these data products using the official TESS products and they are publicly available at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). TESS's high-precision, near-continuous photometry will provide unique insights into the comet's activity following its closest approach to the Sun. The TESS Science Support Center (TSSC) has created these data products to facilitate scientific analyses by the TESS and Solar System communities.</description>

      <title>Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Diagnostics for Interstellar PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diagnostics rely on empirical band ratios, which often suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias. We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Bundle adjustment of Hayabusa2's ONC images and controlled color mosaic map of Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JAXA's Hayabusa2 mission successfully returned samples from the asteroid Ryugu in December 2020. It executed two touchdowns to collect the surface and subsurface materials, one close to the crater created by an artificial impactor. The onboard camera system, Optical Navigation Camera (ONC), with two wide-angle cameras and one narrow-angle camera with seven color filters, was crucial for mapping geomorphology and composition such as hydrated minerals during navigation and scientific observation. More than 8,300 images revealed Ryugu's spinning-top shape and boulder-covered surface. However, most high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations lacked precise location data and camera position/orientation information. Image geometry was refined using photogrammetric bundle adjustment. This method enabled the refinement of all high-resolution images captured during descent/touchdown operations. Furthermore, map-projected GeoTIFF images in GIS format containing geographic metadata were created for all ONC images, and these were integrated to construct global and regional mosaic maps. To facilitate scientific research on Ryugu, these refined image geometry information, maps, and mosaics are publicly available via https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WW3IH0</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Prediction of Infrared Spectra of Interstellar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as the primary contributors to the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) widely observed in space. However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis.</description>

      <title>Statistics of time and frequency-averaged spectra in gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis from gravitational-wave detectors often relies on the assumption that time chunks, or frequency bins, are uncorrelated. We discuss the validity of this approximation in the context of searches for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. We examine the impact of averaging over time and frequency, a reduction technique commonly employed to minimize the computational expense of likelihood evaluations. We introduce an analytical tool based on Fisher information to quantify the error in parameter inference arising from ignoring these effects. Finally, we address the issue of locally stationary processes and optimal time chunking.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Hunter for Alerts (AHA): Anomaly Detection in the ZTF Transient Alert Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.</description>

      <title>NuRadioMC: Simulating the radio emission of neutrinos from interaction to detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.01670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NuRadioMC is a Monte Carlo framework designed to simulate ultra-high energy neutrino detectors that rely on the radio detection method. This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed. Comprehensive examples are used to discuss the capabilities of the code and different aspects of instrumental design decisions.</description>

      <title>The Case for Space: Estimating Precise Time Delays from Ground- and Space-Based Observations of Lensed Supernovae with Glimpse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>LISA Non-Linear Dynamics and Tilt-To-Length Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the LISA mission, Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the dominant instrumental noise contributions after laser frequency noise is suppressed based, on assumptions on the size of the coupling and angular jitter levels. This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.</description>

      <title>SKA-Low simulations for a cosmic dawn/epoch of reionisation deep field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic simulation of an SKA-Low cosmic dawn/epoch of reionisation (CD/EoR) observation, which can be used to further the development of foreground-mitigation approaches. The simulation corresponds to a deep (1000 h) integration pointing over the 106 MHz-196 MHz frequency range. The sky components include the CD/EoR signal, extragalactic foreground emission featuring strong (over 5 Jy at 150 MHz) out-of-field sources and in-field sources down to 1 microJy at 150 MHz, and Galactic emission from the GSM2016 model complemented with small-scales structure beyond its native $\sim 1$ deg resolution from a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of the interstellar medium. Modeled errors include a partial de-mixing of the out-of-field sources, direction-dependent calibration errors leading to residual ionospheric effects, and direction-independent gain calibration errors, on top of thermal noise. Simulated observations are delivered as visibilities as well as imaging products with natural weighting. The true, uncorrupted, CD/EoR signal is also delivered, to allow an assessment of the efficacy of foreground-mitigation approaches. The codes used to generate these simulations are also delivered, so that new simulated datasets can be produced. This simulation has been the basis for the SKA Science Data Challenge 3a (SDC3a), which addressed foreground removal.</description>

      <title>Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01540v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how intensive, large and accurate time series can allow us to see through time. Many phenomena have aperiodic and periodic components. An ideal time series analysis method would detect such trend and signal(-s) combinations. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations constraining the trend and signal(-s) detection. We show that none of those limitations constrains our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) which can detect signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): ``For any sample window $\Delta T$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $\sigma$ increase.'' The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The DCM can forecast complex time series. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test. Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series. In our appendix, we show that DCM can model and forecast El Ni\~no.</description>

      <title>Towards an anomaly detection pipeline for gravitational waves at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</description>

Abstract: Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO), a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler &amp; Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.</description>

      <title>Direct power spectral density estimation from structure functions without Fourier transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order structure functions and power spectral densities are popular tools in the study of statistical properties across scales, particularly for the analysis of turbulent flows. Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.</description>

Abstract: We present sensipy, an open-source Python toolkit for simulating observations of transient astrophysical sources, particularly in the high-energy (HE, keV-GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, GeV-TeV) gamma-ray ranges. The most explosive events in our universe are often short-lived, emitting the bulk of their energy in a relatively narrow time window. Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms. This information can further help to justify the feasibility of proposed observations, estimate detection rates (events/year) for various classes of sources, and provide scheduling insight in realtime during gamma-ray and multi-messenger observational campaigns.</description>
