      <title>Efficient Framework for Solving Plasma Waves with Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma, which constitutes 99\% of the visible matter in the universe, is characterized by a wide range of waves and instabilities that play a pivotal role in space physics, astrophysics, laser-plasma interactions, fusion research, and laboratory experiments. The linear physics of these phenomena is described by kinetic dispersion relations (KDR). However, solving KDRs for arbitrary velocity distributions remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Maxwellian distributions frequently observed in various plasma environments. This work introduces a novel, efficient, and unified numerical framework to address this challenge. The proposed method rapidly and accurately yields all significant solutions of KDRs for nearly arbitrary velocity distributions, supporting both unstable and damped modes across all frequencies and wavevectors. The approach expands plasma species' velocity distribution functions using a series of carefully chosen orthogonal basis functions and employs a highly accurate rational approximation to transform the problem into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem, eliminating the need for initial guesses. The efficiency and versatility of this framework are demonstrated, enabling simplified studies of plasma waves with arbitrary distributions. This advancement paves the way for uncovering new physics in natural plasma environments, such as spacecraft observations in space plasmas, and applications like wave heating in fusion research.</description>

      <title>BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD "Rome" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Observation and modeling of complex transient structure in heliosphere followed by geomagnetic storm on May 10-11, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex CME/ICME structures in the solar wind often arising in the heliosphere as a result of interaction between two or more CMEs are very important due to their enhanced geoefficiency, but their modeling is difficult due to lack of observational data outside the solar corona. The outstanding evidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the strongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged from the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the series triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to consider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at three stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle heliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS observations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables to build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with enhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the heliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone base were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of 20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position corresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the modeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric distance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may characterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME interaction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1 position agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed expansion model.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($&lt;0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation, and thus a significantly longer forecast time than the traditional method.</description>
