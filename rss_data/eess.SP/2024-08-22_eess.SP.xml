      <title>Online Electric Vehicle Charging Detection Based on Memory-based Transformer using Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses unique challenges for grid operators and infrastructure, which requires effectively managing these vehicles' integration into the grid. Identification of EVs charging is essential to electricity Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) for better planning and managing the distribution grid. One critical aspect is the ability to accurately identify the presence of EV charging in the grid. EV charging identification using smart meter readings obtained from behind-the-meter devices is a challenging task that enables effective managing the integration of EVs into the existing power grid. Different from the existing supervised models that require addressing the imbalance problem caused by EVs and non-EVs data, we propose a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) that can run in real-time (online) to detect EVs charging from a streaming smart meter. It dynamically leverages coarse-scale historical information using an M-TR encoder from an extended global temporal window, in conjunction with an M-TR decoder that concentrates on a limited time frame, local window, aiming to capture the fine-scale characteristics of the smart meter data. The M-TR is based on an anomaly detection technique that does not require any prior knowledge about EVs charging profiles, nor it does only require real power consumption data of non-EV users. In addition, the proposed model leverages the power of transfer learning. The M-TR is compared with different state-of-the-art methods and performs better than other unsupervised learning models. The model can run with an excellent execution time of 1.2 sec. for 1-minute smart recordings.</description>

      <title>MAC protocol classification in the ISM band using machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of new technologies and a growing number of wireless networks, we face the problem of radio spectrum shortages. As a result, identifying the wireless channel spectrum to exploit the channel's idle state while also boosting network security is a pivotal issue. Detecting and classifying protocols in the MAC sublayer enables Cognitive Radio users to improve spectrum utilization and minimize potential interference. In this paper, we classify the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols, which are the most widely used MAC sublayer protocols in the ISM radio band. With the advent of various wireless technologies, especially in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, the ISM frequency spectrum has become crowded and high-traffic, which faces a lack of spectrum resources and user interference. Therefore, identifying and classifying protocols is an effective and useful method. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, known for their advanced classification capabilities, we apply Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, which are machine learning algorithms, to classify protocols into three classes: Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Beacon, and Bluetooth. To capture the signals, we use the USRP N210 Software Defined Radio device and sample the real data in the indoor environment in different conditions of the presence and absence of transmitters and receivers for these two protocols. By assembling this dataset and studying the time and frequency features of the protocols, we extract the frame width and the silence gap between the two frames as time features and the PAPR of each frame as a power feature. By comparing the output of the protocols classification in different conditions and also adding Gaussian noise, it was found that the samples in the nonlinear SVM method with RBF and KNN functions have the best performance, with 97.83% and 98.12% classification accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distributed Noncoherent Joint Transmission Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dense Small Cell MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dense small cell (DSC) network where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) transmit data to single-antenna users over a shared frequency band. To enhance capacity, a state-of-the-art technique known as noncoherent joint transmission (JT) is applied, enabling users to receive data from multiple coordinated SBSs. However, the sum rate maximization problem with noncoherent JT is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. While existing optimization-based noncoherent JT algorithms can provide near-optimal performance, they require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, which makes them difficult to be implemeted in DSC networks.To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem.The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions.By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate.In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Micro-Doppler Signature Representation Method Based on Joint Boulic-Sinusoidal Pendulum Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the help of micro-Doppler signature, ultra-wideband (UWB) through-the-wall radar (TWR) enables the reconstruction of range and velocity information of limb nodes to accurately identify indoor human activities. However, existing methods are usually trained and validated directly using range-time maps (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTM), which have high feature redundancy and poor generalization ability. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a human activity micro-Doppler signature representation method based on joint Boulic-sinusoidal pendulum motion model. In detail, this paper presents a simplified joint Boulic-sinusoidal pendulum human motion model by taking head, torso, both hands and feet into consideration improved from Boulic-Thalmann kinematic model. The paper also calculates the minimum number of key points needed to describe the Doppler and micro-Doppler information sufficiently. Both numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. The results demonstrate that the proposed number of key points of micro-Doppler signature can precisely represent the indoor human limb node motion characteristics, and substantially improve the generalization capability of the existing methods for different testers.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Feasibility of Automated Data Standardization using Large Language Models for Seamless Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a feasibility study for real-time automated data standardization leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance seamless positioning systems in IoT environments. By integrating and standardizing heterogeneous sensor data from smartphones, IoT devices, and dedicated systems such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB), our study ensures data compatibility and improves positioning accuracy using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The core components include the Intelligent Data Standardization Module (IDSM), which employs a fine-tuned LLM to convert varied sensor data into a standardized format, and the Transformation Rule Generation Module (TRGM), which automates the creation of transformation rules and scripts for ongoing data standardization. Evaluated in real-time environments, our study demonstrates adaptability and scalability, enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy in seamless navigation. This study underscores the potential of advanced LLMs in overcoming sensor data integration complexities, paving the way for more scalable and precise IoT navigation solutions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing Between Low Earth Orbit Satellite and Terrestrial Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Perspective Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks with mega constellations have the potential to provide 5G and beyond services ubiquitously. However, these networks may introduce mutual interference to both satellite and terrestrial networks, particularly when sharing spectrum resources. In this paper, we present a system-level performance analysis to address these interference issues using the tool of stochastic geometry. We model the spatial distributions of satellites, satellite users, terrestrial base stations (BSs), and terrestrial users using independent Poisson point processes on the surfaces of concentric spheres. Under these spatial models, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency of uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) satellite networks when they share spectrum with both UL and DL terrestrial networks. These derived ergodic expressions capture comprehensive network parameters, including the densities of satellite and terrestrial networks, the path-loss exponent, and fading. From our analysis, we determine the conditions under which spectrum sharing with UL terrestrial networks is advantageous for both UL and DL satellite networks. Our key finding is that the optimal spectrum sharing configuration among the four possible configurations depends on the density ratio between terrestrial BSs and users, providing a design guideline for spectrum management. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our derived expressions.</description>

      <title>New Collision Free Balanced Frequency Hopping Sequence Sets: Construction and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision-free Frequency Hopping Sequences (FHS) are crucial for maintaining the throughput of Frequency Hopping Multiple Access (FHMA) communication systems. When multiple FHS deployed in the same geographical area hop into the same frequency spot or location, it can result in multiple access interference (MAI), leading to performance degradation of the co-habiting FHMA systems. Orthogonal FHS (O-FHS) could be used to avoid such collisions even while maintaining the pseudo-random hopping property. We propose a new Collision-Free Balanced Frequency Hopping Sequence (CFB-FHS) set based on $GF(p)$. The proposed algorithm generates a significantly longer O-FHS and ensures full-band hopping and uniform usage of all the available frequency spots, even while preserving the pseudo-random nature of the sequences. The Hamming correlation and these related properties of the proposed sequence set are analyzed and compared with the existing sequence sets. The length of this CFB-FHS can be chosen based on the application requirements, and once selected, the length remains fixed irrespective of the family size of the sequence set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient deployment and operation of any wireless communication ecosystem rely on knowledge of the received signal quality over the target coverage area. This knowledge is typically acquired through radio propagation solvers, which however suffer from intrinsic and well-known performance limitations. This article provides a primer on how integrating deep learning and conventional propagation modeling techniques can enhance multiple vital facets of wireless network operation, and yield benefits in terms of efficiency and reliability. By highlighting the pivotal role that the deep learning-based radio propagation models will assume in next-generation wireless networks, we aspire to propel further research in this direction and foster their adoption in additional applications.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces as Spatial Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is typically based on treating the RIS as an infinitely large surface that steers incident plane waves toward the desired direction. In practical implementations, however, the RIS has finite size and the incident wave is a beam of finite $k$-content, rather than a plane wave of $\delta$-like $k$-content. To understand the implications of the finite extent of both the RIS and the incident beam, here we treat the RIS as a spatial filter, the transfer function of which is determined by both the prescribed RIS operation and the shape of the RIS boundary. Following this approach, we study how the RIS transforms the incident $k$-content and we demonstrate how, by engineering the RIS shape, size, and response, it is possible to shape beams with nontrivial $k$-content to suppress unwanted interference, while concentrating the reflected power to desired directions. We also demonstrate how our framework, when applied in the context of near-field communications, provides the necessary insights into how the wavefront of the beam is tailored to enable focusing, propagation with invariant profile, and bending, beyond conventional beamforming.</description>

      <title>Fast Burst-Sparsity Learning Approach for Massive MIMO-OTFS Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations is challenging due to high-dimensional sparse representation (SR). Existing methods often face performance degradation and/or high computational complexity. To address these issues and exploit intricate channel sparsity structure, this letter first leverages a novel hybrid burst-sparsity prior to capture the burst/common sparse structure in the angle/delay domain, and then utilizes an independent variational Bayesian inference (VBI) factorization technique to efficiently solve the high-dimensional SR problem. Additionally, an angle/Doppler refinement approach is incorporated into the proposed method to automatically mitigate off-grid mismatches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been utilized for optimizing wireless communications due to its ability to detect the environment. This paper explores the use of LiDAR in channel estimation for wideband multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems and introduces a LiDAR-enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) learning network (LE-CLN). By utilizing user positioning information, LE-CLN first calculates user-localized over-complete angular measurements. It then investigates the correlation between LiDAR and CSI, transforming raw LiDAR data into a low-complexity format embedded with signal propagation characteristics. LE-CLN also adapts the use of LiDAR based on channel conditions through attention mechanisms. Thanks to the unique wireless features offered by LiDAR, LE-CLN achieves higher estimation accuracy and spectrum efficiency compared to benchmarks, particularly in latency-sensitive applications where pilot transmissions are expected to be reduced.</description>

      <title>MicroXercise: A Micro-Level Comparative and Explainable System for Remote Physical Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent global estimates suggest that as many as 2.41 billion individuals have health conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation services. Home-based Physical Therapy (PT) faces significant challenges in providing interactive feedback and meaningful observation for therapists and patients. To fill this gap, we present MicroXercise, which integrates micro-motion analysis with wearable sensors, providing therapists and patients with a comprehensive feedback interface, including video, text, and scores. Crucially, it employs multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and attribution-based explainable methods to analyze the existing deep learning neural networks in monitoring exercises, focusing on a high granularity of exercise. This synergistic approach is pivotal, providing output matching the input size to precisely highlight critical subtleties and movements in PT, thus transforming complex AI analysis into clear, actionable feedback. By highlighting these micro-motions in different metrics, such as stability and range of motion, MicroXercise significantly enhances the understanding and relevance of feedback for end-users. Comparative performance metrics underscore its effectiveness over traditional methods, such as a 39% and 42% improvement in Feature Mutual Information (FMI) and Continuity. MicroXercise is a step ahead in home-based physical therapy, providing a technologically advanced and intuitively helpful solution to enhance patient care and outcomes.</description>

      <title>Modular Hypernetworks for Scalable and Adaptive Deep MIMO Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) were shown to facilitate the operation of uplink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers, with emerging architectures augmenting modules of classic receiver processing. Current designs consider static DNNs, whose architecture is fixed and weights are pre-trained. This induces a notable challenge, as the resulting MIMO receiver is suitable for a given configuration, i.e., channel distribution and number of users, while in practice these parameters change frequently with network variations and users leaving and joining the network. In this work, we tackle this core challenge of DNN-aided MIMO receivers. We build upon the concept of hypernetworks, augmenting the receiver with a pre-trained deep model whose purpose is to update the weights of the DNN-aided receiver upon instantaneous channel variations. We design our hypernetwork to augment modular deep receivers, leveraging their modularity to have the hypernetwork adapt not only the weights, but also the architecture. Our modular hypernetwork leads to a DNN-aided receiver whose architecture and resulting complexity adapts to the number of users, in addition to channel variations, without retraining. Our numerical studies demonstrate superior error-rate performance of modular hypernetworks in time-varying channels compared to static pre-trained receivers, while providing rapid adaptivity and scalability to network variations.</description>

      <title>R-STELLAR: A Resilient Synthesizable Signature Attenuation SCA Protection on AES-256 with built-in Attack-on-Countermeasure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Side channel attacks (SCAs) remain a significant threat to the security of cryptographic systems in modern embedded devices. Even mathematically secure cryptographic algorithms, when implemented in hardware, inadvertently leak information through physical side channel signatures such as power consumption, electromagnetic (EM) radiation, light emissions, and acoustic emanations. Exploiting these side channels significantly reduces the search space of the attacker. In recent years, physical countermeasures have significantly increased the minimum traces to disclosure (MTD) to 1 billion. Among them, signature attenuation is the first method to achieve this mark. Signature attenuation often relies on analog techniques, and digital signature attenuation reduces MTD to 20 million, requiring additional methods for high resilience. We focus on improving the digital signature attenuation by an order of magnitude (MTD 200M). Additionally, we explore possible attacks against signature attenuation countermeasure. We introduce a Voltage drop Linear region Biasing (VLB) attack technique that reduces the MTD to over 2000 times less than the previous threshold. This is the first known attack against a physical side-channel attack (SCA) countermeasure. We have implemented an attack detector with a response time of 0.8 milliseconds to detect such attacks, limiting SCA leakage window to sub-ms, which is insufficient for a successful attack.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Block-Controlled RIS: Bridging the Performance Gap to Element-Controlled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) requires numerous elements to achieve adequate array gain, which linearly increases power consumption (PC) with the number of reflection phases. To address this, this letter introduces a rotatable block-controlled RIS (BC-RIS) that preserves spectral efficiency (SE) while reducing power costs. Unlike the element-controlled RIS (EC-RIS), which necessitates independent phase control for each element, the BC-RIS uses a single phase control circuit for each block, substantially lowering power requirements. In the maximum ratio transmission, by customizing specular reflection channels through the rotation of blocks and coherently superimposing signals with optimized reflection phase of blocks, the BC-RIS achieves the same averaged SE as the EC-RIS. To counteract the added power demands from rotation, influenced by block size, we have developed a segmentation scheme to minimize overall PC. Furthermore, constraints for rotation power-related parameters have been established to enhance the energy efficiency of the BC-RIS compared to the EC-RIS. Numerical results confirm that this approach significantly improves energy efficiency while maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>Recording Brain Activity While Listening to Music Using Wearable EEG Devices Combined with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are crucial for investigating brain function and cognitive processes. This study aims to address the challenges of efficiently recording and analyzing high-dimensional EEG signals while listening to music to recognize emotional states. We propose a method combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for EEG signal processing. Using wearable EEG devices, we collected brain activity data from participants listening to music. The data was preprocessed, segmented, and Differential Entropy (DE) features were extracted. We then constructed and trained a Bi-LSTM model to enhance key feature extraction and improve emotion recognition accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the SEED and DEAP datasets. The Bi-LSTM-AttGW model achieved 98.28% accuracy on the SEED dataset and 92.46% on the DEAP dataset in multi-class emotion recognition tasks, significantly outperforming traditional models such as SVM and EEG-Net. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms, providing robust technical support for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and affective computing. Future work will focus on improving device design, incorporating multimodal data, and further enhancing emotion recognition accuracy, aiming to achieve practical applications in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Channel Prediction in Wideband Massive MIMO Systems with Small Overhead for Online Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel prediction compensates for outdated channel state information in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been implemented to design channel predictors by leveraging the temporal correlation of wireless channels. However, most ML-based channel prediction techniques have only considered offline training when generating channel predictors, which can result in poor performance when encountering channel environments different from the ones they were trained on. To ensure prediction performance in varying channel conditions, we propose an online re-training framework that trains the channel predictor from scratch to effectively capture and respond to changes in the wireless environment. The training time includes data collection time and neural network training time, and should be minimized for practical channel predictors. To reduce the training time, especially data collection time, we propose a novel ML-based channel prediction technique called aggregated learning (AL) approach for wideband massive MIMO systems. In the proposed AL approach, the training data can be split and aggregated either in an array domain or frequency domain, which are the channel domains of MIMO-OFDM systems. This processing can significantly reduce the time for data collection. Our numerical results show that the AL approach even improves channel prediction performance in various scenarios with small training time overhead.</description>

      <title>Empowering Over-the-Air Personalized Federated Learning via RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) integrates analog communication with task-oriented computation, serving as a key enabling technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. However, AirComp-enabled FL (AirFL) with a single global consensus model fails to address the data heterogeneity in real-life FL scenarios with non-independent and identically distributed local datasets. In this paper, we introduce reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to enable efficient personalized AirFL, mitigating the data heterogeneity issue. First, we achieve statistical interference elimination across different clusters in the personalized AirFL framework via RIS phase shift configuration. Then, we propose two personalized aggregation schemes involving power control and denoising factor design from the perspectives of first- and second-order moments, respectively, to enhance the FL convergence. Numerical results validate the superior performance of our proposed schemes over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Fast Iterative ELAA-MIMO Detection Exploiting Static Channel Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture array (ELAA) is a promising multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique for next generation mobile networks. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to accelerate the convergence of current iterative MIMO detectors in ELAA channels. Our approaches exploit the static components of the ELAA channel, which include line of sight (LoS) paths and deterministic non-LoS (NLoS) components due to channel hardening effects. This paper proposes novel convergence acceleration techniques for fast iterative ELAA-MIMO detection by leveraging the static channel component, including the LoS paths and deterministic NLoS components that arise due to channel hardening. Specifically, these static channel components are utilized in two ways: as preconditioning matrices for general iterative algorithms, and as initialization for quasi-Newton (QN) methods. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches converge significantly faster compared to current iterative MIMO detectors, especially under strong LoS conditions with high Rician K-factor. Furthermore, QN methods with the proposed initialization matrix consistently achieve the best convergence performance while maintaining low complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we analyze the performance of mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions approach, which can improve the performance of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CF mMIMO-OFDM) systems under asynchronous reception. To this end, we first obtain the achievable downlink sum-rate for the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions, and then provide a closed-form expression for the case with the maximum ratio precoding. Subsequently, an efficient clustering algorithm is proposed to group access points into different clusters with the same quantized phase shift in each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions can effectively improve the sum-rate of CF mMIMO-OFDM systems under asynchronous reception.</description>

      <title>Age and Value of Information Optimization for Systems with Multi-Class Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Received samples of a stochastic process are processed by a server for delivery as updates to a monitor. Each sample belongs to a class that specifies a distribution for its processing time and a function that describes how the value of the processed update decays with age at the monitor. The class of a sample is identified when the processed update is delivered. The server implements a form of M/G/1/1 blocking queue; samples arriving at a busy server are discarded and samples arriving at an idle server are subject to an admission policy that depends on the age and class of the prior delivered update. For the delivered updates, we characterize the average age of information (AoI) and average value of information (VoI). We derive the optimal stationary policy that minimizes the convex combination of the AoI and (negative) VoI. It is shown that the policy has a threshold structure, in which a new sample is allowed to arrive to the server only if the previous update's age and value difference surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the specifics of the value function and system statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilized the Tempotron, a robust classifier based on a third-generation neural network model, for pulse shape discrimination. By eliminating the need for manual feature extraction, the Tempotron model can process pulse signals directly, generating discrimination results based on prior knowledge. The study performed experiments using GPU acceleration, resulting in over 500 times faster compared to the CPU-based model, and investigated the impact of noise augmentation on the Tempotron performance. Experimental results substantiated that Tempotron serves as a formidable classifier, adept at accomplishing high discrimination accuracy on both AmBe and time-of-flight PuBe datasets. Furthermore, analyzing the neural activity of Tempotron during training shed light on its learning characteristics and aided in selecting its hyperparameters. Moreover, the study addressed the constraints and potential avenues for future development in utilizing the Tempotron for pulse shape discrimination. The dataset used in this study and the GPU-based Tempotron are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/TempotronGPU.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variational Autoencoders for Parameterized MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose to use a variational autoencoder-based framework for parameterizing a conditional linear minimum mean squared error estimator. The variational autoencoder models the underlying unknown data distribution as conditionally Gaussian, yielding the conditional first and second moments of the estimand, given a noisy observation. The derived estimator is shown to approximate the minimum mean squared error estimator by utilizing the variational autoencoder as a generative prior for the estimation problem. We propose three estimator variants that differ in their access to ground-truth data during the training and estimation phases. The proposed estimator variant trained solely on noisy observations is particularly noteworthy as it does not require access to ground-truth data during training or estimation. We conduct a rigorous analysis by bounding the difference between the proposed and the minimum mean squared error estimator, connecting the training objective and the resulting estimation performance. Furthermore, the resulting bound reveals that the proposed estimator entails a bias-variance tradeoff, which is well-known in the estimation literature. As an example application, we portray channel estimation, allowing for a structured covariance matrix parameterization and low-complexity implementation. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is not limited to channel estimation but can be applied to a broad class of estimation problems. Extensive numerical simulations first validate the theoretical analysis of the proposed variational autoencoder-based estimators and then demonstrate excellent estimation performance compared to related classical and machine learning-based state-of-the-art estimators.</description>

Abstract: The advancements in nanotechnology, material science, and electrical engineering have shrunk the sizes of electronic devices down to the micro/nanoscale. This brings the opportunity of developing the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT). With nanodevices, numerous new possibilities emerge in the biomedical, military fields, and industrial products. However, a continuous energy supply is mandatory for these devices to work. At the micro/nanoscale, batteries cannot supply this demand due to size limitations and the limited energy contained in the batteries. Internet of Harvester Nano Things (IoHNT), a concept of Energy Harvesting (EH) integrated with wireless power transmission (WPT) techniques, converts the existing different energy sources into electrical energy and transmits to IoNT nodes. As IoHNTs are not directly attached to IoNTs, it gives flexibility in size. However, we define the size of IoHNTs as up to 10 cm. In this review, we comprehensively investigate the available energy sources and EH principles to wirelessly power IoNTs. We discuss the IoHNT principles, material selections, and state-of-the-art applications of each energy source for different sectoral applications. The different technologies of WPT and how communication is influenced by the incorporation of IoHNTs to power IoNTs are discussed with the future research directions. IoHNTs represent a shift in the nanodevice power supply, leading us towards a future where wireless technology is widespread. Hence, it will motivate researchers to envision and contribute to advancing the following power revolution in IoNT, providing unmatched simplicity and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to estimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances within this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the efficacy of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Integrating device-to-device (D2D) communication into cellular networks can significantly reduce the transmission burden on base stations (BSs). Besides, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless networks. In this work, we consider a full-duplex ISAC- based D2D underlaid system, and propose a joint beamforming and power allocation scheme to improve the performance of the coexisting ISAC and D2D networks. To enhance spectral efficiency, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for the full-duplex ISAC-based D2D underlaid system, which is non-convex. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm and prove its convergence. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with the iterative algorithm, demonstrating that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>

Abstract: This project describes the application of the technologies of Machine Learning and Internet-of-Things to assess the lower limb strength of individuals undergoing rehabilitation or therapy. Specifically, it seeks to measure and assess the progress of individuals by sensors attached to chairs and processing the data through Google GPU Tensorflow CoLab. Pressure sensors are attached to various locations on a chair, including but not limited to the seating area, backrest, hand rests, and legs. Sensor data from the individual performing both sit-to-stand transition and stand-to-sit transition provides a time series dataset regarding the pressure distribution and vibratory motion on the chair. The dataset and timing information can then be fed into a machine learning model to estimate the relative strength and weakness during various phases of the movement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much work has been done on processing of wireless spectrum data involving machine learning techniques in domain-related problems for cognitive radio networks, such as anomaly detection, modulation classification, technology classification and device fingerprinting. Most of the solutions are based on labeled data, created in a controlled manner and processed with supervised learning approaches. However, spectrum data measured in real-world environment is highly nondeterministic, making its labeling a laborious and expensive process, requiring domain expertise, thus being one of the main drawbacks of using supervised learning approaches in this domain. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for exploring spectrum activities in a real-world unlabeled data. In particular, we compare the performance of two SSL models, one based on a reference DeepCluster architecture and one adapted for spectrum activity identification and clustering, and a baseline model based on K-means clustering algorithm. We show that SSL models achieve superior performance regarding the quality of extracted features and clustering performance. With SSL models we achieve reduction of the feature vectors size by two orders of magnitude, while improving the performance by a factor of 2 to 2.5 across the evaluation metrics, supported by visual assessment. Additionally we show that adaptation of the reference SSL architecture to the domain data provides reduction of model complexity by one order of magnitude, while preserving or even improving the clustering performance.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Expectation Propagation MIMO Detection via Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for symbol detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The EP detector shows excellent performance but suffers from a high computational complexity due to the matrix inversion, required in each EP iteration to perform marginal inference on a Gaussian system. We propose an inversion-free variant of the EP algorithm by treating inference on the mean and variance as two separate and simpler subtasks: We study the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for obtaining the mean, which can significantly reduce the complexity and increase stability by relying on the Jacobi preconditioner that proves to fit the EP characteristics very well. For the variance, we use a simple approximation based on linear regression of the Gram channel matrix. Numerical studies on the Rayleigh-fading channel and on a realistic 3GPP channel model reveal the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which offers an attractive performance-complexity tradeoff and even outperforms the original EP detector in high multi-user inference cases where the matrix inversion becomes numerically unstable.</description>

      <title>Real-time Event Recognition of Long-distance Distributed Vibration Sensing with Knowledge Distillation and Hardware Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber-optic sensing, especially distributed optical fiber vibration (DVS) sensing, is gaining importance in internet of things (IoT) applications, such as industrial safety monitoring and intrusion detection. Despite their wide application, existing post-processing methods that rely on deep learning models for event recognition in DVS systems face challenges with real-time processing of large sample data volumes, particularly in long-distance applications. To address this issue, we propose to use a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with ResNet as the teacher model for knowledge distillation. This results in a significant improvement in accuracy, from 83.41% to 95.39%, on data from previously untrained environments. Additionally, we propose a novel hardware design based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to further accelerate model inference. This design replaces multiplication with binary shift operations and quantizes model weights, enabling high parallelism and low latency. Our implementation achieves an inference time of 0.083 ms for a spatial-temporal sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length and 0.256 s time frame. This performance enables real-time signal processing over approximately 38.55 km of fiber, about $2.14\times$ the capability of an Nvidia GTX 4090 GPU. The proposed method greatly enhances the efficiency of vibration pattern recognition, promoting the use of DVS as a smart IoT system. The data and code are available at https://github.com/HUST-IOF/Efficient-DVS.</description>
