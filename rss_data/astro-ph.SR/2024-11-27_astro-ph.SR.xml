      <title>Stereoscopic observations reveal coherent morphology and evolution of solar coronal loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal loops generally trace magnetic lines of force in the upper solar atmosphere. Understanding the loop morphology and its temporal evolution has implications for coronal heating models that rely on plasma heating due to reconnection at current sheets. Simultaneous observations of coronal loops from multiple vantage points are best suited for this purpose. Here, we report a stereoscopic analysis of coronal loops in an active region based on observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter Spacecraft and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our stereoscopic analysis reveals that coronal loops have nearly circular cross-sectional widths and that they exhibit temporally coherent intensity variations along their lengths on timescales of around 30\,minutes. Results suggest that coronal loops can be best represented as three-dimensional monolithic or coherent plasma bundles that outline magnetic field lines. Therefore, at least on the scales resolved by Solar Orbiter, it is unlikely that coronal loops are manifestations of emission from the randomly aligned wrinkles in two-dimensional plasma sheets along the line-of-sight as proposed in the `coronal veil' hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Behavior and Spatiotemporal Variations of Green Line Emission in the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding coronal structure and dynamics can be facilitated by analyzing green-line emission, which enables the investigation of diverse coronal structures such as coronal loops, streamers, coronal holes, and various eruptions in the solar atmosphere. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal behaviors of green-line emissions in both low and high latitudes across nine solar cycles, ranging from cycle 17 to the current cycle 25, using the Modified Homogeneous Data Set (MHDS). We employed methodologies such as cross-correlation, power spectral density (PSD), and wavelet transform techniques for this analysis. We found distinct behaviors in green line energy across various latitudinal distributions in the solar atmosphere. The trends observed at higher latitudes differ from those at lower latitudes. The emission behaviors show a close association with other solar phenomena like solar flares, sunspots, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) throughout the solar cycles. The observed variations exhibit harmonic periods. The emission activity is significantly higher in the low latitudes, accounting for over 70 percent of the emissions, while the higher latitudes contribute less than 30 percent. The emissions exhibit asymmetric behavior between the northern and southern hemispheres, leading to a 44-year cycle of solar hemispheric dominance shifts. Various factors, such as Alfv\'en waves, solar magnetic fields, sunspots, differential rotation, and reconnection events, influence the observed differences in behavior between lower and higher latitudes, suggesting the existence of potential underlying phenomena contributing to deviations in properties, intensity, temporal dynamics, and spatiotemporal lifetime.</description>

      <title>RAMBO I: Project introduction and first results with uGMRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hot stars can emit both coherent and incoherent non-thermal radio emission. Understanding the nature of these emissions and their connection to stellar rotation and magnetic field characteristics remains incomplete. The RAdio Magnetospheres of B and O stars (RAMBO) project aims to address this gap by systematically detecting and characterizing gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser radio emission in rapidly rotating magnetic hot stars. Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first detection of radio emission from HD55522 at 650 MHz, confirming it as a new radio-bright magnetic hot star. This supports the predictions of the Centrifugal Breakout model, furthering its application in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in centrifugal magnetospheres of hot stars. Additionally, we report non-detections for four other targets, improving sensitivity limits by a factor of a few compared to previous observations. These findings demonstrate the potential of RAMBO to uncover the complexities of radio emission in massive stars and highlight the need for broader, multi-wavelength observations to probe magnetospheric physics comprehensively. The sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array will enable significant advancements.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength high-resolution polarimetric imaging of second-generation disc around post-AGB binary IRAS 08544-4431 with SPHERE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the formation and evolution of second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) and post-Red Giant Branch (post-RGB) binaries, provides valuable insights into the complex binary interaction process that concludes the red-giant phase of evolution in these systems. Additionally, it offers a novel opportunity to investigate the formation of second-generation planets within dusty discs surrounding evolved stars. We present a pilot multi-wavelength polarimetric imaging study of the post-AGB binary system IRAS 08544-4431 using the European Southern Observatory-Very Large Telescope/SPHERE instrument. This study is focused on optical V- and I'-band ZIMPOL data to complement near-infrared H-band IRDIS data presented previously. The study aims to investigate the dust scattering properties and surface morphology of the post-AGB circumbinary disc as a function of wavelength. We successfully resolved the extended disc structure of IRAS\,08544-4431, revealing a complex disc morphology, high polarimetric disc brightness (up to ~1.5%), and significant forward scattering at optical wavelengths. Additionally, we found that the disc shows a grey polarimetric colour in both optical and near-infrared. The findings highlight similarities between post-AGB circumbinary discs and protoplanetary discs, suggesting submicron-size porous aggregates as the dominant surface dust composition, and indicating potential warping within the disc. However, further expansion of the multi-wavelength analysis to a larger sample of post-AGB binary systems, as well as high-resolution observations of dust continuum and gas emission, is necessary to fully explore the underlying structure of post-AGB circumbinary discs and associated physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Two epoch spectra-imagery of PV Cep outflow system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study the structure and kinematics of HH flows. Herbig-Haro (HH) flows exhibit large variety of morphological and kinematical structures. Both proper motion (PM) and radial velocity investigations are essential to understand the physical nature of such structures. We investigate the kinematics and PM of spectrally separated structures in the PV Cep HH flow HH 215. We present the observational results obtained with a 6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO multi-mode focal reducer with scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the PV Cep region in H$\alpha$ and [SII] emission (2003 and 2020-2021) allowed us to study the morphology of HH 215 jet in detail and to measure the PM and the radial velocities for its inner structures. Already known emission knots in the HH 215 flow and new features were studied. Moreover, a newly-formed HH knot was revealed, presumably formed during the large maximum of PV Cep star in 1976-1977. We found the high-velocity inner channel in the HH 215 ionized outflow, oriented accordingly to the mean direction of the whole HH outflow and the axis of the symmetry of the reflection nebula. The HH-knots located along the axis of the high-velocity channel have a position angle coinciding with its axis (abut 325$^{\circ}$), however other ones have completely different value (about 25$^{\circ}$), which supports the idea that those knots are formed by oblique shocks. We derived the value of i $\approx$ 30$^{\circ}$$\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ for the inclination angle between the flow axis and the line of sight. The total length of HH 215 outflow should be about 0.2 pc, and the full length of the bipolar outflow from PV Cep (HH 315 + HH 215) can be estimated as 3.6 pc, assuming that it more or less keeps the same inclination angle.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Physics in Binary Stars and Applications in Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability criteria of rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental in binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We built the adiabatic mass-loss model and systematically surveyed the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. Many studies indicate that new mass transfer stability thresholds play an essential role in the formation and properties of double compact object populations and the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources. For example, our studies show that the mass transfer in the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch stars and the massive stars can be more stable than previously believed. Consequently, detailed binary population synthesis studies, using updated unstable mass transfer criteria, predicate the non-conservative stable mass transfer may dominate the formation channel of double stellar-mass black holes and can explain the population of the large mass ratio double stellar-mass black holes. Using our updated mass transfer thresholds, binary population thesis studies by Li et al. show that Ge et al.'s results support the observational double white dwarfs merger rate distribution per Galaxy and the space density of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Dimming events of evolved stars due to clouds of molecular gas. Scenarios based on 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dramatic dimming episode of the red supergiant Betelgeuse in 2019/2020, caused by a partial darkening of the stellar disk, has highlighted gaps in the understanding of the evolution of massive stars.
  We analyzed numerical models to investigate the processes behind the formation of dark surface patches and the associated reduction in the disk-integrated stellar light.
  With the CO5BOLD code, we performed global 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of evolved stars, including convection in the stellar interior, self-excited pulsations, and the resulting atmospheric dynamics with strong radiative shocks.
  We attribute dimming phenomena to obscuring clouds of cool gas in the lower atmosphere, forming according to three different scenarios. One process transports material outward in a strong shock, similar to what occurs in 1D simulations of radially pulsating AGB stars. Another mechanism is triggered by a large convective upflow structure, in combination with exceptionally strong radial pulsations. This induces Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing plumes of material to be sent outward into the atmosphere. The third and rarest scenario involves large-amplitude convective fluctuations, leading to enhanced flows in deep downdrafts, which rebound and send material outward. In all cases, the dense gas above the stellar surface cools and darkens rapidly in visible light. AGB stars show localized dark patches regularly during intermediate phases of their large-amplitude pulsations, while more massive stars will only intermittently form such patches during luminosity minima.
  The episodic levitation of dense gas clumps above the stellar surface, followed by the formation of complex molecules in the cooling gas and possibly dust grains at a later stage, can account for the dark patches and strong dimming events of supergiant stars such as Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>Derivation and Application of a Scaling Between Hinode/SP and SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Fields to Improve Magnetic Field Extrapolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-disk measurements of the solar magnetic field by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are often used for magnetic field extrapolations, but its limited spatial and spectral resolution can lead to significant errors. We compare HMI data with observations of NOAA 12104 by the Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) to derive a scaling curve for the magnetic field strength, $B$. The SP data in the \ion{Fe}{i} lines at 630\,nm were inverted with the SIR code. We find that the Milne-Eddington inversion of HMI underestimates $B$ and the line-of-sight flux, $\Phi$, in all granulation surroundings by an average factor of 4.5 in plage and 9.2 in the quiet Sun in comparison to the SP. The deviation is inversely proportional to the magnetic fill factor, $f$, in the SP results. We derived a correction curve to match the HMI $B$ with the effective flux $B\,f$ in the SP data that scaled HMI $B$ up by 1.3 on average. A comparison of non-force-free field extrapolations over a larger field of view without and with the correction revealed minor changes in connectivity and a proportional scaling of electric currents and Lorentz force ($\propto B \sim 1.3$) and free energy ($\propto B^2\sim 2$). Magnetic field extrapolations of HMI vector data with large areas of plage and quiet Sun will underestimate the photospheric magnetic field strength by a factor of 5--10 and the coronal magnetic flux by at least 2. An HMI inversion including a fill factor would mitigate the problem.</description>

      <title>Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.</description>

      <title>A possible misaligned orbit for the young planet AU Mic c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AU Microscopii planetary system is only 24 Myr old, and its geometry may provide clues about the early dynamical history of planetary systems. Here, we present the first measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the warm sub-Neptune AU\,Mic\,c, using two transits observed simultaneously with VLT/ESPRESSO, CHEOPS, and NGTS. After correcting for flares and for the magnetic activity of the host star, and accounting for transit-timing variations, we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle of planet c to be in the range $\lambda_c=67.8_{-49.0}^{+31.7}$ degrees (1-$\sigma$). We examine the possibility that planet c is misaligned with respect to the orbit of the inner planet b ($\lambda_b=-2.96_{-10.30}^{+10.44}$ degrees), and the equatorial plane of the host star, and discuss scenarios that could explain both this and the planet's high density, including secular interactions with other bodies in the system or a giant impact. We note that a significantly misaligned orbit for planet c is in some degree of tension with the dynamical stability of the system, and with the fact that we see both planets in transit, though these arguments alone do not preclude such an orbit. Further observations would be highly desirable to constrain the spin-orbit angle of planet c more precisely.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the conundrum of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. A new approach that incorporates stellar properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exoplanets has led to the identification of intriguing patterns in their distributions, one of which is the so-called sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. The occurrence rate of Neptunian exoplanets with an orbital period $P\lesssim 4$ days sharply decreases in this region in period-radius and period-mass space. We present a novel approach to delineating the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert by considering the incident stellar flux $F$ on the planetary surface as a key parameter instead of the traditional orbital period of the planets. Through this change of perspective, we demonstrate that the incident flux still exhibits a paucity of highly irradiated Neptunes, but also captures the proximity to the host star and the intensity of stellar radiation. Leveraging a dataset of confirmed exoplanets, we performed a systematic analysis to map the boundaries of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ diagrams, with $R_p$ and $M_p$ corresponding to the planetary radius and mass, respectively. By using statistical techniques and fitting procedures, we derived analytical expressions for these boundaries that offer valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing the dearth of Neptunian planets in close proximity to their host stars. We find that the upper and lower bounds of the desert are well described by a power-law model in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ planes. We also obtain the planetary mass-radius relations for each boundary by combining the retrieved analytic expressions in the two planes. This work contributes to advancing our knowledge of exoplanet demographics and to refining theoretical models of planetary formation and evolution within the context of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert.</description>

      <title>Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kilonova spectra provide us with the direct information of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. Ra II, Ac III, and Th III are our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound-bound transitions of these candidates by constructing the line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th III is the most promising species showing strong transitions at the NIR wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th III produces broad absorption features at ~18000 A in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is $\lesssim 6\times10^{-4}$. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, the observations from the space (such as JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features is overlapped with that affected by the strong telluric absorption.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear mass models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis and heavy element abundances in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of experimental data on extremely neutron-rich nuclei, theoretical values derived from nuclear physics models are essential for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Metal-poor stars enriched by the $r$-process offer valuable cases for studying the impact of nuclear physics models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis. This study analyzes four widely used nuclear physics models in detail: Finite-Range Droplet Model, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov, Duflo-Zuker, and Weizs$\ddot{\rm a}$cker-Skyrme (WS4). Theoretical values predicted by the WS4 model are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, with deviations significantly smaller than those predicted by other models. The heavy element abundances observed in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars can be accurately reproduced by $r$-process nucleosynthesis simulations using the WS4 model, particularly for the rare earth elements. This suggests that nuclear data provided by nuclear physics model like WS4 are both essential and crucial for $r$-process nucleosynthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Secret of Longevity: Protoplanetary Disks as a Source of Gas in Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are generally thought to dissipate within several Myr, recent observations have revealed gas in debris disks. The origin of this gas remains uncertain, with one possibility being the unexpectedly long survival of PPDs (the primordial-origin scenario). To explore the plausibility of this scenario, we conduct 1D disk evolution simulations, varying parameters like stellar mass, disk mass, turbulent stress, and magnetohydrodynamic winds, while incorporating stellar evolution to account for time-varying photoevaporation rates. Our focus is on disks where small grains are depleted, as these are potentially long-lived due to reduced far-ultraviolet photoevaporation. Our results show that gas in these disks can survive beyond 10 Myr regardless of the stellar mass, provided they are initially massive ($M_{\mathrm{disk}}\approx 0.1M_*$) with relatively weak turbulent stress ($\alpha \ll 10^{-2}$). The longest lifetimes are consistently found for $M_* = 2 M_{\odot}$ across a wide parameter space, with gas typically persisting at $\sim 10$--$10^3 \mathrm{au}$. Roughly estimated CO masses for these disks fall within the observed range for the most massive gas-rich debris disks around early A stars. These alignments support the plausibility of the primordial-origin scenario. Additionally, our model predicts that accretion persists for as long as the disk survives, which could explain the accretion signatures detected in old disks hosted by low-mass stars, including Peter Pan disks. Our finding also suggests that ongoing accretion may exist in gas-rich debris disks. Thus, searching for accretion signatures could be a key factor to identifying the origin of gas in debris disks.</description>

      <title>The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17121v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Unified description of structure and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Skyrme model Sk$\chi$450 constrained by the chiral effective field theory and the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei, we explore the macroscopic static energy spectrum of dense matter. Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the two hard X-ray sources IGR J17503-2636 and IGR J17507-2647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the results of X-ray observations (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL and Swift) of two hard X-ray sources, IGR J17503-2636 and IGR J17507-2647, whose nature is not fully elucidated in the literature. Three XMM-Newton observations covered the field of IGR J17503-2636, in 2020 and twice in 2023. The analysis of the two XMM-Newton observations performed in September 2023, six days apart, did not detect IGR J17503-2636, allowing us to pose the most stringent 3sigma upper limit on the source flux to date (~9.5x10^-14 erg/cm2/s, 2-10 keV, flux corrected for absorption). This value implies that the amplitude of the X-ray flux variability exceeds a factor of ~2100, compared with the discovery outburst in 2018. A candidate X-ray periodicity at 0.335397(3) seconds has been barely detected (significance of about 3.8sigma) from IGR J17503-2636 with XMM-Newton (pulsed fraction of (10+/-1) per cent). The new data, put into the context of previous literature, allow us to propose a new classification of IGR J17503-2636 as a symbiotic X-ray binary, rather than a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient. IGR J17507-2647 was formerly reported below 10 keV only during Chandra observations performed in 2009. We report here on two XMM-Newton observations that serendipitously covered the source field in 2020 and in 2023, finding a stable X-ray emission, both in X-ray flux and spectral shape. The long-term, persistent X-ray emission has also been probed by several Swift/XRT short observations and by INTEGRAL data spanning several years. We have detected an iron line in the emission (with centroid energy in the range of 6.3-6.6 keV), never reported before in the IGR J17507-2647 spectrum. The source properties favor the identification with a cataclysmic variable.</description>

      <title>A link between rocky exoplanet composition and stellar age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interior compositions are key for our understanding of Earth-like exoplanets. The composition of the core can influence the presence of a magnetic dynamo and the strength of gravity on the planetary surface, both of which heavily impact thermal and possible biological processes and thus the habitability for life and its evolution on the planet. However, detailed measurements of the planetary interiors are extremely challenging for small exoplanets, and existing data suggest a wide diversity in planet compositions. Hitherto, only certain photospheric chemical abundances of the host stars have been considered as tracers to explain the diversity of exoplanet compositions. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting rocky exoplanets, with ages between 2 and 14 Gyr, revealing a correlation between rocky exoplanet compositions and the ages of the planetary systems. Denser rocky planets are found around younger stars. This suggests that the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets can be linked to the ages of their host stars. We interpret this to be a result of chemical evolution of stars in the Milky Way, which modifies the material out of which stars and planets form. The results imply that rocky planets which form today, at similar galactocentric radii, may have different formation conditions, and thus different properties than planets which formed several billion years ago, such as the Earth.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulation of nucleon distribution and shell closure in the proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si is studied using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with high-fidelity chiral forces. Our results indicate that $^{22}$Si is more tightly bound than $^{20}$Mg, thereby excluding the possibility of two-proton emission. The $Z = 14$ shell closure in $^{22}$Si is supported by the evolution of the $2^+$ state in the neighboring nuclei. We then focus on the charge radius and spatial distribution information of $^{22}$Si, considering the novel phenomena that may emerge due to the small two-proton separation energy and the shell closure. We present the distribution of the $14$ protons and $8$ neutrons obtained from our lattice simulation, revealing insights into the spatial arrangement of the nucleons. Moreover, the spatial localization of the outermost proton and neutron suggests that $^{22}$Si is a doubly magic nucleus. Furthermore, we develop the pinhole method based on the harmonic oscillator basis, which gives insight into the nuclear structure in terms of the shell model picture from lattice simulations. Our calculated occupation numbers support that $Z = 14$ and $N = 8$ are the shell closures and show that the $\pi 1s_{1/2}$ orbital component is minor in $^{22}$Si.</description>

      <title>Chemically Self-Consistent Modeling of the Globular Cluster NGC 2808 and its Effects on the Inferred Helium Abundance of Multiple Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helium abundances in the multiple populations that are now known to comprise all closely studied Milky Way globular clusters are often inferred by fitting isochrones generated from stellar evolutionary models to globular cluster photometry. It is therefore important to build stellar models that are chemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and opacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar models of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 2808 using MARCS model atmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS low-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC 2808 photometry using Fidanka , a new software tool that was developed to optimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis. Fidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of distinct populations that exist within a dataset and then fit isochrones to each population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm. Using Fidanka and F275W-F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in NGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by $15\pm3\%$. This is in agreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous work by Dotter et al. (2015) focused on NGC 6752, demonstrates that chemically self-consistent models of globular clusters do not significantly alter inferred helium abundances, and are therefore unlikely to be worth the significant additional time investment.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (&gt;100 parsecs) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Searching for star-planet interactions in GJ 486 at radio wavelengths with the uGMRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for radio emission from star-planet interactions in the M-dwarf system GJ~486, which hosts an Earth-like planet. We observed the GJ~486 system with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) from 550 to 750 MHz in nine different epochs, between October 2021 and February 2022, covering almost all orbital phases of GJ~486 b from different orbital cycles. We obtained radio images and dynamic spectra of the total and circularly polarized intensity for each individual epoch We do not detect any quiescent radio emission in any epoch above 3$\sigma$. Similarly, we do not detect any bursty emission in our dynamic spectra.
  While we cannot completely rule out that the absence of a radio detection is due to time variability of the radio emission, or to the maximum electron-cyclotron maser emission being below our observing range, this seems unlikely. We discuss two possible scenarios: an intrinsic dim radio signal, or alternatively, that the anisotropic beamed emission pointed away from the observer. If the non-detection of radio emission from star-planet interaction in GJ~486 is due to an intrinsically dim signal, this implies that, independently of whether the planet is magnetized or not, the mass-loss rate is small (\dot{M}_\star $\lesssim$ 0.3 \dot{M}_\sun) and that, concomitantly, the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into radio emission must be low ($\beta \lesssim 10^{-3}$). Free-free absorption effects are negligible, given the high value of the coronal temperature. Finally, if the anisotropic beaming pointed away from us, this would imply that GJ~486 has very low values of its magnetic obliquity and inclination.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>

Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale energy transfer from fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer</title>

Abstract: In space plasmas, large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves can drive compressive perturbations, accelerate ion beams, and lead to plasma heating and the excitation of ion acoustic waves at kinetic scales. This energy channelling from fluid to kinetic scales represents a complementary path to the classical turbulent cascade. Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\'en waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\'en velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\'en-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves are present.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) as a potentially significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02860</link>

Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>
