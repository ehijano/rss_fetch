      <title>Data Fusion for Partial Identification of Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data fusion techniques integrate information from heterogeneous data sources to improve learning, generalization, and decision making across data sciences. In causal inference, these methods leverage rich observational data to improve causal effect estimation, while maintaining the trustworthiness of randomized controlled trials. Existing approaches often relax the strong no unobserved confounding assumption by instead assuming exchangeability of counterfactual outcomes across data sources. However, when both assumptions simultaneously fail - a common scenario in practice - current methods cannot identify or estimate causal effects. We address this limitation by proposing a novel partial identification framework that enables researchers to answer key questions such as: Is the causal effect positive or negative? and How severe must assumption violations be to overturn this conclusion? Our approach introduces interpretable sensitivity parameters that quantify assumption violations and derives corresponding causal effect bounds. We develop doubly robust estimators for these bounds and operationalize breakdown frontier analysis to understand how causal conclusions change as assumption violations increase. We apply our framework to the Project STAR study, which investigates the effect of classroom size on students' third-grade standardized test performance. Our analysis reveals that the Project STAR results are robust to simultaneous violations of key assumptions, both on average and across various subgroups of interest. This strengthens confidence in the study's conclusions despite potential unmeasured biases in the data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Realized Variance Estimation in Time-Changed Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the benefits of sampling intraday returns in intrinsic time for the realized variance (RV) estimator. We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</description>

      <title>Nested Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several causal parameters in short panel data models are functionals of a nested nonparametric instrumental variable regression (nested NPIV). Recent examples include mediated, time varying, and long term treatment effects identified using proxy variables. In econometrics, examples arise in triangular simultaneous equations and hedonic price systems. However, it appears that explicit mean square convergence rates for nested NPIV are unknown, preventing inference on some of these parameters with generic machine learning. A major challenge is compounding ill posedness due to the nested inverse problems. To limit how ill posedness compounds, we introduce two techniques: relative well posedness, and multiple robustness to ill posedness. With these techniques, we provide explicit mean square rates for nested NPIV and efficient inference for recently identified causal parameters. Our nonasymptotic analysis accommodates neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. It extends to causal functions, e.g. heterogeneous long term treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Selection for Value Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting the best $m$ units from a set of $n$ as $m / n \to \alpha \in (0, 1)$, where noisy, heteroskedastic measurements of the units' true values are available and the decision-maker wishes to maximize the aggregate true value of the units selected. Given a parametric prior distribution, the empirical Bayes decision rule incurs $O_p(n^{-1})$ regret relative to the Bayesian oracle that knows the true prior. More generally, if the error in the estimated prior is of order $O_p(r_n)$, regret is $O_p(r_n^2)$. In this sense \emph{selection} of the best units is fundamentally easier than \emph{estimation} of their values. We show this regret bound is sharp in the parametric case, by giving an example in which it is attained. Using priors calibrated from a dataset of over four thousand internet experiments, we confirm that empirical Bayes methods perform well in detecting the best treatments with only a modest number of experiments.</description>
