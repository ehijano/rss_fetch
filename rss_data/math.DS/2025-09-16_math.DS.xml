      <title>Uniform Diophantine approximation on the plane for $\beta$-dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional uniform Diophantine approximation in $\beta$-dynamical systems. Let $\beta_i &gt; 1(i=1,2)$ be real numbers, and let $T_{\beta_i}$ denote the $\beta_i$-transformation defined on $[0, 1]$. For each $(x, y) \in[0,1]^2$, we define the asymptotic approximation exponent $$ v_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\sup \left\{0 \leq v&lt;\infty: \begin{array}{l} T_{\beta_1}^n x&lt;\beta_1^{-n v} \\ T_{\beta_2}^n y&lt;\beta_2^{-n v} \end{array} \text { for infinitely many } n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \text {, } $$ and the uniform approximation exponent $$ \hat{v}_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\sup \left\{0 \leq \hat{v}&lt;\infty: \forall~ N \gg 1, \exists 1 \leq n \leq N \text { such that } \begin{array}{l} T_{\beta_1}^n x &lt; \beta_1^{-N \hat{v}} \\ T_{\beta_2}^n y &lt; \beta_2^{-N \hat{v}} \end{array}\right\} . $$ We calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection $$\left\{(x, y) \in[0,1]^2: \hat{v}_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\hat{v} \text { and } v_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=v\right\}$$ for any $\hat{v}$ and $v$ satisfying $\log _{\beta_2}{\beta_1}&gt;\frac{\hat{v}}{v}(1+v)$. As a corollary, we establish a definite formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the level set of the uniform approximation exponent.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of Remotely Almost Periodic solutions of differential equations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish existence and uniqueness of remotely almost periodic (RAP) solutions for nonlinear ordinary differential systems $x' = A(t)x + f(t,x) + g_{\nu}(t,x).$ Assuming that the linear equation $x' = A(t)x$ admits an exponential dichotomy and that the associated Green kernel is exponentially bi-remotely almost periodic, we derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing a unique RAP solution of the perturbed system for $\nu$ in a suitable range. As an application, we obtain RAP solutions for a nonautonomous Brusselator model.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems III: Symbolic and Expansive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonautonomous dynamical system $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})=\{(X_{k},T_{k})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}:X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$ along a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$. In this paper, we study the nonautonomous symbolic systems $(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{m}),\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ and nonautonomous expansive dynamical systems. We prove homogeneous properties and provide the formulae for topological pressures $\underline{P},\overline{P},P^{\mathrm{B}},P^{\mathrm{P}}$ on symbolic systems for potentials $\boldsymbol{f}=\{f_{k} \in C(\Sigma_{k}^{\infty}(\boldsymbol{m}),\mathbb{R})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ with strongly bounded variation. We also give the formulae for the measure-theoretic pressures of nonautonomous Bernoulli measures and obtain equilibrium states in nonautonomous symbolic systems for certain classes of potentials. Finally, we prove the existence of generators for pressure in strongly uniformly expansive (sue) systems. We show that all nonautonomous sue systems have symbolic extensions, and that a class of nonautonomous sue systems on 0-topological-dimensional spaces $X_{k}$ may be embedded in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modeling and simulation of an electric flash clay calcination plant for green cement production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dynamic model of an electric flash clay calcination plant. Calcined kaolinite-rich clay has been identified as one of the most effective candidates for supplementary cementitious material (SCM), because of its large availability. Calcination of clay is achieved via the dehydroxylation reaction, which does not release CO2 (unlike limestone), but has a considerable energy requirement. The required high temperature can be met by electric resistive heating of the working gas in the plant, that can be powered by renewable energy. Therefore, CO2-free calcination of clay can be achieved. Up to 50\% of the limestone-based clinker can be substituted by calcined clay (CC), making the cement more sustainable. We consider a plant that consists of gas-material cyclones that pre-heat the clay, a calciner, and a gas-recirculation system with electric heating of the gas. The model is formulated as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The model consists of thermophysical properties, reaction kinetics and stoichiometry, transport, mass and energy balances, and algebraic constraints. The model can be used to perform dynamic simulations with changing inputs, process design, and optimization. Moreover, it can be used to develop model-based control, which is relevant for flexible operation of a clay calcination plant for green cement production.</description>

      <title>On complex algebraic caustics in planar and projective billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A caustic of a billiard is a curve whose tangent lines are reflected to its own tangent lines. A billiard is called Birkhoff caustic-integrable, if there exists a topological annulus adjacent to its boundary from inside that is foliated by closed caustics. The famous Birkhoff Conjecture, studied by many mathematicians, states that the only Birkhoff caustic-integrable billiards are ellipses. The conjecture is open even for billiards whose boundaries are ovals of algebraic curves. In this case the billiard is known to have a dense family of so-called rational caustics that are also ovals of algebraic curves. We introduce the notion of a complex caustic: a complex algebraic curve whose complex tangent lines are sent by complexified reflection to its own complex tangent lines. We show that the usual billiard on a real planar curve $\gamma$ has a complex caustic, if and only if $\gamma$ is a conic. We prove analogous result for billiards on all the surfaces of constant curvature. These results are corollaries of the solution of S.Bolotin's polynomial integrability conjecture: a joint result by M.Bialy, A.Mironov and the author. We extend them to the projective billiards introduced by S.Tabachnikov, which are a common generalization of billiards on surfaces of constant curvature. We also deal with a well-known class of projective billiards on conics that are defined to have caustics forming a dual conical pencil. We show that up to restriction to a finite union of arcs, each of them is equivalent to a billiard on appropriate surface of constant curvature.</description>

      <title>Ergodic approach to the study of boundedness of solutions of one type of the first-order semilinear difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sufficient conditions for boundedness of one type of difference equations of the form $x(n+1)=ax(n)+f(x(n)) + y(n), \ n\geq 1$ in critical case $|a|=1$.
  For this equation the following assumptions are introduced:
  1) The function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ and the input sequence $\{y(n)\}_{n\geq1}$ are assumed to be bounded.
  2) $\text{Re}\left(\overline{f(\rho \, e^{2\pi i \theta})} \; \cdot ae^{2\pi i \theta}\right)$ converges uniformly on $[0,1) \ni \theta$ to some real-valued function $\Phi(\theta)$ as $\rho \to +\infty$ .
  Combining the celebrated results of the probability and ergodic theory together with the geometric consideration of the problem, we show that under fairly general conditions this type of semilinear difference equations has all the solutions bounded.
  Subsequently we formulate the quantitative version of our theorem and give the example of its application.
  In addition, in the last section we discuss the conditions of our main result and provide the constructions, which highlight the importance of these conditions.</description>

      <title>Some dynamical properties of weighted shifts on sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by three recent open questions in the study of linear dynamics, we study weighted shifts on sequence spaces. First, we provide an~example of a~weighted shift on a~locally convex space whose topology is generated by a~sequence of complete seminorms which is generalized hyperbolic, but does not have the shadowing property. Next, we characterise uniform topological expansivity on Fr\'echet spaces satisfying some very natural conditions. Finally, we study the periodic shadowing property on normed spaces leading to a~condition formulated purely in terms of weights which we show is necessary for the periodic shadowing property on $\ell_p$ and equivalent on $c_0$.</description>

      <title>Choice Paralysis in Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Amenability, Optimal Transport and Abstract Ergodic Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tools from the theory of optimal transport, we establish several results concerning isometric actions of amenable topological groups with potentially unbounded orbits. Specifically, suppose $d$ is a compatible left-invariant metric on an amenable topological group $G$ with no non-trivial homomorphisms to $\mathbb R$. Then, for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is a finitely supported probability measure $\beta$ on $G$ such that $$ \max_{g,h\in E}\, {\sf W}(\beta g, \beta h)&lt;\epsilon, $$ where ${\sf W}$ denotes the Wasserstein distance between probability measures on the metric space $(G,d)$. When $d$ is the word metric on a finitely generated group $G$, this strengthens a well known theorem of Reiter and, when $d$ is bounded, recovers a result of Schneider and Thom. Furthermore, when $G$ is locally compact, $\beta$ may be replaced by an appropriate probability density $f\in L^1(G)$.
  Also, when $G\curvearrowright X$ is a continuous isometric action on a metric space, the space of Lipschitz functions on the quotient $X/\!\!/G$ is isometrically isomorphic to a $1$-complemented subspace of the Lipschitz functions on $X$. And, when additionally $G$ is skew-amenable, there is a $G$-invariant contraction $$ \mathfrak {Lip}\, X \overset S\longrightarrow\mathfrak{Lip}(X/\!\!/G) $$ so that $(S\phi\big)\big(\overline{Gx}\big)=\phi(x)$ whenever $\phi$ is constant on every orbit of $G\curvearrowright X$. This latter extends results of Cuth and Doucha from the setting of locally compact or balanced groups.</description>

      <title>On the common index jump theorem and further developments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [LZ02], Long and Zhu established originally the common index jump theorem (CIJT) for symplectic paths in 2002, which was later generalized to its enhanced version (ECIJT) by Duan, Long and Wang in [DLW16] in 2016. Started from [GGM18] of 2018 and [GG20] of 2020, and finally in [CGG24] of 2024, a similar index theorem was obtained, i.e., Theorem 3.3 of [CGG24], which was called the index recurrence theorem there. In this short note, we give detailed proofs to show that the first 4 assertions dealing with index iterations in the total of 5 assertions in Theorem 3.3 of [CGG24] actually coincide completely with results in (ECIJT) of [DLW16]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We show that there is a large $x_0&gt;0$ such that this inequality fails infinitely often for integers $x\ge x_0$. To this aim we analyze the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that, we see, becomes crucial.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Groups of Basins of Attraction in Equivariant Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches: (i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states. Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results, illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical and biological models where basin structure determines stability and predictability.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T &gt; 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J &gt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J &lt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
  These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M\"uller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</description>

      <title>Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Quantization Errors, Human--AI Interaction, and Approximate Fixed Points in $L^1(\mu)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous measure-theoretic framework for the analysis of fixed points of nonexpansive maps in the space $L^1(\mu)$, with explicit consideration of quantization errors arising in fixed-point arithmetic. Our central result shows that every bounded, closed, convex subset of $L^1(\mu)$ that is compact in the topology of local convergence in measure (a property we refer to as measure-compactness) enjoys the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings. The proof relies on techniques from uniform integrability, convexity in measure, and normal structure theory, including an application of Kirk's theorem. We further analyze the effect of quantization by modeling fixed-point arithmetic as a perturbation of a nonexpansive map, establishing the existence of approximate fixed points under measure-compactness conditions. We also present counterexamples that illustrate the optimality of our assumptions.
  Beyond the theoretical development, we apply this framework to a human-in-the-loop co-editing system. By formulating the interaction between an AI-generated proposal, a human editor, and a quantizer as a composition of nonexpansive maps on a measure-compact set, we demonstrate the existence of a "stable consensus artefact". We prove that such a consensus state remains an approximate fixed point even under bounded quantization errors, and we provide a concrete example of a human-AI editing loop that fits this framework. Our results underscore the value of measure-theoretic compactness in the design and verification of reliable collaborative systems involving humans and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>A Chebyshev--Ritz Spectral Framework for Nonlinear Vibration of CNT-Reinforced Composite Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free vibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams. Boundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations incorporate von~K\'{a}rm\'{a}n geometric nonlinearity, while the effective material properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT distributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization via the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting exponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \geq 12$, the fundamental frequency error remains below $0.1\%$ relative to published benchmarks.
  Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the spectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite element discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that the fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive to the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\eta_E$. Selected FG patterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs.
  Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative differences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its reliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse shear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future work. All numerical data and scripts are provided as supplementary material to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Fractional-Order Nesterov Dynamics for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a class of second-order dynamical systems for continuous-time optimization that incorporate fractional-order gradient terms. The system is given by \begin{equation} \ddot{x}(t) + \frac{\alpha}{t}\dot{x}(t) + \nabla^{\theta} f(x(t)) = 0, \end{equation} where $\theta \in (1,2)$, and the fractional operators are interpreted in the sense of Caputo, Riemann--Liouville, and Gr\"unwald--Letnikov derivatives. This formulation interpolates between memory effects of fractional dynamics and higher-order damping mechanisms, thereby extending the classical Nesterov accelerated flow into the fractional domain. A particular focus of our analysis is the regime $\alpha \leq 3$, and especially the critical case $\alpha = 3$, where the ordinary Nesterov flow fails to guarantee convergence. We show that in the fractional setting, convergence can still be established, with fractional gradient terms providing a stabilizing effect that compensates for the borderline damping. This highlights the ability of fractional dynamics to overcome fundamental limitations of classical second-order flows. We develop a convergence analysis framework for such systems by introducing fractional Opial-type lemmas and Lyapunov memory functionals. In the convex case, we establish weak convergence of trajectories toward the minimizer, as well as asymptotic decay of functional values. For strongly convex functions, we obtain explicit convergence rates that improve upon those of standard second-order flows</description>

      <title>Towards sharp regularity: Full-dimensional tori in $ C^\infty $ vector fields over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $ C^1 $ linearization of a perturbed vector field $ \omega+P $ over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $, and determine the sharp regularity requirement of the perturbation $ P $ conjugating the unperturbed one $ \omega $ onto $ \omega-\tilde{\omega}+P $ via a small modifying term $ \tilde{\omega} $. We discuss the Diophantine type introduced by Bourgain, investigate the universal nonresonance, and provide the weakest known regularity of perturbations for which KAM applies. Our results allow for lower regularity than analyticity such as Gevrey regularity or even $ C^\infty $ regularity. We propose a new KAM scheme with a balancing sequence to overcome the non-polynomial nonresonance, differing from the usual Newtonian approach. Thereby, in addition to deriving the sharp Gevrey exponent along Diophantine nonresonance, we answer the fundamental question of what the minimum regularity required for KAM is in the infinite-dimensional setting: $ C^\infty $ regularity. Our linearization technique also applies to the quasi-periodic case over $ \mathbb{T}^n $.</description>

Abstract: We give explicit upper bounds for the entropy in the cusp for one-parameter diagonal flows on $SL_d(\mathbb{R})/SL_{d}(\mathbb{Z})$. These results include bounds for the entropy of the cusp as a whole, as well as for the cusp regions corresponding to either the maximal parabolic subgroups of $SL_{d}$, or the minimal (Borel) parabolic subgroup. To do so, we use a method which involves choosing an auxiliary linear functional on the Lie algebra of the Cartan group, specifically tailored to each of the bounds we are interested in. In a follow-up paper we prove that the upper bounds we obtain in this work are tight.</description>

Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to obtain Berry--Esseen type error bounds in the multivariate central limit theorem for non-stationary processes generated by time-dependent compositions of uniformly expanding dynamical systems. In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix "grows linearly" with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown that the Sierpi\'nski gasket-like sets can appear as the Julia sets of some geometrically finite rational maps. In this paper we prove that such type of Julia sets can also appear in the rational maps containing Siegel disks, Cremer points or which are infinitely renormalizable. Based on this, we prove the existence of gasket Julia sets with positive area. Moreover, we present a criterion which guarantees the existence of gasket Julia sets in some rational maps having exactly one fixed attracting or parabolic basin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

Abstract: For an aperiodic subshift of finite type $Y$ and for a subshift $X$ with topological entropy less than the topological entropy of $Y$, a theorem is proved in Krieger: On the subsystems of topological Markov chains, Ergodic Theory \&amp; dynamical systems 1982 $\bold{2}$, 195-202, that says that the necessary condition on the periodic points of $X$ and $Y$ for the existence of an embedding of $X$ into $Y$ is also sufficient for the existence of an embedding of $X$ into $Y$. In this note we point out that this theorem extends to certain classes of sofic shifts as target shifts.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. The two main results in this paper are:
  Result 1: If Standard conjecture D holds on $X\times X$, then all polarised endomorphisms on $X$ are semisimple.
  Result 2: Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$. What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles), for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures should follow from Standard conjecture D. All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countably infinite discrete group. A $\Gamma$-flow $X$ (i.e., a nonempty compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $\Gamma$) is called $S$-minimal for a subset $S \subseteq \Gamma$ if the partial orbit $S \cdot x$ is dense for every point $x \in X$. We show that for any countable family $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite subsets of $\Gamma$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $X$ that is $S_n$-minimal for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; additionally, $X$ can be taken to be a subflow of $2^\Gamma$. This vastly generalizes a result of Frisch, Seward, and Zucker, in which each $S_n$ is required to be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. As a corollary, we show that for a given Polish $\Gamma$-flow $X$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $Y$ disjoint from $X$ in the sense of Furstenberg if and only if $X$ has no wandering points. This completes a line of inquiry started by Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. As another application, we strengthen some of the results of Gao, Jackson, Krohne, and Seward on the structure of Borel complete sections. For example, we show that if $B$ is a Borel complete section in the free part of $2^\Gamma$, then every union of sufficiently many shifts of $B$ contains an orbit (previously, this was only known for open sets $B$). Although our main results are purely dynamical, their proofs rely on recently developed machinery from descriptive set-theoretic combinatorics, namely the asymptotic separation index introduced by Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob and its links to the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma.</description>

      <title>Approximation by invariant Dirac measures on non-positively curved manifolds</title>

Abstract: We study the topology of the space of probability measures invariant under the geodesic flow, defined on the unit-tangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature. Building on a previous work by Coud\`ene and Schapira we introduce the set of \textit{weakly regular} vectors, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_w$: a vector in the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is weakly regular if for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, its $\epsilon$-stable set and $\epsilon$-unstable set both intersect the set $\Omega_{NF}$ of non-wandering vectors whose orbit does not bound a flat strip. We show that every ergodic probability measure supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$ can be approximated by Dirac measures supported on periodic orbits in $\Omega_{NF}$. As a consequence, ergodicity is a generic property in the space of invariant measures supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$. We illustrate our findings using a famous example of rank-one manifold attributed to Heintze and Gromov, demonstrating that in this setting the inclusion $\Omega_{NF} \subset \mathcal{R}_w$ is proper and $\mathcal{R}_w$ is the maximal subset of the unit-tangent bundle satisfying the density property stated above. Finally, as a consequence of our main result, we describe the topology of the closure of the set of ergodic probability measures and provide a complete decomposition of the space of finite invariant measures on the unit-tangent bundle of the Heintze-Gromov manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that maximal analytic Hardy fields are $\eta_1$ in the sense of Hausdorff. We also prove various embedding theorems about analytic Hardy fields.

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents: a pursuer, an evader, and a defender. Cooperative guidance laws are developed for the evader-defender team that guarantee interception of the pursuer by the defender before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, a geometry-based solution is proposed to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another notable feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy, yet the pursuer's interception is guaranteed for arbitrary initial engagement geometries. It is further shown that the relevant error variables for the evader-defender team (or individual) converge to zero at a prespecified finite time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative pursuit-evasion strategy is demonstrated through simulations across diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Infinite stationary measures of co-compact group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and mixing for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general quantitative conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive Wiener noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated exponentially ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Furthermore, we provide quantitative upper bounds for the Wasserstein $\varepsilon$-mixing times. Examples on possibly unbounded domains include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Differential Stochastic Variational Inequalities with Parametric Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The differential stochastic variational inequality with parametric convex optimization (DSVI-O) is an ordinary differential equation whose right-hand side involves a stochastic variational inequality and solutions of several dynamic and random parametric convex optimization problems. We consider that the distribution of the random variable is time-dependent and assume that the involved functions are continuous and the expectation is well-defined. We show that the DSVI-O has a weak solution with integrable and measurable solutions of the parametric optimization problems. Moreover, we propose a discrete scheme of DSVI-O by using a time-stepping approximation and the sample average approximation and prove the convergence of the discrete scheme. We illustrate our theoretical results of DSVI-O with applications in an embodied intelligence system for the elderly health by synthetic health care data generated by Multimodal Large Language Models.</description>
