      <title>Evolving scale-free networks and node-based random edge deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a growing network model that combines preferential and uniform attachment with two distinct mechanisms of edge deletion. In addition to the usual uniform probability edge deletion, we introduce a novel node-based rule in which uniformly chosen non-isolated nodes lose one of their incident edges. This mechanism differs fundamentally from uniform edge deletion and leads to a nonlinear evolution for the stationary degree distribution due to the nonlinear dependence on the fraction of isolated nodes. We solve the general problem in the stationary regime and obtain closed-form expressions for the degree distribution in terms of hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions. Depending on the balance between attachment and deletion rates, three asymptotic regimes for the degree distribution arise: power-law, exponential, and a critical regime characterized by a stretched exponential decay. We show that the node-based edge deletion mechanism is less likely to disrupt the scale-free (power-law) regime than the uniform edge deletion. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the precise balance between preferential attachment and node-based deletion can transform a scale-free network into a critical one with stretched exponential decay. Extensive numerical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Analytical characterization of self sustained nonlinear oscillators modelling human walking and bouncing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have developed hybrid Van der Pol Rayleigh Duffing type oscillators to model human induced forces; however, their analytical framework has largely relied on the Lindstedt Poincare perturbation method, energy balance approaches, and harmonic balance techniques. This paper aims to apply new mathematical tools to these existing models and address potential research gaps. An analytical proof for the stability of the limit cycle has been formulated by using the Krylov Bogolyubov perturbation method. The multiple scales method has been modified to highlight an iterative algorithm for determining the order of approximation required to capture nonlinear effects. The describing function method is utilised to formulate an alternate amplitude. Comparisons between first order amplitudes obtained from perturbation analysis and the describing function formulations reveal conditions under which the two approaches converge. These conditions are exploited to formulate additional constraints for the estimation of model parameters, offering a systematic alternative to purely optimisation based approaches.</description>

      <title>Emergence of opinion splits in the Sznajd model with latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modelling of social systems, opinion latency is the idea that once an agent changes its opinion, there will be a period of time where it is immune to other changes. When added to the voter model this leads to a situation where no matter how low the latency is or how many opinions are considered, all opinions end up in a coexistence where they are equally represented. In this work, we examine what happens when latency is added to the Sznajd model. What we find is that for low latency, the model behaves roughly like it does in the absence of latency, where one opinion will always eventually dominate. For high latency, the possibility for a symmetric coexistence of 2 opinions arises, but contrary to the voter model, a coexistence of more than 2 opinions is never stable. We provide evidence of this phenomenon with computer simulations of the model in Barab\'asi-Albert networks, together with a mean field treatment that is able to capture the observed behavior. We argue that this could hint at an explanation for the prevalence of two opinion splits in the real world.</description>

      <title>Arc-length characterization of finite, radial growth patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to characterize the distribution of length-scales of finite, disordered patterns with, on average, radial symmetry. This method makes it possible to quantify the distribution of characteristic length scales in cases where the conventional "linear" chord method does not work. We show that the method can clearly distinguish regular patterns, patterns that are formed by diffusion-limited aggregation, and patterns that form during the slow drying of confined, colloid-laden droplets, explained by Beechey-Newman et al.1 We also introduce a method to find the centre-point of these finite patterns, without assuming a full connectivity in the pattern. The method should be widely applicable to other, finite quasi-two-dimensional patterns.</description>

      <title>Metastability induced by non-reciprocal adaptive couplings in Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings are frequently found in systems out-of-equilibrium such as neuronal networks. We consider generalized Kuramoto models with non-reciprocal adaptive couplings. The non-reciprocity refers to the type of couplings according to Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules and to different time scales on which the couplings evolve. The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metastability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters is individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties" between clusters of synchronized oscillators, where an individual oscillator may represent an entire brain area. The time series exhibit random features but arise from deterministic dynamics.</description>
