      <title>Oscillatons in Scalar-Field Dark Matter from a Full Fourier Expansion of an Exponential Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real, time-dependent scalar fields can form oscillating, self-gravitating configurations-oscillatonsthat are viable candidates for scalar-field dark matter (SFDM). We revisit oscillatons with an exponential self-interaction and develop a full Fourier (Jacobi{Anger) treatment that resums the time dependence of both the metric and the potential, thereby unifying quadratic, quartic, and higher-order interactions within a single framework. After fixing the small-amplitude normalization V0 = m2 {\Phi}=({\lambda}2k0), we derive a closed, dimensionless boundary-value problem for the radial profiles and solve it numerically via Bessel-series truncation with controlled convergence. We compute time-resolved and time-averaged observables energy density, radial energy flux, radial/tangential pressures, and total mass and map their dependence on the coupling {\lambda} and central amplitude. The geometry exhibits only even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, while composite observables inherit a DC part plus even harmonics; the radial flux oscillates predominantly at 2!. Apparent negative instantaneous pressures arise from coherent oscillations and are assessed consistently through classical energy-condition diagnostics (WEC/NEC/SEC). Our formulation provides a reproducible and extensible baseline for stability analyses and observational constraints on SFDM oscillatons</description>

      <title>Mechanics of non-Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of stationary axisymmetric non-Killing horizons, which emerge in spacetimes that do not enjoy the symmetry known as circularity -- as is commonly the case for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. Specifically, we define and compute three notions of surface gravity: inaffinity, normal, and peeling; and find that the inaffinity and normal definitions generically differ, while the normal and peeling definitions always agree, although none of them is constant over the horizon. We then derive a version of Smarr's formula, which appears to involve an average over the horizon of the normal surface gravity. We also compute, via the tunnelling method, the spectrum of Hawking's radiation, verifying that its temperature is controlled by the (non-constant) peeling surface gravity. Finally, we recapitulate the status of the four laws of black hole mechanics in situations in which the event horizon fails to be Killing. Our results thus pave the way to a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Dark matter halo as a source of regular black-hole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact black-hole solutions free of curvature singularities, sourced by dark matter halos described by galactic density profiles. Regularity of the geometry is ensured by adopting the relation $P_{r}=-\rho$ between radial pressure and density, which is consistent with the phenomenological freedom of halo models. In particular, the sufficiently dense Einasto and Dehnen-type profiles for the dark matter halo can produce asymptotically flat solutions of singularity-free black holes embedded in the galactic environment. The resulting regular black holes surrounded by dark matter are shown to be stable under axial perturbations. We further compute the shadow radii and Lyapunov exponents associated with the photon circular orbits around these black holes.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate analytical formulas for light propagation in general static, spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics, presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.</description>

      <title>Full Classification of Static Spherical Vacuum Solutions to Bumblebee Gravity with General VEVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field $B_\mu$ has a two-component space-like, light-like, and time-like vacuum expectation value $b_\mu$ is studied. Based on the results, we present a comprehensive classification of the static spherical vacuum solutions in bumblebee gravity with general vacuum expectation values. We find that the model becomes degenerate for a specific set of parameter combinations, where the solution can be characterized by an arbitrary function, which indicates that the non-minimally coupled massless vector tensor theory is ill-defined when $\xi=\kappa/2$. We also find that contrary to the situation in general relativity, the bumblebee gravity admits the exact Schwarzschild solution with non-zero matter distributions of certain forms. The implications of this result are discussed, suggesting that the experimental constraints within the solar system would be invalid.</description>

      <title>Viscous Fluid Models of Cosmic Acceleration in FRW Spacetime Using MCMC Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study combines theoretical advancements with observational limitations to investigate the cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) in a Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) in (3+1) dimensional spacetime framework. We provide analytical solutions for both viscous and non-viscous cases, pointing out variations in the energy density evolution, the Hubble parameter dynamics, and the deceleration parameter transitions. Bulk viscosity suppresses oscillations in structure creation, a well-known drawback of Chaplygin gas models in larger dimensions, as shown by a thorough perturbation analysis. Using the bulk viscosity coefficient and Hubble expansion parameter, which are incorporated by the total pressure and the appropriate pressure and by using energy momentum conservation law determined time time-dependent density. With the help of three conditions ($\xi = 0$, $\xi\neq0$, and we neglect both bulk viscosity and presence of Chaplygin gas, i.e $A=0$ and $\xi=0$) created three different models as the Hubble parameter is a function of redshift $z$. By applying the MCMC method to these models, we have gone through observational analysis by using the Hubble and BAO datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Thermodynamic Stability of Superconducting-superfluid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of neutron stars composed of superconducting-superfluid mixtures within the Iyer-Wald formalism. We derive the first law of thermodynamics and the necessary and sufficient condition under which dynamic equilibrium implies thermodynamic equilibrium. By constructing the phase space and canonical energy, we show that the dynamic stability for perturbations, restricted in symplectic complement of trivial perturbations with the ADM 3-momentum unchanged, is equivalent to the non-negativity of the canonical energy. Furthermore, dynamic stability against restricted axisymmetric perturbations guarantees the dynamic stability against all axisymmetric perturbations. We also prove that the positivity of canonical energy on all axisymmetric perturbations within the Lagrangian displacement framework with fixed angular momentum is necessary for thermodynamic stability. In particular, the equivalence of dynamic and thermodynamic stability for spherically symmetric perturbations of static, spherically symmetric isentropic configurations is established.</description>

      <title>Wormhole spacetimes in an expanding universe: energy conditions and future singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However, once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Massive Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Particles around Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far, there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles' intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative magnitude $&gt;10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole. Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum spin correction.</description>

      <title>Wald Entropy in Extended Modified Myrzakulov Gravity Theories: \(f(R, T, Q, R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}Q^{\mu\nu}, \dots)\)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole entropy in a broad class of modified Myrzakulov gravity theories defined by generalized Lagrangians of the form \( \mathcal{L} = \alpha R + F(T, Q, R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}Q^{\mu\nu}, \dots) \), where \( R \), \( T \), and \( Q \) represent curvature, torsion, and non-metricity scalars. Using the vielbein formalism, we derive the Wald entropy for various subclasses of these models, extending the classical entropy formula to accommodate non-Riemannian geometry. Our focus is on how the additional geometric degrees of freedom modify the entropy expression. The analysis shows that such corrections arise systematically from the extended structure of the action and preserve diffeomorphism invariance. These results refine the theoretical framework for gravitational thermodynamics in extended geometry settings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Cubic Metric-Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M &lt;&lt; 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24833v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending "standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inequalities, black holes and the architecture of typical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR &gt; L_UV. Degrees of freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the ultraviolet (scales &lt; L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales &gt; L_IR). Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated, and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the corona and the outer horizon.</description>

      <title>Joule-Thomson expansion for quantum corrected AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom black holes in Kiselev spacetime with Barrow fractal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we detect the difference in the effects of the quantum corrections included in the metric of a spacetime and the quantum corrections included in the entropy of such a system? Recently, J. Barrow designed an expression based directly on black hole (BH) entropy of Bekenstein-Hawking where the geometry of the event horizon can also have an intricate, non smooth, structure, a fractal geometry. These fractal features are represented by a numerical constant parameter, the fractal parameter (FP). Since then, several interesting issues have been explored in the literature. In this work, we investigate the inversion temperature connected to the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom BH by using the Barrow entropy equation where the FP has several values within a certain validity interval. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems also involves numerical solutions concerning the FP. The results are shown by temperature-pressure curves for multiple values of the parameters of the system used here. In conclusion of our analysis, we also show isenthalpic curves corresponding to fixed-mass BH processes, and we respond numerically to the question made in the first line of this abstract.</description>

      <title>The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A Case for an Inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our local-to-global cosmological framework, cosmic acceleration arises from local dynamics in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe without invoking dark energy. An iEdS universe follows a quasilinear coasting evolution from an Einstein-de Sitter to a Milne state, as an effective negative curvature emerges from growing inhomogeneities without breaking spatial flatness. Acceleration can arise from structure formation amplifying this effect. We test two realizations, iEdS(1) and iEdS(2), with $H_0=\{70.24,74.00\}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=\{0.290,0.261\}$, against CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. iEdS(1) fits better than $\Lambda$CDM and alleviates the $H_0$ tension, whereas iEdS(2) fully resolves it while remaining broadly consistent with the data. Both models yield ${t_0\simeq13.64\ \mathrm{Gyr}}$, consistent with globular-cluster estimates.</description>

      <title>Oscillon decay via parametric resonance: the case of three-point scalar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the decay dynamics of oscillons through interactions with an external scalar field. To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point interaction $g_3\phi\chi^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external field $\chi$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes. Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.</description>

      <title>The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>

      <title>Scrambling or Stalling: Angular Momentum Barriers to Chaos in Holographic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling is a diagnostic of quantum chaos in strongly coupled systems, and plays a central role in the holographic description of black hole dynamics. We study scrambling in high-temperature holographic CFTs, with an emphasis on perturbations dual to particles on infalling and bound trajectories in the bulk description. For BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild geometries, we derive an analytic expression relating the difference in scrambling times to the particles' kinematics. We match this to a 2d CFT computation by constructing the smeared operator that creates the bulk particle with the desired kinematics and calculating the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). For higher-dimensional holographic CFTs, the scrambling slows and eventually ceases when the dual bulk particle has insufficient energy to overcome the angular momentum barrier.</description>

Abstract: Low-frequency superconducting lumped-element resonators have recently attracted significant attention in the context of axion dark matter searches. Here we present the design and implementation of a fixed-frequency superconducting resonator operating near $250~\mathrm{kHz}$, possessing an inductor volume of $\sim 1$ liter and achieving an unloaded quality factor $Q \approx 2.1\times10^{6}$. This resonator represents a significant improvement over the state of the art and informs the design of searches for low-mass axions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the bimetric formalism, we compute the production and emission rates of light spin-2 particles in non-degenerate stellar interiors through photoproduction and bremsstrahlung processes, including the effects of plasma screening. By comparing the resulting energy-loss rates with observational limits on stellar cooling, we derive bounds on the coupling strength and mass of the spin-2 particle. Assuming these particles are the dark matter of the Universe, the obtained constraints are competitive with existing astrophysical and cosmological limits, excluding a wide region of parameter space in the mass range 5-30 eV.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quantum-mechanical counterpart of Newtonian cosmology and show that effects of zero-point motion eliminate classical density singularity. Quantum effects are particularly significant for closed Universes where without the cosmological constant the energy spectrum and space curvature are quantized. When small positive cosmological constant is included, these states become quasi-stationary and decay via tunneling. Corresponding metastable Universes evolve in three stages: long period of gestation followed by rapid tunneling expansion further followed by slower Hubble expansion. This closely resembles inflation scenario of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime and to test gravity theories. These modes extend the standard gravitational wave polarization paradigm and provide novel observational signatures for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a one-component time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved space-time solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski space-time exists. However, it is surprising that non-trivial solutions can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\), is satisfied. We argue that naturally these solutions are not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown \emph{fine-tuning} mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, the naked singularities and the photon sphere of these novel but peculiar solutions are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunneling processes offer a promising path for finding signatures of quantum gravity. While tunneling of geometry has long been recognized in the literature, few detailed analyses in covariant Loop Quantum Gravity have been carried out. We investigate spinfoam transitions in the holonomy representation, which naturally encodes the extrinsic curvature of boundary states. To reduce technical complications to a minimum, we study these amplitudes within the simple framework of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam model for three-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. We identify the geometries dominating the spinfoam path integral in the classically forbidden regime when formulated in terms of dihedral angles as boundary data. We characterize these non-classical geometries and show that their contributions to the spinfoam amplitude are exponentially suppressed in the semiclassical limit via analytic continuation of the discrete gravity action. We argue that they satisfy all the desired properties of tunneling processes. We also shed light on quantum black-to-white-hole transitions, in particular clarifying the origin of the exponential suppression of various quantum amplitudes, while at the same time laying the basis for a future complete calculation of the amplitude in covariant Loop Quantum Gravity.</description>

Abstract: A recent article (Ramadhan et al. Eur Phys J C 83:465, 2023) suggested that the Sagittarius A* black hole cannot be modeled by an Ayon-Beato-Garcia regular black hole due to the incompatible shadow radius. However, they overlooked the distant-observer limit of the correction term in the effective geometry, which renders their calculation invalid. When evaluated correctly, the result reverses the conclusion of the paper. This comment highlights the flaw and demonstrates how to properly compute the shadow radius of such a black hole model using elementary geometry.</description>

Abstract: Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE, despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is possible, and why this makes the GIE experiments an even more urgent matter in quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Operator growth and black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When two particles collide in an asymptotically AdS spacetime with high enough energy and small enough impact parameter, they can form a black hole. Motivated by dual quantum circuit considerations, we propose a threshold condition for black hole formation. Intuitively the condition can be understood as the onset of overlap of the butterfly cones describing the ballistic spread of the effect of the perturbations on the boundary systems. We verify the correctness of the condition in three bulk dimensions. We describe a six-point correlation function that can diagnose this condition and compute it in two-dimensional CFTs using eikonal resummation.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum variational calculus on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice and modified energy-momentum relations.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Massless Scalar Partition Function on General Stationary Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high temperature equilibrium partition function of a massless real scalar field nonminimally coupled to the scalar curvature is computed at second order in the derivative expansion on a generic stationary background. Using covariant perturbation theory, the expression of the thermal partition function at second order in powers of curvatures is also obtained, including its nonlocal contributions. For conformal coupling, the Weyl anomaly at fourth order in derivatives and second order in curvatures is evaluated using both expansions and the results found to be consistent.</description>

      <title>Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that a simple redefinition of the regularizing parameter in regular black hole (RBH) metrics can preserve the self-similarity of the evaporation process. This implies that a RBH can evaporate completely, mirroring the behavior of its singular counterpart. Consequently, RBHs need not evolve into exotic, unverified remnant states such as horizonless compact objects or wormholes. We then provide a generic framework to study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). As illustrative examples, we explicitly work out the cases of the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric. The formalism can be readily applied to other metrics. RPBH generally exhibits different Hawking temperature and horizon size compared to their singular counterpart, leading to distinct lifetime and mass evolution. We calculate the resulting modified cosmological constraints and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance. This intriguing scenario provides a unified resolution to both the DM problem and the black hole singularity problem, while preserving the standard self-similar evaporation process.</description>

      <title>No, classical gravity does not entangle quantized matter fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their recent work [Nature,646,813(2025)], Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantized) gravity produces entanglement of quantized matter if matter is treated within quantum field theory which is, no doubt, our ultimate theory to use. However, an elementary quantum field re-calculation of the authors' example shows that there is no entangling effect.</description>
