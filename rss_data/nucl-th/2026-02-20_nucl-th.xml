      <title>From $\chi$EFT to Multi-Region Modeling: Neutron star structure with a polytropic extension of $\chi$EFT and MUSES Calculation Engine multi-layer modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique environment to probe the properties of dense nuclear matter. In this work, we present a comparative study between two approaches to modeling the neutron star structure: a Chiral Effective Field Theory based approach and the MUSES Calculation Engine framework, which uses three different approaches for the three density regions. We analyze the resulting mass-radius relations, discussing the respective advantages and limitations of the two methods.</description>

      <title>Spectra and elliptic flow of light hadrons in an expanding fire-cylinder model for the RHIC Beam Energy Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse momentum spectra ($p_T$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ produced in peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7$, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis is carried out within an expanding elliptic fire-cylinder model that incorporates longitudinal expansion and anisotropic transverse flow. Particle production at kinetic freeze-out is obtained using a local equilibrium distribution function with a blast-wave-like fluid velocity profile derived from the expansion dynamics of the elliptic fire-cylinder. The model parameters governing the collective expansion are first constrained by fitting the midrapidity $p_T$ spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$ and are then applied, without further adjustment, to $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$. The model provides a consistent description of the $p_T$ spectra and reproduces the qualitative behavior of the elliptic flow for all considered particle species.</description>

      <title>Model bias and parameter optimisation with the example of INCL/ABLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy and precision of high-energy spallation models play a crucial role in the design and development of new applications and experiments, as well as in data analysis. We discuss the complementarity between parameter optimisation and model bias estimation approaches within a Bayesian framework. This is illustrated using the IntraNuclear Cascade model of Li\`ege (INCL) together with the Ablation model (ABLA), for which these two approaches for model bias estimation have been applied independently in previous works.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in non-zero isospin chemical potential environment at $T \simeq 0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the isospin asymmetry affects quarkonium states in QCD at near zero temperature. Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $\mu_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $\mu_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $\lambda a = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_\pi = 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $\mu_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $\mu_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic.</description>

      <title>Hartree shift and pairing gap in ultracold Fermi gases in the framework of low-momentum interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a two-component gas of fermions on the BCS side of the BCS-BEC crossover at zero temperature. We use a momentum dependent interaction that reproduces the s-wave scattering phase shifts of a contact interaction up to a momentum cutoff that is scaled with the Fermi momentum. Using a diagrammatic formulation of Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory, suitably augmented by self-consistency conditions, we obtain the Hartree shift and the pairing gap to third order. In the weak-coupling regime, our results are not only well-converged but also agree with the well-established Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections for the gap and the Galitskii result for the Hartree shift. Near the unitary regime, our results for the Nambu-Gor'kov self-energy are less converged, but there is still reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with quantum Monte-Carlo results. Perspectives for improvements and applications of this approach to neutron matter are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration effects onto the meson spectrum from a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light meson spectra are studied in a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach to QCD. By varying the interaction strength of three sets of models for the quark-antiquark interaction, the transition from the chiral symmetric to the chirally broken regime in the vacuum is studied. The simplest type of these models leads to degenerate meson spectra for a large domain of the strength parameter. The more sophisticated and thus more realistic models show significantly smaller parameter domains for which degenerate meson spectra are obtained. The underlying mechanism for obtaining and then lifting degeneracies is traced back to the location of the quark propagators' poles, in particular, whether they are beyond or within the domain of integration in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In view of this mechanism the potential relation of the obtained degeneracies to the dynamical emergence of symmetries is discussed, adding thereby another point of view on the conjectured chiral spin symmetry of QCD in the temperature domain right above the crossover.</description>

      <title>Hyperon longitudinal polarization and vector meson spin alignment in a thermal model for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a common local spin equilibrium for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles is incorporated into a thermal model of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. We show that an effective spin polarization tensor leading to a correct description of the longitudinal spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons simultaneously yields a positive alignment of vector mesons ($\phi$ and $K^{*0}$) that grows monotonically with transverse momentum and centrality. Similar trends can be seen in the data, suggesting a possible common mechanism for longitudinal spin polarization and alignment. However, model calculations are insufficient to explain the data in a fully quantitative way. The correlation found between the magnitude of the $\Lambda$ longitudinal polarization and vector meson alignment suggests further more elaborate investigations of this issue.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars (NS) is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. We investigate the existence of hybrid stars, using microscopic models to describe different phases of matter. Within the adopted microscopic models we calculate properties of NS and properties of matter. We want to probe the pQCD calculations influence and analyze properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. Bayesian approach is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state (EOS). A Maxwell construction is adopted to describe the deconfinement transition. For the hadron phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with nonlinear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use 2 different models: the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, a model similar to the vector MIT bag model. Bayesian inference was applied to determine the model parameters that satisfy the X-ray observations from NICER and have phase transition at densities between 0.15 - 0.40 fm$^{-3}$. We also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations to half of the sets. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The pQCD restrictions reduce the value of the $M_{max}$. However, even applying this restriction, the models were able to reach values of $2.1 - 2.3 M_\odot$. The conformal limit was still not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above $2 M_\odot$. The multiquark interactions introduced may affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, gravitational wave data from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at low densities, just above saturation density, while for the NJL sets, the phase transition occurs above twice the saturation density. As a result, the MFTQCD model predicts the presence of quark matter in the inner core of 1.4 M$_\odot$ NSs, while NJL models suggest a low probability of quark matter in the interior of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS. Both models predict the existence of quark matter in 2 M$_\odot$ NSs. The slope of the mass-radius curve has been shown to carry information about the presence of quark matter. In particular, a positive slope at 1.8 M$_\odot$ indicates the presence of non-nucleonic matter. A hybrid star with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius in more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, compared to canonical NSs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$ with a Skyrme pseudopotential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed density-, momentum- and isospin-dependent N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>DeepQuark: A Deep-Neural-Network Approach to Multiquark Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</description>

Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamic matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a static and time-varying magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of resonances from $\pi\pi$ scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $\rho(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $\rho_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $\pi \pi$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible datasets. Depending on the dataset we find poles for the $\rho(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $\rho(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.</description>
