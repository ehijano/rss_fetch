      <title>First homology groups of the Milnor fiber boundary for generic hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Milnor fiber boundary for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$. This is one of the examples of non-isolated surface singularities, which are studied by N\'emethi--Szil\'ard. In this paper, we compute the first homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary for a generic arrangement and prove it is combinatorially determined. In particular, this gives the affirmative answer to the conjecture of Suciu.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of algebraic fibers of group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey describes some recent work, by the authors and others, on the existence of algebraic fibrations of group extensions, as well as the finiteness properties of their algebraic fibers, in the realm of both abstract and pro-$p$ groups. We also discuss some applications of these results to (higher) coherence.</description>

      <title>Homotopy commutativity in quasitoric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the loop space of a quasitoric manifold is homotopy commutative if and only if the underlying polytope is $(\Delta^3)^n$ and the characteristic matrix is equivalent to a matrix of certain type. We also construct for each $n\ge 2$ and a positive integer $k$, a quasitoric manifold $M(k,n)$ over $(\Delta^3)^n$ such that its loop space is homotopy commutative if and only if $k$ is even, where every quasitoric manifold over $\Delta^3$ is equivalent to $\mathbb{C} P^3$ whose loop space is homotopy commutative.</description>

      <title>Approximating hyperbolic lattices by cubulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an isometric action of a torsion-free uniform lattice $\Gamma$ on hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ can be metrically approximated by geometric actions of $\Gamma$ on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes, provided that either $n$ is at most three, or the lattice is arithmetic of simplest type. This solves a conjecture of Futer and Wise.
  Our main tool is the study of a space of co-geodesic currents, consisting of invariant Radon measures supported on codimension-1 hyperspheres in the Gromov boundary of $\mathbb{H}^n$. By pairing co-geodesic currents and geodesic currents via an intersection number, we show that asymptotic convergence of geometric actions can be deduced from the convergence of their dual co-geodesic currents.
  For surface groups, our methods also imply approximation by cubulations for actions induced by non-positively curved Riemannian surfaces with singularities, Hitchin and maximal representations, and quasiFuchsian representations.</description>

      <title>A class of open surfaces with algorithmically solvable homeomorphism problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2818</link>
      <description>arXiv:1209.2818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of possibly noncompact n-dimensional manifolds without boundary associated to finite data which we call topological automata. This class is large enough to contain many interesting examples of open 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional manifolds of interest to low-dimensional topologists. Our main result is that the homeomorphism problem in this class is decidable for n = 2.</description>

      <title>Garoufalidis-Levine's finite type invariants for $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences from 3-manifolds to the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.08462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Garoufalidis and Levine defined a filtration for 3-manifolds equipped with some degree 1 map ($\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalence) to a fixed 3-manifold $N$ and showed that there is a natural surjection from a space of $\pi=\pi_1N$-decorated graphs to the graded quotient of the filtration over $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$. In this paper, we show that in the case of $N=T^3$ the surjection of Garoufalidis--Levine is actually an isomorphism over $\mathbb{Q}$. For the proof, we construct a perturbative invariant by applying Fukaya's Morse homotopy theoretic construction to a local system of the quotient field of $\mathbb{Q}\pi$. The first invariant is an extension of the Casson invariant to $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences to the 3-torus. The results of this paper suggest that there is a highly nontrivial equivariant quantum invariants for 3-manifolds with $b_1=3$. We also discuss some generalizations of the perturbative invariant for other target spaces $N$.</description>

      <title>The compact-open topology on the diffeomorphism or homeomorphism group of a smooth manifold without boundary is minimal in almost all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any connected smooth manifold $M$ of dimension different from $3$ the restriction of the compact-open topology to the diffeomorphism group of $M$ is minimal, i.e. the group does not admit a strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology. This implies the minimality of the compact-open topology on the homeomorphism group of $M$ in all dimensions different from $3$ and $4$. In those cases for which in addition to all of this automatic continuity is known to hold, such as when $M$ is closed, one can conclude that the compact-open topology is the unique separable Hausdorff group topology on the homeomorphism group.</description>

      <title>Knot Mosaics with Corner Connection Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A knot mosaic is a representation of a knot or link on a square grid using a collection of tiles that are either blank or contain a portion of the knot diagram. Traditionally, a piece of the knot on one tile connects to a piece of the knot on an adjacent tile at a connection point that is located at the midpoint of a tile edge. We introduce a new set of tiles in which the connection points are located at corners of the tile. By doing this, we can create more efficient knot mosaics for knots with small crossing number. In particular, when using these corner connection tiles, it is possible to create knot mosaic diagrams for all knots with crossing number 8 or less on a mosaic that is no larger and uses fewer non-blank tiles than is possible using the traditional tiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a generalized piecewise-linear (PL) version of Morse theory due to Grunert-Kuhnel-Rote to define and study new local and global notions of topological complexity for fully-connected feedforward ReLU neural network functions, F: R^n -&gt; R. Along the way, we show how to construct, for each such F, a canonical polytopal complex K(F) and a deformation retract of the domain onto K(F), yielding a convenient compact model for performing calculations. We also give a construction showing that local complexity can be arbitrarily high.</description>

      <title>Reducible Suspensions of Anosov Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study through the lens of Anosov representations the dynamical properties of reducible suspensions of linear representations of non-elementary hyperbolic groups, which are linear representations preserving and acting weakly unipotently on a proper non-zero subspace. We characterize when reducible suspensions are discrete and (almost) faithful, quasi-isometrically embedded, and Anosov. Anosov reducible suspensions correspond to points in bounded convex domains in a finite-dimensional real vector space. Stronger characterizations of such domains for symmetric Anosov representations allow us to find deformations of Borel Anosov representations which retain some but not all of the Anosov conditions and to compute examples of non-Anosov limits of Anosov representations.</description>

      <title>Positive Ricci Curvature on Twisted Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twisted suspension of a manifold is obtained by surgery along the fibre of a principal circle bundle over the manifold. It generalizes the spinning operation for knots and preserves various topological properties. In this article, we show that Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature can be lifted along twisted suspensions. As an application we show that the maximal symmetry rank of a closed, simply-connected Riemannian manifold of positive Ricci curvature is $(n-2)$ in all dimensions $n\geq 4$. Further applications include simply-connected 6-manifolds whose homology has torsion, (rational) homology spheres in all dimensions at least 4, and manifolds with prescribed third homology.</description>
