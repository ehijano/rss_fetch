      <title>Questioning whether seasonal advance of intense tropical cyclones since the 1980s truly exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shan et al. (2023) recently reported significant seasonal advances of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) since the 1980s and emphasized the data insensitivity of this conclusion, based on the advanced Dvorak Technique-Hurricane Satellite (ADT-HURSAT) and the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) datasets. However, upon rigorously repeating the analysis procedure in Shan et al. (2023), we are unable to replicate their conclusion. Our analyses reveal that insignificant trends in median of intense TC occurrence dates (hereafter referred to as $\tilde{date}_{intenseTC}$) are observed in the SH based on the ADT-HURSAT, and in both hemispheres based on the IBTrACS. In addition, we discover inconsistencies in $\tilde{date}_{intenseTC}$ trends between the two datasets, which primarily arise from the differences in identification of intense TC cases. The above discrepancies raise doubts about the reproducibility and validity of Shan et al.'s conclusions regarding the seasonal advance of intense TCs. Based on these findings, as well as the limitations of both datasets, we argue that the reported seasonal advance of intense TCs since the 1980s is inconclusive and further investigations with alternative datasets and approaches are needed.</description>

      <title>Energy deposition in air by moderately focused femtosecond laser filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filamentation of high-power femtosecond laser pulses in air is accompanied by a fairly strong release of optical energy into the propagation medium due to laser-induced ionization of air molecules and production of an underdense plasma of charged species. We present the results of our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations aimed to the estimation of energy deposition amount by laser filament upon propagation in air depending on the conditions of spatial focusing, pulse energy, and radiation wavelength. For the first time to our knowledge, our study reveals a more than 50% decrease in the filament energy deposited in air in the range of moderate numerical aperture values, approximately from 0.003 to 0.007, at the carrier wavelengths of 740 nm and 470 nm. We attribute such a considerable reduction in the laser pulse energy release for femtosecond plasma to the competing effects of Kerr self-focusing and geometric divergence of focused laser pulse.</description>

      <title>A methodology for realistic estimation of the aerosol impact on the solar potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric aerosol loading may significantly influence the performance in solar power production. The impact can be very different both in space (even in short distance) and time (shortterm fluctuations as well as long-term trend). Aiming to ensure a high degree of generality, this study is focused on the aerosol impact on the collectable solar energy. Thus, the results are independent of solar plants characteristics. A new methodology for estimating the average daily,monthly, and yearly losses in the solar potential due to aerosols is proposed. For highlighting the loss in the overall solar potential, a new ideal scenario is defined as a reference for the atmospheric aerosol background. A new equation for computing the solar potential loss is proposed to adjust for possible biases. In a departure from similar studies, the analysis relies on ground measurements (BSRN and AERONET), always more accurate than remotely sensed satellite data. The seldom discussed impact of aerosol type is considered. As a general conclusion, the monthly and yearly reductions of the solar potential due to aerosols are estimated at 12 locations spread around the globe, amounting to losses of the solar potential ranging from 0.6% to as high as 7.2%.</description>

      <title>Towards an end-to-end artificial intelligence driven global weather forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weather forecasting system is important for science and society, and significant achievements have been made in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to medium-range weather forecasting. However, existing AI-based weather forecasting models rely on analysis or reanalysis products from the traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems as initial conditions for making predictions. Initial states are typically generated by traditional data assimilation component, which is computational expensive and time-consuming. Here we present an AI-based data assimilation model, i.e., Adas, for global weather variables. And we combine Adas with the advanced AI-based weather forecasting model (i.e., FengWu) to construct the first end-to-end AI-based global weather forecasting system: FengWu-Adas. We demonstrate that Adas can assimilate sparse global observations to produce high-quality analysis, enabling the system operate stably for long term. Moreover, we are the first to apply the propose methods to real-world scenarios, which is more challenging and has considerable practical application potential.</description>
