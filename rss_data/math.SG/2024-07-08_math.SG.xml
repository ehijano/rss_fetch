      <title>On A Potential Contact Analogue Of Kirby Move Of Type 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we explore the possibility of the existence of Kirby move of type 1 for contact surgery diagrams. In particular, we give the necessary conditions on a contact surgery diagram to become a potential candidate for contact Kirby move of type 1. We prove that no other contact integral surgery diagram satisfies those conditions except for contact $(+2)$-surgery on Legendrian unknot with Thruston--Bennequin number $-1$.</description>

      <title>On non-elliptic symplectic manifolds</title>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$ with non-ellipticity. We can define an almost K\"ahler structure on $M$ by using the given symplectic form. Hence, we have a $\G=\pi_1(M)$-invariant almost K\"ahler structure on the universal covering, $\ti M$, of $M$. Using Darboux coordinate charts, we globally deform the given almost K\"ahler structure on $\ti M$ off a Lebesgue measure zero subset to obtain a $\G$-invariant Lipschitz K\"ahler flat structure on $\ti M$ which is $\G$-homotopy equivalent to the given almost K\"ahler structure. Analogous to Teleman's $L^2$-Hodge decomposition on PL manifolds or Lipschitz Riemannian manifolds, we give a $L^2$-Hodge decomposition theorem on $\ti M$ with respect to the Lipschitz K\"ahler flat metric. Using an argument of Gromov, we give a vanishing theorem for $L^2$ harmonic $p$-forms, $p\not=n$ (resp. a non-vanishing theorem for $L^2$ harmonic $n$-forms) on $\ti M$, then the signed Euler characteristic satisfies $(-1)^n\chi(M)\geq0$ (resp. $(-1)^n\chi(M)&gt;0$). Similarly, for any closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, we can construct a $\G$-invariant Lipschitz K\"ahler flat structure on the universal covering, $(\ti M, \ti g)$, of $(M, g)$ which is $\G$-homotopy equivalent to and quasi-isometric to the metric $\ti g$. As an application, using Gromov's method we show that the Chern-Hopf conjecture holds true in closed even dimensional Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive curvature (resp. strictly negative curvature), it gives a positive answer to a Yau's problem due to S. S. Chern and H. Hopf.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Floer theory for trivalent graphs and homological mirror symmetry for curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry for higher genus curves is usually formulated and studied in terms of Landau-Ginzburg models; however the critical locus of the superpotential is arguably of greater intrinsic relevance to mirror symmetry than the whole Landau-Ginzburg model. Accordingly, we propose a new approach to the A-model of the mirror, viewed as a trivalent configuration of rational curves together with some extra data at the nodal points. In this context, we introduce a version of Lagrangian Floer theory and the Fukaya category for trivalent graphs, and show that homological mirror symmetry holds, namely, that the Fukaya category of a trivalent configuration of rational curves is equivalent to the derived category of a non-Archimedean generalized Tate curve. To illustrate the concrete nature of this equivalence, we show how explicit formulas for theta functions and for the canonical map of the curve arise naturally under mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Closed string mirrors of symplectic cluster manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the base $B$ of a Maslov $0$ Lagrangian torus fibration with singularities consider the sheaf assigning to each $P\subset B$ the relative symplectic cohomology in degree $0$ of its pre-image. We compute this sheaf for nodal Lagrangian torus fibrations on four dimensional symplectic cluster manifolds. We show that it is the pushforward of the structure sheaf of a certain rigid analytic space under a non-archimedean torus fibration. The rigid analytic space is constructed in a canonical way from the relative SH sheaf and is referred as the \emph{closed string mirror}. The construction relies on computing relative SH for local models by applying general axiomatic properties rather than ad hoc analysis of holomorphic curves. These axiomatic properties include previously established ones such as the Mayer-Vietoris property and locality for complete embeddings; and new ones such as the Hartogs property and the holomorphic volume form preservation property of wall crossing in relative $SH$. We indicate some higher dimensional settings where the same techniques apply.</description>

      <title>Morse homology with DG coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Morse homology and cohomology with coefficients in a derived local system, for manifolds and also more generally for colimits of spaces that have the homotopy type of manifolds, with a view towards Floer theory. The model that we adopt for derived, or differential graded (DG) local systems is that of DG modules over chains on the based loop space of a manifold. These encompass both classical (non DG) local systems and chains on fibers of Hurewicz fibrations. We prove that the Morse homology and cohomology groups that we construct are isomorphic to DG Tor and Ext functors. The key ingredient in the definition is a notion of twisting cocycle obtained by evaluating into based loops a coherent system of representatives for the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Morse trajectories of arbitrary dimensions. From this perspective, our construction sits midway between classical Morse homology with twisted coefficients and more refined invariants of Floer homotopical flavor. The construction of the twisting cocycle is originally due to Barraud and Cornea with Z/2-coefficients. We show that the twisting cocycle with integer coefficients is equivalent to Brown's universal twisting cocycle. We prove that Morse homology with coefficients in chains on the fiber of a Hurewicz fibration recovers the homology of the total space of the fibration. We study several structural properties of the theory: invariance, functoriality, and Poincar\'e duality, also in the nonorientable case.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <title>Cohomological splitting over rationally connected bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a cohomological splitting result for Hamiltonian fibrations over enumeratively rationally connected symplectic manifolds As a key application, we prove that the cohomology of a smooth, projective family over a smooth (stably) rational projective variety splits additively over any field. The main ingredients in our arguments include the theory of Fukaya-Ono-Parker (FOP) perturbations developed by the first and third author, which allows one to define integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants, and variants of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith's global Kuranishi charts tailored to concrete geometric problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of hypersurfaces in any contact manifold of dimension 5 and larger that cannot be $C^2$-approximated by convex hypersurfaces. This contrasts sharply with the foundational result of Giroux in dimension $3$ and the work of Honda-Huang in the $C^0$ case. The main technical step is the construction of a Bonatti-Diaz type blender in the contact setting.</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures. Relating this convolution to the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians and using recent results describing the structure constants of the latter, we give a manifestly positive formula for the density of the probability distribution for the product of generic conjugacy classes. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive and explicit formula for the volume of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>
