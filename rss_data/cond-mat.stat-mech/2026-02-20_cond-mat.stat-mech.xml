      <title>Quantifying non-Markovianity in magnetization dynamics via entropy production rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.</description>

      <title>A covariant fermionic path integral for scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the fermionic path-integral representation of overdamped scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise, focusing on the covariance of the generating functional under non-linear changes of variables. We identify the transformations of the auxiliary (commuting and anticommuting) variables that ensure covariance under such transformations. The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics. Upon integrating out the auxiliary variables, we derive the Onsager-Machlup formulation, which agrees with the one recently obtained using a higher-order discretization scheme. In contrast to the latter, the construction proposed here is formulated directly in continuous time.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product operator dualities in integrable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-product operators (MPOs) appear throughout the study of integrable lattice models, notably as the transfer matrices. They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Operational measurement of relativistic equilibrium from stochastic fields alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $\beta^\mu = u^\mu/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $\beta^\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\beta^\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $\beta^\mu$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Dynamical Phase Diagram of the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Spacetime Entropy for Quasifree Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.</description>

      <title>Dissipation as a Resource: Synchronization, Coherence Recovery, and Chaos Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.</description>

      <title>How Continuous Symmetry Stabilizes the Ordered Phase of Polar Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of the ordered phase of compressible polar flocks against the nucleation of counter-propagating droplets, using a combination of analytical theory, microscopic and hydrodynamic simulations. For discrete-symmetry flocks, such droplets are known to always grow and propagate, making the ordered phase metastable. We explain how, on the contrary, continuous symmetry can stabilize the ordered phase at small enough noise by destabilizing the leading edge of growing droplets. Flocking models with continuous symmetries thus have a lower critical dimension than their discrete-symmetry counterparts, in contrast to equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Overdamped limits for Langevin dynamics with position-dependent coefficients via $L^2$-hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note provides a simple derivation of the overdamped approximation for kinetic (or underdamped) equilibrium Langevin dynamics, in cases where certain coefficients depend on the position variable. The equivalent small-mass limit of these dynamics, known as the Kramers--Smoluchowski approximation, in the case of a state-dependent friction coefficient, has been previously studied by a variety of approaches. Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study once-excited random walks on general trees, modeled by placing a single "cookie" at each vertex. Each cookie acts as a metaphorical reward that is consumed upon the first visit to the vertex where the cookie is placed. On that initial visit, the walk is in an excited state and behaves like a biased random walk. Once the cookie is consumed, the process reverts to a symmetric random walk on all subsequent visits. We consider a random environment in which the bias parameters are independent random variables. We prove that the process exhibits a sharp phase transition between transience and recurrence on general trees with polynomial growth, where the critical threshold is determined by the branching-ruin number of the tree.</description>

      <title>Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in coupled Ising chains and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Optimal speed-up of multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates.

      <title>Planckian bound on the local equilibration time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local equilibration time $\tau_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $\tau_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $\tau_{\rm eq} \geq \alpha \hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $\alpha $ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Exotic critical states as fractional Fermi seas in the one-dimensional Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is a cornerstone of quantum physics: it governs the structure of matter. Extensions of this principle, such as Haldane's generalized exclusion statistics, predict the existence of exotic quantum states characterized by fractional Fermi seas (FFS), i.e. momentum distributions with uniform but fractional occupancies. Here, we report the experimental realization of fractional Fermi seas in an excited one-dimensional Bose gas prepared through ramping cycles in the interaction strength. The resulting excited yet stable Bose-gas states exhibit Friedel oscillations, smoking-gun signatures of the underlying FFS. The stabilization of these states offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of exotic statistics and paves the way for applications in quantum information and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 qubits. We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Eggbox Ising model, a tunable construction of rugged energy landscapes defined by distances to a prescribed set of patterns. Correlated pattern ensembles realize arbitrary k-step replica-symmetry-breaking structures and controllable Parisi overlap distributions p(q), consistent with the hierarchical overlap structure observed in a simple word-embedding example from empirical data. A softened variant allows a systematic expansion leading to Hopfield-type couplings (and higher-body terms). We analyze the density of states and show that suitable potentials induce discontinuous finite-temperature transitions with metastability and hysteresis.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the natural bounds of entropy production for driven nonequi- librium dynamics in many-body systems reveals how the fundamentals of thermodynamics manifest in these regimes across a wide variety of systems. In this direction, we propose and study the dynamics of a thermal zero-player entropy game, the Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg), a self-driven system exhibiting characteristics of lattice gases, Ising models, and discrete games. We show that there is a universal bound on the entropy production rate, independent of temperature and lattice size. The thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible testbed for studying the fundamentals of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium maximum entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>Coercivity Landscape Characterizes Dynamic Hysteresis</title>

Abstract: Hysteresis, with rich dynamical behaviors-especially in interacting systems-has drawn broad research interest. Yet its dynamic scalings across time scales lack a unified description, and their transitions remain unclear. Here, we study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model driven periodically by an external field $H$. For large systems with small noise strength $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing driving rate $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the field-driven first-order phase transition point. In the post-plateau regime, $(H_{c} - H_{P})$ scales with $(v_{H} - v_{P})^{2/3}$ with $v_{P}$ and $H_{P}$ being the reference points of the plateau. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau as $v_{P}\sim\sigma^{2}$ and $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of the geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to catalytic branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on absorbing regions of the boundary. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction in a bounded domain. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics, chemistry, and life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D&gt;1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D&lt;1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in dissipative collective spin systems have been extensively studied using numerical, mean-field, and perturbative approaches. However, an explicit Liouvillian description governing the long-time dynamics deep within the time crystal phase has remained elusive. Here, we derive an effective Liouvillian that analytically captures the extreme BTC regime, where dissipation is parametrically weak and oscillatory order is maximally robust. By introducing a superspin representation of Liouville space, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Liouvillian eigenvalues to first order in the dissipation strength, providing direct access to decay rates, oscillation frequencies, and their thermodynamic scaling. Applying this framework to the canonical BTC model we analytically recover spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry and persistent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, we show that other dissipative spin models exhibit only single-frequency oscillatory dynamics and therefore do not support genuine BTC phases. Our results establish a controlled analytical framework for the long-time dynamics in the extreme BTC regime.</description>

      <title>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature$-$supposedly unique to two dimensions$-$that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional (3D) Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-parity and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models</title>

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures</title>

Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce $Krylov$ $staggering$ $parameter$, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic framework exceeding the ultimate hydrogen storage targets: a first-principles multiscale computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14927</link>

Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt% and 50 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;ulti-binding &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ites &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;nited in &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;ovalent-&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganic &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt% and 72.6 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15-20 kJ/mol) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>

      <title>Observing quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved spacetime using programmable quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low-energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from N\'eel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.</description>
