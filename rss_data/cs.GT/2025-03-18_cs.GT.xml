      <title>Queues with inspection cost: To see or not to see?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an M/M/1-type queue where joining attains a known reward, but a known waiting cost is paid per time unit spent queueing. In the 1960s, Naor showed that any arrival optimally joins the queue if its length is less than a known threshold. Yet acquiring knowledge of the queue length often brings an additional cost, e.g., website loading time or data roaming charge. Therefore, our model presents any arrival with three options: join blindly, balk blindly, or pay a known inspection cost to make the optimal joining decision by comparing the queue length to Naor's threshold. In a recent paper, Hassin and Roet-Green prove that a unique Nash equilibrium always exists and classify regions where the equilibrium probabilities are non-zero. We complement these findings with new closed-form expressions for the equilibrium probabilities in the majority of cases. Further, Hassin and Roet-Green show that minimizing inspection cost maximises social welfare. Envisaging a queue operator choosing where to invest, we compare the effects of lowering inspection cost and increasing the queue-joining reward on social welfare. We prove that the former dominates and that the latter can even have a detrimental effect on social welfare.</description>

      <title>Online Assortment and Price Optimization Under Contextual Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an assortment selection and pricing problem in which a seller has $N$ different items available for sale. In each round, the seller observes a $d$-dimensional contextual preference information vector for the user, and offers to the user an assortment of $K$ items at prices chosen by the seller. The user selects at most one of the products from the offered assortment according to a multinomial logit choice model whose parameters are unknown. The seller observes which, if any, item is chosen at the end of each round, with the goal of maximizing cumulative revenue over a selling horizon of length $T$. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that learns from user feedback and achieves a revenue regret of order $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{K T} / L_0 )$ where $L_0$ is the minimum price sensitivity parameter. We also obtain a lower bound of order $\Omega(d \sqrt{T}/ L_0)$ for the regret achievable by any algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed-Loop Parametric Nash Equilibria of Multi-Agent Collaborative Field Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a challenging and active field of research due to the inherent nonstationary property and coupling between agents. A popular approach to modeling the multi-agent interactions underlying the multi-agent RL problem is the Markov Game. There is a special type of Markov Game, termed Markov Potential Game, which allows us to reduce the Markov Game to a single-objective optimal control problem where the objective function is a potential function. In this work, we prove that a multi-agent collaborative field coverage problem, which is found in many engineering applications, can be formulated as a Markov Potential Game, and we can learn a parameterized closed-loop Nash Equilibrium by solving an equivalent single-objective optimal control problem. As a result, our algorithm is 10x faster during training compared to a game-theoretic baseline and converges faster during policy execution.</description>

      <title>Non-Normalized Solutions of Generalized Nash Equilibrium in Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamic games with shared constraints, Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE) are often computed using the normalized solution concept, which assumes identical Lagrange multipliers for shared constraints across all players. While widely used, this approach excludes other potentially valuable GNE. This paper addresses the limitations of normalized solutions in racing scenarios through three key contributions. First, we highlight the shortcomings of normalized solutions with a simple racing example. Second, we propose a novel method based on the Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) formulation to compute non-normalized Generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE). Third, we demonstrate that our proposed method overcomes the limitations of normalized GNE solutions and enables richer multi-modal interactions in realistic racing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bi-Criteria Optimization for Combinatorial Bandits: Sublinear Regret and Constraint Violation under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study bi-criteria optimization for combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with bandit feedback. We propose a general framework that transforms discrete bi-criteria offline approximation algorithms into online algorithms with sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) guarantees. Our framework requires the offline algorithm to provide an $(\alpha, \beta)$-bi-criteria approximation ratio with $\delta$-resilience and utilize $\texttt{N}$ oracle calls to evaluate the objective and constraint functions. We prove that the proposed framework achieves sub-linear regret and CCV, with both bounds scaling as ${O}\left(\delta^{2/3} \texttt{N}^{1/3}T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T)\right)$. Crucially, the framework treats the offline algorithm with $\delta$-resilience as a black box, enabling flexible integration of existing approximation algorithms into the CMAB setting. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply our framework to several combinatorial problems, including submodular cover, submodular cost covering, and fair submodular maximization. These applications highlight the framework's broad utility in adapting offline guarantees to online bi-criteria optimization under bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>Identifying Cooperative Personalities in Multi-agent Contexts through Personality Steering with Representation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain autonomous capabilities, their coordination in multi-agent settings becomes increasingly important. However, they often struggle with cooperation, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by Axelrod's Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, we explore how personality traits influence LLM cooperation. Using representation engineering, we steer Big Five traits (e.g., Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) in LLMs and analyze their impact on IPD decision-making. Our results show that higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness improve cooperation but increase susceptibility to exploitation, highlighting both the potential and limitations of personality-based steering for aligning AI agents.</description>

      <title>Proportional Aggregation of Preferences for Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair sequential decision making given voter preferences. In each round, a decision rule must choose a decision from a set of alternatives where each voter reports which of these alternatives they approve. Instead of going with the most popular choice in each round, we aim for proportional representation across rounds, using axioms inspired by the multi-winner voting literature. The axioms require that every group of $\alpha\%$ of the voters that agrees in every round (i.e., approves a common alternative), must approve at least $\alpha\%$ of the decisions. A stronger version of the axioms requires that every group of $\alpha\%$ of the voters that agrees in a $\beta$ fraction of rounds must approve $\beta\cdot\alpha\%$ of the decisions. We show that three attractive voting rules satisfy axioms of this style. One of them (Sequential Phragm\'en) makes its decisions online, and the other two satisfy strengthened versions of the axioms but make decisions semi-online (Method of Equal Shares) or fully offline (Proportional Approval Voting). We present empirical results for these rules based on synthetic data and U.S. political elections. We also run experiments using the moral machine dataset about ethical dilemmas: We train preference models on user responses from different countries and let the models cast votes. We find that aggregating these votes using our rules leads to a more equal utility distribution across demographics than making decisions using a single global preference model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Mechanisms for Consumer Surplus Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing auctions which maximize consumer surplus (i.e., the social welfare minus the payments charged to the buyers). In the consumer surplus maximization problem, a seller with a set of goods faces a set of strategic buyers with private values, each of whom aims to maximize their own individual utility. The seller, in contrast, aims to allocate the goods in a way which maximizes the total buyer utility. The seller must then elicit the values of the buyers in order to decide what goods to award each buyer. The canonical approach in mechanism design to ensure truthful reporting of the private information is to find appropriate prices to charge each buyer in order to align their objective with the objective of the seller. Indeed, there are many celebrated results to this end when the seller's objective is welfare maximization [Clarke, 1971, Groves, 1973, Vickrey, 1961] or revenue maximization [Myerson, 1981]. However, in the case of consumer surplus maximization the picture is less clear -- using high payments to ensure the highest value bidders are served necessarily decreases their surplus utility, but using low payments may lead the seller into serving lower value bidders.
  Our main result in this paper is a framework for designing mechanisms which maximize consumer surplus. We instantiate our framework in a variety of canonical multi-parameter auction settings (i.e., unit-demand bidders with heterogeneous items, multi-unit auctions, and auctions with divisible goods) and use it to design auctions achieving consumer surplus with optimal approximation guarantees against the total social welfare. Along the way, we answer an open question posed by Hartline and Roughgarden [2008] for the two bidders single item setting.</description>

      <title>On Tractable $\Phi$-Equilibria in Non-Concave Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though they exist, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by Greenwald and Jafari [2003], which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games [Stolz and Lugosi, 2007]. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that converges to the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications. We show that approximating local $\Phi$-equilibria beyond the first-order stationary regime is computationally intractable. In contrast, within this regime, we show Online Gradient Descent efficiently converges to $\Phi$-equilibria for several natural infinite families of modifications, including a new structural family of modifications inspired by the well-studied proximal operator.</description>

      <title>Exact Maximin Share Fairness via Adjusted Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses fair allocation of indivisible items in settings wherein it is feasible to create copies of resources or dispose of tasks. We establish that exact maximin share (MMS) fairness can be achieved via limited duplication of goods even under monotone valuations. We also show that, when allocating chores under monotone costs, MMS fairness is always feasible with limited disposal of chores. Since monotone valuations do not admit any nontrivial approximation guarantees for MMS, our results highlight that such barriers can be circumvented by post facto adjustments in the supply of the items.
  We prove that, for division of $m$ goods among $n$ agents with monotone valuations, there always exists an assignment of subsets of goods to the agents such that they receive at least their maximin shares and no single good is allocated to more than $3 \log m$ agents. In addition, the sum of the sizes of the assigned subsets does not exceed $m$. For identically ordered valuations, we obtain an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{\log m})$ on the maximum assignment multiplicity across goods and an $m + \widetilde{O}\left(\frac{m}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$ bound for the total number of goods assigned. Further, for additive valuations, we prove that there always exists an MMS assignment in which no single good is allocated to more than $2$ agents and the total number of goods assigned is at most $2m$.
  For chores, we upper bound the number of chores that need to be discarded for ensuring MMS fairness. We prove that, under monotone costs, there exists an MMS assignment in which at most $\frac{m}{e}$ remain unassigned. For identically ordered costs, we establish that MMS fairness can be achieved while keeping at most $\widetilde{O} \left(\frac{m}{n^{1/4}} \right)$ chores unassigned. We also prove that the obtained bounds for monotone valuations and monotone costs are essentially tight.</description>

      <title>WeShap: Weak Supervision Source Evaluation with Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient data annotation stands as a significant bottleneck in training contemporary machine learning models. The Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) pipeline presents a solution by utilizing multiple weak supervision sources to automatically label data, thereby expediting the annotation process. Given the varied contributions of these weak supervision sources to the accuracy of PWS, it is imperative to employ a robust and efficient metric for their evaluation. This is crucial not only for understanding the behavior and performance of the PWS pipeline but also for facilitating corrective measures.
  In our study, we introduce WeShap values as an evaluation metric, which quantifies the average contribution of weak supervision sources within a proxy PWS pipeline, leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of Shapley values. We demonstrate efficient computation of WeShap values using dynamic programming, achieving quadratic computational complexity relative to the number of weak supervision sources.
  Our experiments demonstrate the versatility of WeShap values across various applications, including the identification of beneficial or detrimental labeling functions, refinement of the PWS pipeline, and rectification of mislabeled data. Furthermore, WeShap values aid in comprehending the behavior of the PWS pipeline and scrutinizing specific instances of mislabeled data. Although initially derived from a specific proxy PWS pipeline, we empirically demonstrate the generalizability of WeShap values to other PWS pipeline configurations.
  Our findings indicate a noteworthy average improvement of 5.0 points in downstream model accuracy through the revision of the PWS pipeline compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the efficacy of WeShap values in enhancing data quality for training machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Performative Reinforcement Learning with Linear Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the setting of \emph{performative reinforcement learning} where the deployed policy affects both the reward, and the transition of the underlying Markov decision process. Prior work~\parencite{MTR23} has addressed this problem under the tabular setting and established last-iterate convergence of repeated retraining with iteration complexity explicitly depending on the number of states. In this work, we generalize the results to \emph{linear Markov decision processes} which is the primary theoretical model of large-scale MDPs. The main challenge with linear MDP is that the regularized objective is no longer strongly convex and we want a bound that scales with the dimension of the features, rather than states which can be infinite. Our first result shows that repeatedly optimizing a regularized objective converges to a \emph{performatively stable policy}. In the absence of strong convexity, our analysis leverages a new recurrence relation that uses a specific linear combination of optimal dual solutions for proving convergence. We then tackle the finite sample setting where the learner has access to a set of trajectories drawn from the current policy. We consider a reparametrized version of the primal problem, and construct an empirical Lagrangian which is to be optimized from the samples. We show that, under a \emph{bounded coverage} condition, repeatedly solving a saddle point of this empirical Lagrangian converges to a performatively stable solution, and also construct a primal-dual algorithm that solves the empirical Lagrangian efficiently. Finally, we show several applications of the general framework of performative RL including multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search over one another in contexts ranging from marriage to employment -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun using AI clones to evaluate potential pairings between users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones, and their imperfect representation of humans. Individual personalities are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations of these personalities. I compare two search regimes: an ``in-person regime'' -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an ``AI representation regime'' -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a better expected match than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>
