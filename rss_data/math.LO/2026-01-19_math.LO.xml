      <title>Symmetric Iterations with Countable Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for iterated symmetric extensions with countable support. At limit stages of uncountable cofinality we use the direct-limit presentation; at limits of cofinality $\omega$ we use a countable-support (inverse-limit) presentation via trees of conditions along a fixed cofinal sequence. We define the associated limit symmetry filter by head pushforwards and then (only at cf$(\lambda)=\omega)$ closing under countable intersections in the minimal normal way, and we prove that the resulting limit filter is normal and $\omega_1$--complete. This yields closure of hereditarily symmetric names under countable tuples and, consequently, preservation of ZF; in a ZFC ground model we also obtain DC in the resulting symmetric model. When the iteration template is first-order definable over a GBC ground with Global Choice and sufficient class-recursion, the same scheme extends to class-length iterations, with the final symmetric model obtained from class hereditarily symmetric names (rather than as a union of stage models).</description>

      <title>Uniform Local Tabularity in Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By contrast wih $\mathsf{S4}$, the analysis of local tabularity above $\mathsf{IPC}$ has provided a difficult challenge. This paper studies a strengthening of local tabularity -- \textit{uniform local tabularity} -- where one demands that all formulas be equivalent to formulas of a given implication depth. Algebraically, this amounts to considering Heyting algebras generated by finitely many iterations of the implication operation. It is shown that in contrast with locally finite Heyting algebras, $n$-uniformly locally finite Heyting algebras always form a variety, and an explicit axiomatization of the variety of $n$-uniform locally finite Heyting algebras for $n\leq 2$ is given. In connection with this analysis, it is shown that there exist locally tabular logics which are not uniformly locally tabular, answering a question of Shehtman -- an example of a pre-uniformly locally tabular logic is presented.</description>

      <title>Resource-Bounded Martin-L\"of Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis for Dependent Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend resource-bounded type theory to Martin-Lof type theory (MLTT) with dependent types, enabling size-indexed cost bounds for programs over inductive families.
  We introduce a resource-indexed universe hierarchy U_r where r is an element of L and tracks the cost of type formation, and a graded modality Box_r for feasibility certification. Our main results are: (1) a cost soundness theorem showing that synthesized bounds over-approximate operational costs, with bounds expressed as functions of size indices; (2) a semantic model in the presheaf topos over L, extended with dependent presheaves and a comprehension structure; (3) canonicity for the intensional fragment; and (4) initiality of the syntactic model. We demonstrate the framework with case studies including length-indexed vector operations with linear bounds and binary search with logarithmic bounds, both expressed in the type.
  This work bridges the gap between dependent type theory and quantitative resource analysis, enabling certified cost bounds for size-dependent algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces of ortholattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe digraphs with topology which give dual representations of ortholattices. This is done via so-called dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces of lattices. First, we improve the definition of Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces from an earlier paper to give a straight and natural generalisation of the total order disconnectedness of Priestley spaces. Then we define the dual space of a general ortholattice as the dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space of the lattice-reduct of the ortholattice equipped with a map representing the orthocomplement operation. We introduce an abstract ortho-Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space capturing the properties of the dual space of an ortholattice, and we present dual representation theorems between general ortholattices and the ortho-Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces. We illustrate our dual representations by examples.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, under some mild conditions on $\vec{q}$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Spectra and Computably Composite Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting a result of Bazhenov, Kalimullin, and Yamaleev, we show that if a Turing degree $\textbf{d}$ is the degree of categoricity of a computable structure $\mathcal{M}$ and is not the strong degree of categoricity of any computable structure, then $\mathcal{M}$ has a pair of computable copies whose isomorphism spectrum is not finitely generated. Motivated by this result, we introduce a class of computable structures called computably composite structures with the property that the isomorphisms between arbitrary computable copies of these structures are exactly the unions of isomorphisms between the computable copies of their components. We use this to show that any computable union of isomorphism spectra is also an isomorphism spectrum. In particular, this gives examples of isomorphism spectra that are not finitely generated.</description>

      <title>A formalization of Borel determinacy in Lean</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalization of Borel determinacy in the Lean 4 theorem prover. The formalization includes a definition of Gale-Stewart games and a proof of Martin's theorem stating that Borel games are determined. The proof closely follows Martin's "A purely inductive proof of Borel determinacy".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of equivalence of generics filters started by Smythe in [Smy22]. We fully characterize those forcing posets for which the corresponding equivalence of generics is smooth using the purely topological property of condensation. Next we leverage our characterization to show that there are non-homogeneous forcing for which equivalence of generics is not smooth. Then we prove hyperfiniteness in the case of Prikry forcing and some additional results addressing the problem whether generic equivalence for Cohen forcing is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On the abstract elementary class of acts with embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of acts with embeddings as an abstract elementary class. We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both.</description>

      <title>G\"odel-Dummett and $\mathsf{BD_2}$: Linearity and Depth-Two Branching in Kripke Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semantic relationship between G\"odel-Dummett logic $\mathsf{GL}$ and bounded-depth-2 logic $\mathsf{BD_2}$, two well-known intermediate logics. While $\mathsf{GL}$ imposes linearity on Kripke frames, $\mathsf{BD_2}$ bounds their depth to two. We prove these logics are incomparable (neither contains the other) through minimal frame conditions. Notably, their combination $\mathsf{GL+BD_2}$ collapses to the logic of one or two world frames, bringing it remarkably close to classical logic. This illustrates how controlling breadth and depth in intuitionistic semantics leads to mutually exclusive structural constraints. Finally, we give a conceptual and philosophical interpretation of the previous results.

      <title>On universal-homogeneous hyperbolic graphs and spaces and their isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Urysohn space is the unique separable metric space that is universal and homogeneous for finite metric spaces, i.e., it embeds any finite metric space any isometry between finite subspaces extends to an isometry of the whole space. We here consider the existence of a universal-homogeneous hyperbolic space. We show that for $\delta&gt;0$ there is no $\delta$-hyperbolic space which is universal and homogeneous in the above sense for all finite $\delta$-hpyerbolic spaces.
  We then show that for any $\delta\geq 0$ and any countable class $\mathcal{C}$ of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with countably many distinguished $\delta$-closed subspaces there exists a $\delta$-hyperbolic metric space $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ such that every $X\in \mathcal{C}$ can be embedded into $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ as a $\delta$-closed subspace and any isometry between distinguished $\delta$-closed subspaces extends to an isometry of $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$.
  If $\mathcal{C}$ consists of $\delta$-hyperbolic geodesic spaces, then $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ contains the quasi-tree of spaces as defined by Bestvina et al..
  For $\mathcal{C}_\delta$ the class of all finite $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with rational distances or the class of finite $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs, the limit $\mathbb{H}_\delta$ is a $\delta$-hyperbolic space (or graph, respectively) universal for all finite $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with rational distances (or finite $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs) and such that any isometry between $\delta$-closed subspaces extends to an isometry of $\mathbb{H}_\delta$.
  We show that the isometry group of $\mathbb{H}_\delta$ does not contain elements of bounded displacement and has no dense conjugacy class.</description>

Abstract: We prove a perfectoid analogue of the Ax-Kochen theorem on zeros of $p$-adic forms: Given $d\in \mathbb{N}$, there is a finite totally ramified extension $E/\mathbb{Q}_p$ such that every untilt of $\mathbb{F}_p(\!(t^{1/p^{\infty}})\!)$ containing $E$ is $C_2(d)$. We also prove a similar result for the existence of rational points in rationally connected varieties over perfectoid field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p^{ur}$.</description>
