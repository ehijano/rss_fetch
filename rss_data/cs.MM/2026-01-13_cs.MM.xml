      <title>SmartSplat: Feature-Smart Gaussians for Scalable Compression of Ultra-High-Resolution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.</description>

      <title>Two-step Authentication: Multi-biometric System Using Voice and Facial Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a cost-effective two-step authentication system that integrates face identification and speaker verification using only a camera and microphone available on common devices. The pipeline first performs face recognition to identify a candidate user from a small enrolled group, then performs voice recognition only against the matched identity to reduce computation and improve robustness. For face recognition, a pruned VGG-16 based classifier is trained on an augmented dataset of 924 images from five subjects, with faces localized by MTCNN; it achieves 95.1% accuracy. For voice recognition, a CNN speaker-verification model trained on LibriSpeech (train-other-360) attains 98.9% accuracy and 3.456% EER on test-clean. Source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/NCUE-EE-AIAL/Two-step-Authentication-Multi-biometric-System.</description>

      <title>R$^3$D: Regional-guided Residual Radar Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar enables robust environment perception in autonomous systems under adverse conditions yet suffers from sparse, noisy point clouds with low angular resolution. Existing diffusion-based radar enhancement methods either incur high learning complexity by modeling full LiDAR distributions or fail to prioritize critical structures due to uniform regional processing. To address these issues, we propose R3D, a regional-guided residual radar diffusion framework that integrates residual diffusion modeling-focusing on the concentrated LiDAR-radar residual encoding complementary high-frequency details to reduce learning difficulty-and sigma-adaptive regional guidance-leveraging radar-specific signal properties to generate attention maps and applying lightweight guidance only in low-noise stages to avoid gradient imbalance while refining key regions. Extensive experiments on the ColoRadar dataset demonstrate that R3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a practical solution for radar perception enhancement. Our anonymous code and pretrained models are released here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/r3d-F836</description>

      <title>QMAVIS: Long Video-Audio Understanding using Fusion of Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for video-audio understanding have traditionally been evaluated only on shorter videos of a few minutes long. In this paper, we introduce QMAVIS (Q Team-Multimodal Audio Video Intelligent Sensemaking), a novel long video-audio understanding pipeline built through a late fusion of LMMs, Large Language Models, and speech recognition models. QMAVIS addresses the gap in long-form video analytics, particularly for longer videos of a few minutes to beyond an hour long, opening up new potential applications in sensemaking, video content analysis, embodied AI, etc. Quantitative experiments using QMAVIS demonstrated a 38.75% improvement over state-of-the-art video-audio LMMs like VideoLlaMA2 and InternVL2 on the VideoMME (with subtitles) dataset, which comprises long videos with audio information. Evaluations on other challenging video understanding datasets like PerceptionTest and EgoSchema saw up to 2% improvement, indicating competitive performance. Qualitative experiments also showed that QMAVIS is able to extract the nuances of different scenes in a long video audio content while understanding the overarching narrative. Ablation studies were also conducted to ascertain the impact of each component in the fusion pipeline.</description>

      <title>qAttCNN - Self Attention Mechanism for Video QoE Prediction in Encrypted Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.</description>

      <title>Cap2Sum: Learning to Summarize Videos by Generating Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data on the internet, video summarization is becoming a very important AI technology. However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</description>

      <title>Mesquite MoCap: Democratizing Real-Time Motion Capture with Affordable, Bodyworn IoT Sensors and WebXR SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion capture remains costly and complex to deploy, limiting use outside specialized laboratories. We present Mesquite, an open-source, low-cost inertial motion-capture system that combines a body-worn network of 15 IMU sensor nodes with a hip-worn Android smartphone for position tracking. A low-power wireless link streams quaternion orientations to a central USB dongle and a browser-based application for real-time visualization and recording. Built on modern web technologies -- WebGL for rendering, WebXR for SLAM, WebSerial and WebSockets for device and network I/O, and Progressive Web Apps for packaging -- the system runs cross-platform entirely in the browser. In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments. By leveraging IoT principles, edge processing, and a web-native stack, Mesquite lowers the barrier to motion capture for applications in entertainment, biomechanics, healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. We release hardware designs, firmware, and software under an open-source license (GNU GPL).</description>

      <title>Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and operations across the joint force.</description>

      <title>Time-RA: Towards Time Series Reasoning for Anomaly Diagnosis with LLM Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has traditionally focused on binary classification and often lacks the fine-grained categorization and explanatory reasoning required for transparent decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA), a novel task that reformulates TSAD from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive paradigm. To facilitate this, we introduce RATs40K, the first real-world large-scale multimodal benchmark with ~40,000 samples across 10 domains, integrating raw time series, textual context, and visual plots with structured reasoning annotations. Extensive benchmarking shows that while supervised fine-tuning and visual representations boost diagnostic accuracy and reasoning consistency, performance varies across complex scenarios. Notably, fine-tuned models demonstrate strong "plug-and-play" transferability, outperforming traditional baselines on unseen real-world datasets. Our work establishes a foundation for interpretable, multimodal time series analysis. All code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and the RATs40K dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) are fully open-sourced to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalizable and Efficient Image Watermarking via Hierarchical Two-Stage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enabling imperceptible watermark embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has been shown to be effective for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for generalizable watermarking: (1) invisibility (imperceptible hiding of watermarks), (2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and (3) broad applicability (low latency in the watermarking process). To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL) framework, a two-stage optimization that enables a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve all three criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to establish a common latent space with two constraints: (1) visual consistency between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and (2) information invariance across watermark latent representations. In this way, multimodal inputs -- including watermark messages (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) -- can be effectively represented, ensuring both the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in the watermarking process. In the second stage, we employ generalized watermark representation learning to separate a unique representation of the watermark from the marked image in RGB space. Once trained, the HiWL model effectively learns generalizable watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, it achieves 7.6% higher accuracy in watermark extraction compared to existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (processing 1000 images in 1 second).</description>

      <title>Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Omni2Sound: Towards Unified Video-Text-to-Audio Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a unified model integrating video-to-audio (V2A), text-to-audio (T2A), and joint video-text-to-audio (VT2A) generation offers significant application flexibility, yet faces two unexplored foundational challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality audio captions with tight A-V-T alignment, leading to severe semantic conflict between multimodal conditions, and (2) cross-task and intra-task competition, manifesting as an adverse V2A-T2A performance trade-off and modality bias in the VT2A task. First, to address data scarcity, we introduce SoundAtlas, a large-scale dataset (470k pairs) that significantly outperforms existing benchmarks and even human experts in quality. Powered by a novel agentic pipeline, it integrates Vision-to-Language Compression to mitigate visual bias of MLLMs, a Junior-Senior Agent Handoff for a 5 times cost reduction, and rigorous Post-hoc Filtering to ensure fidelity. Consequently, SoundAtlas delivers semantically rich and temporally detailed captions with tight V-A-T alignment. Second, we propose Omni2Sound, a unified VT2A diffusion model supporting flexible input modalities. To resolve the inherent cross-task and intra-task competition, we design a three-stage multi-task progressive training schedule that converts cross-task competition into joint optimization and mitigates modality bias in the VT2A task, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and off-screen audio generation faithfulness. Finally, we construct VGGSound-Omni, a comprehensive benchmark for unified evaluation, including challenging off-screen tracks. With a standard DiT backbone, Omni2Sound achieves unified SOTA performance across all three tasks within a single model, demonstrating strong generalization across benchmarks with heterogeneous input conditions.

Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</description>
