      <title>When LLMs Can't Help: Real-World Evaluation of LLMs in Nutrition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\ \href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}</description>

      <title>Domain-Grounded Evaluation of LLMs in International Student Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer high-stakes study-abroad questions about admissions, visas, scholarships, and eligibility. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').
  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.
  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.
  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.
  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.</description>

      <title>CodeVaani: A Multilingual, Voice-Based Code Learning Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming education often assumes English proficiency and text-based interaction, creating barriers for students from multilingual regions such as India. We present CodeVaani, a multilingual speech-driven assistant for understanding code, built into Bodhitree [1], a Learning Management System developed at IIT Bombay. It is a voice-enabled assistant that helps learners explore programming concepts in their native languages. The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively. Compared to classroom assistance, our framework offers ondemand availability, scalability to support many learners, and multilingual support that lowers the entry barrier for students with limited English proficiency. The demo will illustrate these capabilities and highlight how voice-based AI systems can make programming education more inclusive. Supplementary artifacts and demo video are also made available.</description>

      <title>Exploropleth: exploratory analysis of data binning methods in choropleth maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When creating choropleth maps, mapmakers often bin (i.e., group, classify) quantitative data values into groups to help show that certain areas fall within a similar range of values. For instance, a mapmaker may divide counties into groups of high, middle, and low life expectancy (measured in years). It is well known that different binning methods (e.g., natural breaks, quantile) yield different groupings, meaning the same data can be presented differently depending on how it is divided into bins. To help guide a wide variety of users, we present a new, open source, web-based, geospatial visualization tool, Exploropleth, that lets users interact with a catalog of established data binning methods, and subsequently compare, customize, and export custom maps. This tool advances the state of the art by providing multiple binning methods in one view and supporting administrative unit reclassification on-the-fly. We interviewed 16 cartographers and geographic information systems (GIS) experts from 13 government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and federal agencies who identified opportunities to integrate Exploropleth into their existing mapmaking workflow, and found that the tool has potential to educate students as well as mapmakers with varying levels of experience. Exploropleth is open-source and publicly available at https://exploropleth.github.io.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Visual Prompting: Automating Geospatial Web Dashboards with Large Language Models and Agent Self-Validation for Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of web-based geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support is often challenged by the difficulty in visualization of big, multi-dimensional environmental data, implementation complexity, and limited automation. We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation. This integrative approach is guided by structured knowledge and visual prompts, providing an innovative geospatial solution in enhancing risk analysis and decision making.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Agents with Emotional Intelligence: Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of agents with emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital due to their significant role in human-computer interaction and the growing integration of computer systems across various sectors of society. Affective computing aims to design intelligent systems that can recognize, evoke, and express human emotions, thereby emulating human emotional intelligence. While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Additionally, it addresses the synthesis of emotional expression across text, speech, and facial modalities to enhance human-agent interaction. This paper identifies and analyzes the key challenges and issues encountered in the development of affective systems, covering state-of-the-art methodologies designed to address them. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, with particular emphasis on the potential of generative technologies to advance affective computing.</description>

      <title>Iteration and Co-design of a Physical Web Application for Outdoor Activities with Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research and physical activity guidelines highlight the benefits of outdoor physical activities for ageing populations. There is potential for technology to facilitate outdoor activity through Physical Web infrastructure. We proposed that embedding Physical Web applications that are engaging and interactive in public open spaces as part of interactive wellness parks can encourage older adults to participate in physical activities outdoors and motivate rehabilitation. We have created an initial design prototype based on design requirements generated from a qualitative field study with 24 older adults to explore their perceptions, experiences, and routines of outdoor physical activities. In this paper, we present an initial prototype and findings from a co-design session with 12 older adults, eliciting their feedback on the design and their ideas for future design iterations.</description>

      <title>Transforming Higher Education with AI-Powered Video Lectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into video lecture production has the potential to transform higher education by streamlining content creation and enhancing accessibility. This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Legal Lens: A Sociotechnical Taxonomy of Lived Privacy Incidents and Harms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand how privacy incidents lead to harms, HCI researchers have historically leveraged legal frameworks. However, these frameworks expect acute, tangible harms and thus may not cover the full range of human experience relevant to modern-day digital privacy. To address this gap, our research builds upon these existing frameworks to develop a more comprehensive representation of people's lived experiences with privacy harms. We analyzed 369 privacy incidents reported by individuals from the general public. We found a broader range of privacy incidents and harms than accounted for in existing legal frameworks. The majority of reported privacy harms were not based on tangible harm, but on fear and loss of psychological safety. We also characterize the actors, motives, and information associated with various incidents. This work contributes a new framework for understanding digital privacy harms that can be utilized both in research and practice.</description>

      <title>PileUp: A Tufting Approach to Soft, Tactile, and Volumetric E-Textile Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PileUp, a tufted pile e-textile sensing approach that offers unique affordances through the tactile expressiveness and richness of its continuous, threaded-volume construction. By integrating conductive yarns in looped or cut pile forms, PileUp transforms soft 3-dimensional textiles into multimodal sensors capable of detecting mechanical deformations such as pressure, bending, and strain, as well as environmental conditions like moisture. We propose a design space that outlines the relationships between texture, form factor, and sensing affordances of tufted textiles. We characterize electrical responses under compression, bending, and strain, reporting sensor behaviors. To demonstrate versatility, we present three application scenarios in which PileUp sensors are seamlessly integrated into soft fabrics: a meditation rug with multi-zone sensing, a fleece sleeve that detects arm motion, and a moisture-sensing wall art. Our results establish tufting as an accessible yet expressive fabrication method for creating integrated sensing textiles, distinguishing our work from traditional flat textile sensors.</description>

      <title>LOOM: Personalized Learning Informed by Daily LLM Conversations Toward Long-Term Mastery via a Dynamic Learner Memory Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly used to personalize learning, yet many systems still assume fixed curricula or coarse progress signals, limiting alignment with learners' day-to-day needs. At the other extreme, lightweight incidental systems offer flexible, in-the-moment content but rarely guide learners toward mastery. Prior work privileges either continuity (maintaining a plan across sessions) or initiative (reacting to the moment), not both, leaving learners to navigate the trade-off between recency and trajectory-immediate relevance versus cumulative, goal-aligned progress. We present LOOM, an agentic pipeline that infers evolving learner needs from recent LLM conversations and a dynamic learner memory graph, then assembles coherent learning materials personalized to the learner's current needs, priorities, and understanding. These materials link adjacent concepts and surface gaps as tightly scoped modules that cumulatively advance broader goals, providing guidance and sustained progress while remaining responsive to new interests. We describe LOOM's end-to-end architecture and working prototype, including conversation summarization, topic planning, course generation, and graph-based progress tracking. In a formative study with ten participants, users reported that LOOM's generated lessons felt relevant to their recent activities and helped them recognize knowledge gaps, though they also highlighted needs for greater consistency and control. We conclude with design implications for more robust, mixed-initiative learning pipelines that integrate structured learner modelling with everyday LLM interactions.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Artificial Social Intelligence (HC-ASI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into human social contexts, Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) has emerged as a critical capability that enables AI to perceive, understand, and engage meaningfully in complex human social interactions. This chapter introduces a comprehensive framework for Human-Centered Artificial Social Intelligence (HC-ASI), built upon the Technology-Human Factors-Ethics (THE) Triangle, which systematically addresses both technical foundations and human-centered design principles necessary for developing socially intelligent AI systems. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of current ASI research. This chapter begins by establishing the theoretical foundations of ASI, tracing its evolution from classical psychological theories of human social intelligence to contemporary computational models, then examines the mechanisms underlying human-AI social interaction with particular emphasis on establishing shared social understanding and appropriate role positioning. The chapter further explores ASI's practical implications for individuals and groups through comprehensive evaluation frameworks that combine technical benchmarks with human-centered experiential assessments, demonstrating real-world applications through detailed case studies spanning healthcare, companionship, education, and customer service domains. Building on the overview and the framework of HC -ASI, this chapter articulates core HC-ASI design principles and translates them into actionable methodologies and implementation guidelines that provide practical guidance for researchers and practitioners. This chapter concludes with a critical discussion of current challenges and promising directions for developing comprehensive HC-ASI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Lattice Menu: A Low-Error Gaze-Based Marking Menu Utilizing Target-Assisted Gaze Gestures on a Lattice of Visual Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Lattice Menu, a gaze-based marking menu utilizing a lattice of visual anchors that helps perform accurate gaze pointing for menu item selection. Users who know the location of the desired item can leverage target-assisted gaze gestures for multilevel item selection by looking at visual anchors over the gaze trajectories. Our evaluation showed that Lattice Menu exhibits a considerably low error rate (~1%) and a quick menu selection time (1.3-1.6 s) for expert usage across various menu structures (4 x 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 x 6) and sizes (8, 10 and 12{\deg}). In comparison with a traditional gaze-based marking menu that does not utilize visual targets, Lattice Menu showed remarkably (~5 times) fewer menu selection errors for expert usage. In a post-interview, all 12 subjects preferred Lattice Menu, and most subjects (8 out of 12) commented that the provisioning of visual targets facilitated more stable menu selections with reduced eye fatigue.</description>

      <title>STAR: Smartphone-analogous Typing in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, devising an efficient and easy-to-use text entry method for AR remains an open challenge. This research presents STAR, a smartphone-analogous AR text entry technique that leverages a user's familiarity with smartphone two-thumb typing. With STAR, a user performs thumb typing on a virtual QWERTY keyboard that is overlain on the skin of their hands. During an evaluation study of STAR, participants achieved a mean typing speed of 21.9 WPM (i.e., 56% of their smartphone typing speed), and a mean error rate of 0.3% after 30 minutes of practice. We further analyze the major factors implicated in the performance gap between STAR and smartphone typing, and discuss ways this gap could be narrowed.</description>

      <title>QuadStretcher: A Forearm-Worn Skin Stretch Display for Bare-Hand Interaction in AR/VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of bare-hand interaction has become increasingly prevalent in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) environments, propelled by advancements in hand tracking technology. However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users' hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket. We further discuss the design insights gained from qualitative user interviews, presenting key takeaways for future forearm-haptic systems aimed at advancing AR/VR bare-hand experiences.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Compensates for Age-Related Cognitive Decline in Decision Making: Preference-Aligned Recommendations Reduce Choice Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to age-related declines in memory, processing speed, working memory, and executive functions, older adults experience difficulties in decision making when situations require novel choices, probabilistic judgments, rapid responses, or extensive information search. This study examined whether using generative AI during decision making enhances choice satisfaction and reduces choice difficulty among older adults. A total of 130 participants (younger: 56; older: 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. To assess cognitive function, we also administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Results revealed that in the AI-nonuse condition, older adults with lower cognitive function reported higher choice difficulty and lower choice satisfaction. Under the AI-use condition, choice satisfaction did not change significantly, but perceived choice difficulty decreased significantly in both age groups. Moreover, AI use attenuated the associations observed among older adults between lower cognitive function and both greater difficulty and lower satisfaction. These findings indicate that preference-aligned option recommendations generated by AI can compensate for age-related constraints on information search, thereby reducing perceived choice difficulty without diminishing satisfaction.</description>

      <title>TALES: A Taxonomy and Analysis of Cultural Representations in LLM-generated Stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.</description>

      <title>Seeing Twice: How Side-by-Side T2I Comparison Changes Auditing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generative AI systems have gained popularity in diverse applications, their potential to produce harmful outputs limits their trustworthiness and utility. A small but growing line of research has explored tools and processes to better engage non-AI expert users in auditing generative AI systems. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of MIRAGE, a web-based tool exploring a "contrast-first" workflow that allows users to pick up to four different text-to-image (T2I) models, view their images side-by-side, and provide feedback on model performance on a single screen. In our user study with fifteen participants, we used four predefined models for consistency, with only a single model initially being shown. We found that most participants shifted from analyzing individual images to general model output patterns once the side-by-side step appeared with all four models; several participants coined persistent "model personalities" (e.g., cartoonish, saturated) that helped them form expectations about how each model would behave on future prompts. Bilingual participants also surfaced a language-fidelity gap, as English prompts produced more accurate images than Portuguese or Chinese, an issue often overlooked when dealing with a single model. These findings suggest that simple comparative interfaces can accelerate bias discovery and reshape how people think about generative models.</description>

      <title>MMA: A Momentum Mamba Architecture for Human Activity Recognition with Inertial Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors is essential for ubiquitous computing, mobile health, and ambient intelligence. Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Sound: Visualization and Abstraction in Audio Data Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In audio signal processing, the interpretation of complex information using visual representation enhances pattern recognition through its alignment with human perceptual systems. Software tools that carry hidden assumptions inherited from their historical contexts risk misalignment with modern workflows as design origins become obscured. We argue that creating tools that align with emergent needs improves analytical and creative outputs due to an increased affinity for using them. This paper explores the potentials associated with adding dimensionality and interactivity into visualization tools to facilitate complex workflows in audio information research using the Jellyfish Dynamite software.</description>

      <title>InvisibleBench: A Deployment Gate for Caregiving Relationship AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge. No clinical claims; this is a deployment-readiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>CHiQPM: Calibrated Hierarchical Interpretable Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving from research prototypes into clinical, assistive, and performance enhancement technologies. Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR) system is a versatile brain-robot interface that allows humans to control robots for daily tasks using their brain signals. This interface utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to translate human intentions regarding specific objects and desired actions directly into commands that robots can execute. We present NOIR 2.0, an enhanced version of NOIR. NOIR 2.0 includes faster and more accurate brain decoding algorithms, which reduce task completion time by 46%. NOIR 2.0 uses few-shot robot learning algorithms to adapt to individual users and predict their intentions. The new learning algorithms leverage foundation models for more sample-efficient learning and adaptation (15 demos vs. a single demo), significantly reducing overall human time by 65%.</description>

      <title>Bug Detective and Quality Coach: Developers' Mental Models of AI-Assisted IDE Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-assisted tools support developers in performing cognitively demanding tasks such as bug detection and code readability assessment. Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance. Trust, in both tasks, depends on the clarity of explanations, timing, and user control. A set of design principles for Human-Centered AI in IDEs has been distilled, aiming to balance disruption with support, conciseness with depth, and automation with human agency.</description>

      <title>Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</description>

      <title>Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\Delta R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($\kappa = 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.</description>

      <title>From Prediction to Foresight: The Role of AI in Designing Responsible Futures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding human-LLM interactions is emerging as a central priority in psychological research. Online experiments offer an efficient means to study human-LLM interactions, yet integrating LLMs into established survey platforms remains technically demanding, particularly when aiming for ecologically valid, real-time conversational experiences with strong experimental control. We introduce Simple Chat, an open-source, research-focused chat interface that streamlines LLM integration for platforms such as Qualtrics, oTree, and LimeSurvey, while presenting a unified participant experience across conditions. Simple Chat connects to both commercial providers and open-weights models, supports streaming responses to preserve conversational flow, and offers an administrative interface for fine-grained control of prompts and interface features. By reducing technical barriers, standardizing interfaces, and improving participant experience, Simple Chat helps advance the study of human-LLM interaction. In this article, we outline Simple Chat's key features, provide a step-by-step tutorial, and demonstrate its utility through two illustrative case studies.</description>
