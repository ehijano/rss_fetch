      <title>Raspberry Pi Pico as a Radio Transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss several surprisingly simple methods for transforming the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2) microcontroller into a radio transmitter, by using only cheap off the shelf electronic components, and open source software. While initially this transformation may look as a harmless curiosity, in some extreme cases it can also pose security risks, since it can be used to open a large number of local stealth radio communication channels.</description>

      <title>A Federated Fine-Tuning Paradigm of Foundation Models in Heterogenous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability. Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in test accuracy and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth of Gamma-Distribution-Shaped Functions via Lambert W Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is a useful quantity for characterizing the bandwidth of unimodal functions. However, a closed-form expression for the FWHM of gamma-shaped functions-i.e. functions that are shaped like the gamma distribution probability density function (PDF)-is not widely available. Here, we derive and present just such an expression. To do so, we use the Lambert W function to compute the inverse of the gamma PDF. We use this inverse to derive an exact analytic expression for the width of a gamma distribution at an arbitrary proportion of the maximum, from which the FWHM follows trivially. (An expression for the octave bandwidth of gamma-shaped functions is also provided.) The FWHM is then compared to the Gaussian approximation of gamma-shaped functions. A few other related issues are discussed.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Spatio-temporal Attention and Multi-Scale Fusion for Clinically Interpretable, High-Fidelity Fetal ECG Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly, highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet, fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art models, achieving R2&gt;0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise. Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of next-generation biomedical signal processing.</description>

      <title>A Novel Two-Dimensional Wigner Distribution Framework via the Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform with a Non-Separable Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel time-frequency distribution, referred to as the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Wigner Distribution (2D-NSQPWD), formulated within the framework of the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (2D-NSQPFT). By replacing the classical Fourier kernel with the NSQPFT kernel, the proposed distribution generalizes the classical Wigner distribution and effectively captures complex, non-separable signal structures. We rigorously establish several key properties of the 2D-NSQPWD, including time and frequency shift invariance, marginal behavior, conjugate symmetry, convolution relations, and Moyal's identity. Furthermore, the connection between the 2D-NSQPWD and the two-dimensional short-time Fourier transform (2D-STFT) is explored. The distribution's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to single-, bi-, and tri-component two-dimensional linear frequency modulated (2D-LFM) signals, where it shows superior performance in cross-term suppression and signal localization.</description>

      <title>E2E Learning Massive MIMO for Multimodal Semantic Non-Orthogonal Transmission and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.</description>

      <title>STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM: An Effective Wave Height High Accuracy Prediction Model Fusing Time-Frequency Domain Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness. The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height. Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047 spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.</description>

      <title>Advancing Few-Shot Pediatric Arrhythmia Classification with a Novel Contrastive Loss and Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Identification from Behind Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.</description>

      <title>Scensory: Automated Real-Time Fungal Identification and Spatial Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor fungal contamination poses significant risks to public health, yet existing detection methods are slow, costly, and lack spatial resolution. Conventional approaches rely on laboratory analysis or high-concentration sampling, making them unsuitable for real-time monitoring and scalable deployment. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Scensory}}, a robot-enabled olfactory system that simultaneously identifies fungal species and localizes their spatial origin using affordable volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor arrays and deep learning. Our key idea is that temporal VOC dynamics encode both chemical and spatial signatures, which we decode through neural architectures trained on robot-automated data collection. We demonstrate two operational modes: a passive multi-array configuration for environmental monitoring, and a mobile single-array configuration for active source tracking. Across five fungal species, our system achieves up to 89.85\% accuracy in species detection and 87.31\% accuracy in localization under ambient conditions, where each prediction only takes 3--7\,s sensor inputs. Additionally, by computationally analyzing model behavior, we can uncover key biochemical signatures without additional laboratory experiments. Our approach enables real-time, spatially aware fungal monitoring and establishes a scalable and affordable framework for autonomous environmental sensing.</description>

      <title>Human Activity Recognition Based on Electrocardiogram Data Only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored, these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition without additional motion sensors.</description>

      <title>LibEMER: A novel benchmark and algorithms library for EEG-based Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2025ULUIUBUEUMUEUR485384</description>

      <title>Holographic Transformers for Complex-Valued Signal Processing: Integrating Phase Interference into Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/EonHao/Holographic-Transformers.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion EEG Virtual Channel Signal Generation Network and Its Application in Anxiety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.</description>

      <title>CSIYOLO: An Intelligent CSI-based Scatter Sensing Framework for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ISAC is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems, enabling simultaneous data transmission and target sensing. Among various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes, leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components: anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization. First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters. Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations, enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Estimation and Computation Offloading in Fluid Antenna-assisted MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA) based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>A Measurement Report Data-Driven Framework for Localized Statistical Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Sensor Fusion Framework for Organic Substance Classification and Quality Control Using Classification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup, resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Regional Electricity Demand Forecasting in Argentina Using LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Based Framework for Passive Intermodulation Cancellation in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reconstruction of Significant Wave Heights from Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Mixture-of-Experts Framework for EMG Artifact Removal in EEG: Empirical Insights and a Proof-of-Concept Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality. While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Pipeline SWD Detection in Long-Term EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term, monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392 annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening in extended EEG recordings.</description>

      <title>Self-Alignment Learning to Improve Myocardial Infarction Detection from Single-Lead ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.</description>

      <title>SpellerSSL: Self-Supervised Learning with P300 Aggregation for Speller BCIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation via Dual-Stage Alignment and Self-Supervision for Fast-Calibration Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Insights into Xona Pulsar LEO PNT: Constellation, Signals, and Receiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is expanding with the emergence of low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations such as Pulsar, which are expected to play a key role in the future of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). LEO-based systems provide advantages including stronger signals for greater robustness, faster dynamics that aid convergence and multipath mitigation, and shorter time to first fix (TTFF) enabled by high data rates. These benefits, however, come with changes in signal behavior and constellation geometry that require careful consideration in receiver design. This paper investigates Pulsar properties using a GNSS simulator, analyzing parameters such as satellite pass duration, elevation, Doppler shift, Doppler rate, range, and number of satellites in view. Comparisons with GPS highlight the differences introduced by LEO operation. The analysis examines temporal evolution, statistical distributions, and maximum and minimum values. Beyond these statistical insights, the study explores interdependencies between parameters and differences across satellites, providing additional perspective. Evaluations are performed at multiple latitudes to ensure a worldwide perspective, and the impact of applying different elevation masks is discussed where relevant. Building on these findings, the paper assesses Pulsar's impact on receiver design from two standpoints: design considerations, addressing expanded Doppler ranges, higher Doppler rates, and unique constellation structure; and design optimizations, exploiting parameter analyses and interdependencies (e.g., Doppler rate vs Doppler) to refine acquisition strategies and applying prediction and prioritization techniques to avoid unnecessary computations. Together, these optimizations can reduce acquisition time and lower receiver power consumption.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Nulling Control Beam Focusing for Near-Field Multi-User Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for near-field nulling control beam focusing (NCBF) in extra-large MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate multi-user interference (MUI). A dual-estimator architecture comprising two fully connected deep neural networks (FCDNNs) is developed to separately predict the phase and magnitude components of NCBF weights, using locations of both desired and interfering users. The models are trained on a large dataset generated via a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming algorithm to accommodate diverse user configurations, including both collinear and non-collinear scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed DNN models achieve high prediction accuracy, with test errors of only 0.067 radians for phase estimation and 0.206 dB for magnitude estimation. Full-wave simulations incorporating realistic element radiation patterns and inter-element coupling confirm the close agreement between the beam patterns produced by the DNN-predicted and LCMV-based NCBF schemes under practical deployment conditions. An average MUI suppression of 36.7 dB is achieved, with interference mitigation exceeding 17.5 dB across all tested cases. The proposed approach enables scalable and real-time beam focusing with effective interference suppression, offering a promising solution for future near-field multi-user wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Non-locally averaged pruned reassigned spectrograms: a tool for glottal pulse visualization and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reassigned spectrograms have shown advantages in precise formant measuring and inter-speaker differentiation. However, reassigned spectrograms suffer from their inability to visualize larger amounts of data in an easily comprehensible and reproducible manner. Utilizing the techniques and tools developed by Fulop and Fitz, a variation of the reassigned spectrogram is proposed. Non-locally Averaged Pruned Reassigned Spectrograms (NAPReS) provide a simplified view into the characteristics of a speaker's glottal pulsation patterns throughout the centroid of a vowel through the stacking, summing, and pruning of large numbers of glottal pulses. In this exploratory study, NAPReS has been shown to display a large amount of data in an easily comprehensible and quantifiable manner, while also making the observation of low-amplitude cyclical structures more accessible. NAPReS also allows for alternative formant fitting methods such as Gaussian mixture modeling. In this study, NAPReS with GMM was compared against conventional LPC fitting of formant values and was shown to be more reproducible than conventional LPC fitting in high-noise situations.</description>

      <title>Timeliness-Aware Joint Source and Channel Coding for Adaptive Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely image transmission is critical for emerging time-sensitive applications such as remote sensing in satellite-assisted Internet of Things. However, the bandwidth limitation poses a significant challenge in existing wireless systems, making it difficult to fulfill the requirements of both high-fidelity and low-latency image transmission. Semantic communication is expected to break through the performance bottleneck by focusing on the transmission of goal-oriented semantic information rather than raw data. In this paper, we employ a new timeliness metric named the value of information (VoI) and propose an adaptive joint source and channel coding (JSCC) method for image transmission that simultaneously considers both reconstruction quality and timeliness. Specifically, we first design a JSCC framework for image transmission with adaptive code length. Next, we formulate a VoI maximization problem by optimizing the transmission code length of the adaptive JSCC under the reconstruction quality constraint. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of reconstruction quality and timeliness, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, offering a promising solution for efficient and robust image transmission in time-sensitive wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetics-Compliant Optimization of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Bistatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) are recently attracting considerable research interests due to their potential to enable low-cost, reconfigurable, and highly scalable antenna array architectures for next generation wireless systems. However, most of the existing literature relies on idealized models for the DMA operation, often overlooking critical structural and physical constraints inherent to their constituent metamaterials. In this paper, leveraging a recently proposed model for this antenna architecture incorporating physically consistent modeling of mutual coupling and waveguide propagation losses, we optimize DMA-based transmission for bistatic sensing. A tractable approximation for the DMA response is first presented, which enables efficient optimization of the dynamically reconfigurable Lorentzian-constrained responses of the array's metamaterials. In particular, we formulate a robust beamforming optimization problem with the objective to minimize the worst-case position error bound, in the presence of spatial uncertainties for the environment's scatterers as well as synchronization uncertainties at the analog combining multi-antenna receiver. To address the resulting high computational complexity due to the possibly excessive number of metamaterial-based antennas and their operation constraints, two low complexity beamforming design approaches are presented that perform offline searching over a novel beam codebook. The accuracy of all presented DMA designs is assessed by means of Monte Carlo simulations for various system parameters, confirming that accurately modeling mutual coupling is essential for maintaining increased localization performance. It is also shown that, even under positioning and synchronization uncertainties, the proposed designs yield accuracy comparable to their fully digital and analog counterparts, while adhering to the structural DMA constraints.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nonnegative Structured Kruskal Tensor Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Generalized Nonnegative Structured Kruskal Tensor Regression (NS-KTR), a novel tensor regression framework that enhances interpretability and performance through mode-specific hybrid regularization and nonnegativity constraints. Our approach accommodates both linear and logistic regression formulations for diverse response variables while addressing the structural heterogeneity inherent in multidimensional tensor data. We integrate fused LASSO, total variation, and ridge regularizers, each tailored to specific tensor modes, and develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm for parameter estimation. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic signals and real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that NS-KTR consistently outperforms conventional tensor regression methods. The framework's ability to preserve distinct structural characteristics across tensor dimensions while ensuring physical interpretability makes it especially suitable for applications in signal processing and hyperspectral image analysis.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Spectrum Sharing: Joint Antenna Orientation and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional antenna arrays rely primarily on digital beamforming for spatial control. While adding more elements can narrow beamwidth and suppress interference, such scaling incurs prohibitive hardware and power costs. Rotatable antennas (RAs), which allow mechanical or electronic adjustment of element orientations, introduce a new degree of freedom to exploit spatial flexibility without enlarging the array. By dynamically optimizing orientations, RAs can substantially improve desired link alignment and interference suppression. This paper investigates RA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channels under co-channel spectrum sharing and formulates a weighted sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this nonconvex problem, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) framework that integrates weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based beamforming with Frank-Wolfe-based orientation updates. To reduce complexity, we further study orientation optimization under maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. For finite-resolution actuators, we construct spherical Fibonacci codebooks and design a cross-entropy method (CEM)-based algorithm for discrete orientation selection. Simulations show that integrating RAs with conventional beamforming markedly increases weighted sum-rate, with gains rising with element directivity. Under discrete orientation control, the proposed CEM algorithm consistently outperforms the nearest-projection baseline.</description>

      <title>On the Invariance of Cross-Correlation Peak Positions Under Monotonic Signal Transformations, with Application to Fast Time Difference Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theorem concerning the invariance of cross-correlation peak positions, which provides a foundation for a new method for time difference estimation that is potentially faster than the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach for real/complex sequences. This theoretical result shows that the peak position of the cross-correlation function between two shifted discrete-time signals remains unchanged under arbitrary monotonic transformations of the input signals. By exploiting this property, we design an efficient estimation algorithm based on the cross-correlation function between signals quantized into low-bit integers. The proposed method requires only integer arithmetic instead of real-valued operations, and further computational efficiency can be achieved through number-theoretic algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a shorter processing time than conventional FFT-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Near-field Spatial-domain Channel Extrapolation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are pivotal to next-generation wireless communications, where dynamic RF chain architectures offer enhanced performance. However, efficient precoding in such systems requires accurate channel state information (CSI) obtained with low complexity. To address this challenge, spatial-domain channel extrapolation has attracted growing interest. Existing methods often overlook near-field spherical wavefronts or rely heavily on sparsity priors, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive near-field channel extrapolation framework for multi-subcarrier XL-MIMO systems, leveraging a strategically selected subset of antennas. Subsequently, we develop both on-grid and off-grid algorithms, where the latter refines the former's estimates for improved accuracy. To further reduce complexity, a cross-validation (CV)-based scheme is introduced. Additionally, we analytically formulate the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix and propose a coherence-minimizing-based random pattern to ensure robust extrapolation. Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing methods in both extrapolation accuracy and achievable rate, while maintaining low computational complexity. In particular, our proposed CV ratio offers a flexible trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and the corresponding off-grid algorithm achieves high accuracy with complexity comparable to conventional on-grid methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage CD-Kennedy Receiver for QPSK Modulated CV-QKD in Turbulent Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols attract increasing attentions in recent years because they enjoy high secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical communication infrastructure. Classical coherent receivers are widely employed in coherent states based CV-QKD protocols, whose detection performance is bounded by the standard quantum limit (SQL). Recently, quantum receivers based on displacement operators are experimentally demonstrated with detection performance outperforming the SQL in various practical conditions. However, potential applications of quantum receivers in CV-QKD protocols under turbulent channels are still not well explored, while practical CV-QKD protocols must survive from the atmospheric turbulence in satellite-to-ground optical communication links. In this paper, we consider the possibility of using a quantum receiver called multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the SKR performance of a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated CV-QKD protocol in turbulent channels. We first derive the error probability of the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver for detecting QPSK signals in turbulent channels and further propose three types of multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver with different displacement choices, i.e., the Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III receivers. Then we derive the SKR of a QPSK modulated CV-QKD protocol using the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver and post-selection strategy in turbulent channels. Numerical results show that the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver can outperform the classical coherent receiver in turbulent channels in terms of both error probability and SKR performance and the Type-II receiver can tolerate worse channel conditions compared with Type-I and Type-III receivers in terms of error probability performance.</description>

      <title>Reproduction Number and Spatial Connectivity Structure Estimation via Graph Sparsity-Promoting Penalized Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.</description>

      <title>A dual bistatic optical forward transceiver configuration for determining the position of an acoustic communication source detected by optical communication fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fibers have long been employed as sensors in a wide range of commercial systems. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) extends this concept by enabling the detection and localization of acoustic sources along the fiber, using backscattered light from small segments to achieve spatial resolution on the order of meters. Recently, DAS has also been explored as a component in underwater acoustic communication systems. Emerging interest in bidirectional configurations where both transmitter and receiver are placed at opposite ends of the fiber has opened new possibilities. However, in such setups, source localization is not inherently integrated into the signal decoding process. For scenarios where source positioning is valuable, we propose an approach inspired by bi-static radar principles. This configuration utilizes acoustic signals received at both ends of the fiber to estimate source position based on propagation delay differences. Although the localization accuracy is lower than that of DAS due to reduced sampling rates, the method offers a viable alternative for integrated communication and positioning. We present the system topology and configuration for a dual-fiber layout, each end equipped with optical transmitters and receivers. The position estimation is derived from the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the two receivers. The Cram\'er-Rao Bound is derived to characterize the theoretical limits of localization accuracy, highlighting dependencies on system parameters such as optical power loss. Our analysis shows that increased acoustic bandwidth and higher carrier frequencies enhance spatial resolution. We formulate the Cross Ambiguity Function as a maximum likelihood estimator for TDOA and provide simulation results illustrating its performance under varying system conditions. Finally, we discuss key challenges that must be addressed for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Joint Ex-Post Location Calibration and Radio Map Construction under Biased Positioning Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a high-accuracy radio map construction method tailored for environments where location information is affected by bursty errors. Radio maps are an effective tool for visualizing wireless environments. Although extensive research has been conducted on accurate radio map construction, most existing approaches assume noise-free location information during sensing. In practice, however, positioning errors ranging from a few to several tens of meters can arise due to device-based positioning systems (e.g., GNSS). Ignoring such errors during inference can lead to significant degradation in radio map accuracy. This study highlights that these errors often tend to be biased when using mobile devices as sensors. We introduce a novel framework that models these errors together with spatial correlation in radio propagation by embedding them as tunable parameters in the marginal log-likelihood function. This enables ex-post calibration of location uncertainty during radio map construction. Numerical results based on practical human mobility data demonstrate that the proposed method can limit RMSE degradation to approximately 0.25-0.29 dB, compared with Gaussian process regression using noise-free location data, whereas baseline methods suffer performance losses exceeding 1 dB.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-RIS): Scattering Matrix Design via Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.</description>

      <title>Geometric Port Selection in CUMA Systems</title>

Abstract: Compact ultra-massive antenna-array (CUMA) is a novel multiple access technology built on the fluid antenna system (FAS) concept, offering an improved scheme over fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) that can support massive connectivity on the same physical channel without the need of precoding and interference cancellation. By employing a simple port-selection mechanism that leverages random channel superposition, CUMA can suppress inter-user interference while keeping hardware costs low. Nevertheless, its ad-hoc port-selection strategy leaves considerable room for optimization. In this work, we revisit CUMA and propose two adaptive single-RF port-selection schemes that retain its simplicity while significantly enhancing performance. The first one, referred to as exact optimal half-space (EOHS), dynamically selects the projection direction that maximizes the instantaneous signal build-up across active ports. To reduce complexity while preserving most of the gains, we furthermore introduce a principal component analysis (PCA)-based scheme, which aligns port partitioning with the dominant statistical direction of per-port channel vectors. This method yields a closed-form low-complexity solution, complemented by a tractable analytical framework that provides a closed-form expression for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) probability density function (PDF). Simulation results corroborate the analysis, demonstrating that both EOHS and PCA consistently outperform conventional CUMA across diverse user densities, port counts, and FAS aperture sizes. Notably, PCA achieves performance close to EOHS at a fraction of the computational cost. The proposed schemes scale effectively to large-user regimes, offering a compelling complexity-performance trade-off for next-generation multiple access systems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Fourier Diffuser: Frequency-Aware Diffusion Model for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>PPGFlowECG: Latent Rectified Flow with Cross-Modal Encoding for PPG-Guided ECG Generation and Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis. Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world cardiovascular screening.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regularization by Smooth Non-separable Non-convex Penalty Function Based on Ultra-discretization Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sparse optimization, the $\ell_{1}$ norm is widely adopted for its convexity, yet it often yields solutions with smaller magnitudes than expected. To mitigate this drawback, various non-convex sparse penalties have been proposed. Some employ non-separability, with ordered weighting as an effective example, to retain large components while suppressing small ones. Motivated by these approaches, we propose ULPENS, a non-convex, non-separable sparsity-inducing penalty function that enables control over the suppression of elements. Derived from the ultra-discretization formula, ULPENS can continuously interpolate between the $\ell_{1}$ norm and a non-convex selective suppressing function by adjusting parameters inherent to the formula. With the formula, ULPENS is smooth, allowing the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. We establish key theoretical properties of ULPENS and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning: A Noise-Robust Encoder for Biosignal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing from Classical Coherent Systems to Continuous-Variable QKD: A Review of Cross-Domain Techniques, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms, such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient CV-QKD systems.</description>

      <title>To Fold or Not to Fold: Graph Regularized Tensor Train for Visual Data Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor train (TT) representation has achieved tremendous success in visual data completion tasks, especially when it is combined with tensor folding. However, folding an image or video tensor breaks the original data structure, leading to local information loss as nearby pixels may be assigned into different dimensions and become far away from each other. In this paper, to fully preserve the local information of the original visual data, we explore not folding the data tensor, and at the same time adopt graph information to regularize local similarity between nearby entries. To overcome the high computational complexity introduced by the graph-based regularization in the TT completion problem, we propose to break the original problem into multiple sub-problems with respect to each TT core fiber, instead of each TT core as in traditional methods. Furthermore, to avoid heavy parameter tuning, a sparsity promoting probabilistic model is built based on the generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) prior, and an inference algorithm is derived under the mean-field approximation. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world visual data show the superiority of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</description>

Abstract: Satellite networks (SN) have long provided two fundamental services: global communications and Earth-oriented sensing, supporting applications from connectivity and navigation to disaster management and environmental monitoring. Yet, the accelerating demand for data and the emergence of new applications render the independent evolution of communication and sensing payloads increasingly unsustainable. Joint communications and sensing (JCAS) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, integrating both functions within a unified payload to enhance spectral efficiency, reduce operational costs, and minimize hardware redundancy. Beyond efficiency, this integration creates opportunities for novel services that are infeasible under separate payload designs. This paper motivates the role of JCAS in shaping the sixth-generation (6G) of satellite networks, explores a representative use case to assess its feasibility, and discusses key challenges that must be addressed to unlock its full potential. By highlighting these opportunities inherent to the space environment, we aim to stimulate the development of JCAS as a cornerstone technology for the next-generation space era</description>

      <title>High-Availability Integrity Monitoring for Multi-Constellation GNSS Navigation with Non-Gaussian Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation, requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than 50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings, baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for multi-constellation GNSS applications.</description>

Abstract: A broadly applicable method for secret-key generation is named for its accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) properties. This paper first shows a robustness of its performance. Namely, even if there is an inter correlation or a leakage caused intra correlation among the superimposed packets, provided there is a nonzero probability for each packet to be missed in full or in part by Eve, then the equivocation of the key generated by the AAA method always becomes perfect as the number of superpositions becomes infinite. Also shown in this paper is a comparison between the AAA method and an ideal method based on reciprocal channel estimation, which reveals several advantages of the AAA method.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Equalization of Zak-OTFS in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4G/5G wireless standards use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which is robust to frequency selectivity. Equalization is possible with a single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive physical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since Doppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers and they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly selective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a superposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel introduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to equalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler axes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing Zak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show that it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the channel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate gradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that complexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame. For comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame dimension. Through numerical simulations we show that FD equalization of Zak-OTFS achieves similar performance as equalization in DD domain.</description>

A major problem for UAV RC links is that interference sources within the coverage may degrade the link quality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV than the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line of sight (LoS) with a larger number of interference sources. As a result, lost hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) feedback in the uplink (UL, RC to UAV) may degrade the downlink (DL, UAV to RC) throughput. To get physical evidence for our interference asymmetry argument, we first conducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform at the Main Campus area of NC State University during the 2024 Packapalooza festival. Subsequently, we evaluated the throughput impact of the loss of HARQ indicator feedback caused by UL asymmetry using MATLAB long-term-evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G) toolboxes. Our numerical results confirm that UL interference asymmetry substantially degrades the throughput performance due to the loss of HARQ indicator feedback.</description>

      <title>Meta Fluid Antenna: Architecture Design, Performance Analysis, Experimental Examination</title>

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense connectivity. These systems utilize dynamic radiating and/or shaping techniques to mitigate interference and improve spectral efficiency without relying on channel state information (CSI). The reported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated radiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To fully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose leveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency (RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation. This allows for a significantly larger set of independent radiating states without requiring additional signal processing. Simulations demonstrate that multi-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments compared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR can be optimized within a 15~$\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user Rayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for fast-changing wireless environments. Verified through the theoretical Jakes' model, full three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) simulations and experimental validation, multi-activation FAMA enables effective CSI-free, multi-user communication, offering a scalable solution for high-capacity wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Survey of Deep Learning and Physics-Based Approaches in Computational Wave Imaging</title>

Abstract: Computational wave imaging (CWI) extracts hidden structure and physical properties of a volume of material by analyzing wave signals that traverse that volume. Applications include seismic exploration of the Earth's subsurface, acoustic imaging and non-destructive testing in material science, and ultrasound computed tomography in medicine. Current approaches for solving CWI problems can be divided into two categories: those rooted in traditional physics, and those based on deep learning. Physics-based methods stand out for their ability to provide high-resolution and quantitatively accurate estimates of acoustic properties within the medium. However, they can be computationally intensive and are susceptible to ill-posedness and nonconvexity typical of CWI problems. Machine learning-based computational methods have recently emerged, offering a different perspective to address these challenges. Diverse scientific communities have independently pursued the integration of deep learning in CWI. This review discusses how contemporary scientific machine-learning (ML) techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, have been developed to enhance and integrate with traditional physics-based methods for solving CWI problems.
  We present a structured framework that consolidates existing research spanning multiple domains, including computational imaging, wave physics, and data science. This study concludes with important lessons learned from existing ML-based methods and identifies technical hurdles and emerging trends through a systematic analysis of the extensive literature on this topic.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>
