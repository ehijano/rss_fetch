      <title>SciCom Wiki: Fact-Checking and FAIR Knowledge Distribution for Scientific Videos and Podcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Democratic societies need accessible, reliable information. Videos and Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI) curating non-textual media is still fragmented and not adequately equipped to scale against the content flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) media representation and the fact-checking of their content, particularly for videos and podcasts. Building an open-source service system centered around Wikibase, we survey requirements from 53 stakeholders, refine these in 11 interviews, and evaluate our prototype based on these requirements with another 14 participants. To address the most requested feature, fact-checking, we developed a neurosymbolic computational fact-checking approach, converting heterogenous media into knowledge graphs. This increases machine-readability and allows comparing statements against equally represented ground-truth. Our computational fact-checking tool was iteratively evaluated through 10 expert interviews, a public user survey with 43 participants verified the necessity and usability of our tool. Overall, our findings identified several needs to systematically support the SciCom KI. The SciCom Wiki, as a FAIR digital library complementing our neurosymbolic computational fact-checking framework, was found suitable to address the raised requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge node, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale against the imminent (mis-)information flood.</description>

      <title>How are research data referenced? The use case of the research data repository RADAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Publishing research data aims to improve the transparency of research results and facilitate the reuse of datasets. In both cases, referencing the datasets that were used is recommended. Research data repositories can support data referencing through various measures and also benefit from it, for example using this information to demonstrate their impact. However, the literature shows that the practice of formally citing research data is not widespread, data metrics are not yet established, and effective incentive structures are lacking. This article examines how often and in what form datasets published via the research data repository RADAR are referenced. For this purpose, the data sources Google Scholar, DataCite Event Data and the Data Citation Corpus were analyzed. The analysis shows that 27.9 % of the datasets in the repository were referenced at least once. 21.4 % of these references were (also) present in the reference lists and are therefore considered data citations. Datasets were referenced often in data availability statements. A comparison of the three data sources showed that there was little overlap in the coverage of references. In most cases (75.8 %), data and referencing objects were published in the same year. Two definition approaches were considered to investigate data reuse. 118 RADAR datasets were referenced more than once. Only 21 references had no overlaps in the authorship information -- these datasets were referenced by researchers that were not involved in data collection.</description>

      <title>From raw affiliations to organization identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate affiliation matching, which links affiliation strings to standardized organization identifiers, is critical for improving research metadata quality, facilitating comprehensive bibliometric analyses, and supporting data interoperability across scholarly knowledge bases. Existing approaches fail to handle the complexity of affiliation strings that often include mentions of multiple organizations or extraneous information. In this paper, we present AffRo, a novel approach designed to address these challenges, leveraging advanced parsing and disambiguation techniques. We also introduce AffRoDB, an expert-curated dataset to systematically evaluate affiliation matching algorithms, ensuring robust benchmarking. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of AffRp in accurately identifying organizations from complex affiliation strings.</description>
