      <title>Applications of Combinatorics on Words with Symbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore applications of combinatorics on words across various domains, including data compression, error detection, cryptographic protocols, and pseudorandom number generation. The examination of the theoretical foundations enabling these applications, emphasizing important concepts of mathematical relationships and algorithms. In data compression, we discuss the Lempel-Ziv family of algorithms and Lyndon factorization, with the number of Lyndon words of length \( n \) over an alphabet of size \( k \) given by \[ L(n,k) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) k^{n/d}. \] We address cryptographic protocols and pseudorandom number generation, highlighting the role of pseudorandomness theory and complexity measures. Also, by explore de Bruijn sequences, topological entropy, and synchronizing words in their practical contexts, demonstrating their contributions to optimizing information storage, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>On Domination Exponents for Pairs of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding graph density profiles is notoriously challenging. Even for pairs of graphs, complete characterizations are known only in very limited cases, such as edges versus cliques. This paper explores a relaxation of the graph density profile problem by examining the homomorphism density domination exponent $C(H_1, H_2)$. This is the smallest real number $c \geq 0$ such that $t(H_1, T) \geq t(H_2, T)^c$ for all target graphs $T$ (if such a $c$ exists) where $t(H,T)$ is the homomorphism density from $H$ to $T$. We demonstrate that infinitely many families of graphs are required to realize $C(H_1, H_2)$ for all connected graphs $H_1$, $H_2$. We derive the homomorphism density domination exponent for a variety of graph pairs, including paths and cycles. As a couple of typical examples, we obtain exact values when $H_1$ is an even cycle and $H_2$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and provide asymptotically sharp bounds when both $H_1$ and $H_2$ are odd cycles.</description>

      <title>Approximate polymorphisms of predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Finding a long cycle in a percolated vertex expander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the percolated graph $G_p$ has each edge independently retained with probability $p$. Collares, Diskin, Erde, and Krivelevich initiated the study of large structures in percolated single-scale vertex expanders, wherein every set of exactly $k$ vertices of $G$ has at least $dk$ neighbours before percolation. We extend their result to a conjectured stronger form, proving that if $p = (1+\varepsilon)/d$ and $G$ expands as above, then $G_p$ fails to contain a cycle of length $\Omega_\varepsilon(kd)$ with exponentially small probability.</description>

      <title>Lexicographic products and lexicographic powers of graphs -- a walk matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic polynomial and the spectrum of the lexicographic product of graphs $H[G]$, a specific instance of the generalized composition (also called $H$-join), are explicitly determined for arbitrary graphs $H$ and $G$, in terms of the eigenvalues of $G$ and an $H[G]$ associated matrix $\widetilde{{\bf W}}$, which relates $H$ with $G$. This study also establishes conditions under which a main eigenvalue of $G$ is a main or non-main eigenvalue of the matrix $\widetilde{{\bf W}}$, when the nullity of the graph $H$ is $\eta&gt;0$. In such a case, we prove that every main eigenvalue of $G$ is an eigenvalue of $\widetilde{{\bf W}}$ with multiplicity at least $\eta$ which is non-main for $\bf \widetilde{W}$ if and only if $0$ is a non-main eigenvalue of $H$. Furthermore, the spectra of the lexicographic powers of arbitrary graphs $G$ are analysed by applying the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Oriented hypergraphs and generalizing the Harary-Sachs theorem to integer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incidence-based generalizations of cycle covers, called contributors, extend the Harary-Sachs coefficient theorem for characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrix of graphs. All minors of the Laplacian resulting from an integer matrix are characterized using their associated oriented hypergraph through a new minimal collection of contributors to produce the coefficients of the total-minor polynomial. We prove that the natural grouping of contributors via tail-equivalence is necessarily cancellative for any contributor family that reuses an edge. We then provide a new combinatorial proof on the non-0 isospectrality of the traditional characteristic polynomials of the Laplacian and its dual.</description>

      <title>On kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs and finite $2$PCI-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isomorphism problem for digraphs is a fundamental problem in graph theory. In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In our previous paper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\geq 2$, and finite $m$PCI-groups for each $m\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite $m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass of the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much effort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying finite BCI-groups is still widely open.
  In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its Sylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow $p$-subgroup with $p\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to $Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of isomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs together with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of finite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite non-abelian BCI-groups.</description>

      <title>Layered tree-independence number and clique-based separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Galby, Munaro, and Yang (SoCG 2023) asking whether every graph class of bounded layered tree-independence number admits clique-based separators of sublinear weight, we investigate relations between layered tree-independence number, weight of clique-based separators, clique cover degeneracy and independence degeneracy. In particular, we provide a number of results bounding these parameters on geometric intersection graphs. For example, we show that the layered tree-independence number is $\mathcal{O}(g)$ for $g$-map graphs, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{r}{\tanh r})$ for hyperbolic uniform disk graphs with radius $r$, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for spherical uniform disk graphs with radius $r$. Our structural results have algorithmic consequences. In particular, we obtain a number of subexponential or quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for weighted problems such as \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} and \textsc{Min Weight Feedback Vertex Set} on several geometric intersection graphs. Finally, we conjecture that every fractionally tree-independence-number-fragile graph class has bounded independence degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: We study Nurikabe puzzles on non-orientable surfaces. Specifically, we propose two versions of non-orientable Nurikabe and investigate their combinatorics on M\"obius strips, Klein bottles, and projective planes of size $1\times n$. Our results establish new connections among the OEIS sequences A101946, A213387, A123203, and A001045 (the Jacobsthal sequence).</description>

      <title>On the structure of perfectly divisible graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. A graph $G$ is minimally non-perfectly divisible if $G$ is not perfectly divisible but each of its proper induced subgraph is. A set $C$ of vertices of $G$ is a clique cutset if $C$ induces a clique in $G$, and $G-C$ is disconnected. We prove that a $P_5$-free minimally non-perfectly divisible graph cannot contain a clique cutset. This result allows us to re-establish several theorems on the perfect divisibility of some classes of $P_5$-free graphs. We will show that recognizing perfectly divisible graphs is NP-hard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973, Chv\'atal conjectured that there exists a constant $t_0$ such that every $t_0$-tough graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. While this conjecture is still open, work has been done to confirm it for several graph classes, including all $F$-free graphs for every 5-vertex linear forest $F$ other than $P_5$ and $2P_2\cup P_1$. In this note, we show that 11-tough $(2P_2 \cup P_1)$-free graphs on at least three vertices are Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Orthogonally Convex Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first undecidability result on the tiling is the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with Wang tiles, where there is an additional color matching requirement. Later, researchers obtained several undecidability results on translational tiling problems where the tilings are subject to the geometric shapes of the tiles only. However, all these results are proved by constructing tiles with extremely concave shapes. It is natural to ask: can we obtain undecidability results of translational tiling with convex tiles? Towards answering this question, we prove the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with a set of 7 orthogonally convex polyominoes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of vertices is called a dissociation set if it induces a subgraph with vertex degree at most one. Recently, Yuan et al. established the upper bound of the maximum number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs of order n and characterized the corresponding extremal graphs.They also proposed a question regarding the second-largest number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs of order n and the corresponding extremal graphs. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question.</description>

      <title>On the Vertices of Delta-modular Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a polytope defined by the system $A x \leq b$, where $A \in R^{m \times n}$, $b \in R^m$, and $\text{rank}(A) = n$. We give a short geometric proof of the following tight upper bound on the number of vertices of $P$: $$
  n! \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}} \cdot \text{vol}(B_2) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}} \cdot \left(\frac{2 \pi}{e}\right)^{n/2} \cdot n^{n/2} \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}, $$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $n \times n$ subdeterminants of $A$, and $\Delta_{\text{average}}$ is the average absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to a triangulation of $P$'s normal fan. Assuming that $A$ is integer, such polyhedra are called $\Delta$-modular polyhedra. Note that in the integer case, the bound can be simplified via the inequality $\Delta_{\text{average}} \geq \Delta_{\min} \geq 1$, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the minimum absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to feasible bases of $A x \leq b$. For this, we prove and use a symmetric variant of Macbeath's theorem.
  Additionally, we give a direct argument based on prior results in the field, showing that the graph diameter of $P$ is bounded by $O\bigl(n^3 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}} \cdot \ln (n \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}}) \bigr)$. Thus, both characteristic of $P$ are linear in $\Delta/\Delta_{\min}$.
  From an algorithmic perspective, we demonstrate that:
  Given $A \in Q^{m \times n}$, $b \in Q^m$, and an initial feasible solution to $A x \leq b$, the convex hull of $P$ can be constructed in $O(n)^{n/2} \cdot m^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ operations. For simple polyhedra, the dependence on $m$ reduces to linear;
  Given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, the number $|P \cap Z^n|$ can be computed in $O(n)^n \cdot \frac{\Delta^4}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Powers of 2 in High-Dimensional Lattice Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W_d(n)$ be the number of $2n$-step walks in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ which begin and end at the origin. We study the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorisation of this number; i.e., $w_d(n) = \nu_2(W_d(n))$. We show that, for each $d$, there is a relationship between $w_d(n)$ and the number $s_2(n)$ of $1$s in the binary expansion of $n$. For example, $w_d(n) = s_2(n)$ if $d$ is odd and $w_d(n) = 2s_2(n)$ if $\nu_2(d) = 1$; while $w_d(n) \ge 3s_2(n)$ if $\nu_2(d) = 2$. The pattern changes further when $\nu_2(d) \ge 3$. However, for each $d$, we give the best analogous estimate of $w_d(n)$ together with a description of all $n$ where equality is attained. The methods we develop apply to a wider range of problems as well, and so might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Peak algebra in noncommuting variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{QSym}}$ for the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, $\mathrm{QSym}$, and the peak algebra $\Pi$ were originally defined by Stembridge in 1997. We define the labelled descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{NCQSym}}$ and extend the notion of the peak algebra to noncommuting variables. Moreover, we define Schur $Q$-functions in noncommuting variables having properties analogous to the classical Schur $Q$-functions.</description>

      <title>Locating-dominating partitions for some classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $D \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. A set $L\subseteq V(G)$ is a locating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V(G) \setminus L$ has pairwise distinct open neighborhoods in $L$. A set $D\subseteq V(G)$ is a locating-dominating set of $G$ if $D$ is a dominating set and a locating set of $G$. The location-domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{LD}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality among all locating-dominating sets of $G$. A well-known conjecture in the study of locating-dominating sets is that if $G$ is an isolate-free and twin-free graph of order $n$, then $\gamma_{LD}(G)\le \frac{n}{2}$. Recently, Bousquet et al. [Discrete Math. 348 (2025), 114297] proved that if $G$ is an isolate-free and twin-free graph of order $n$, then $\gamma_{LD}(G)\le \lceil\frac{5n}{8}\rceil$ and posed the question whether the vertex set of such a graph can be partitioned into two locating sets. We answer this question affirmatively for twin-free distance-hereditary graphs, maximal outerplanar graphs, split graphs, and co-bipartite graphs. In fact, we prove a stronger result that for any graph $G$ without isolated vertices and twin vertices, if $G$ is a distance-hereditary graph or a maximal outerplanar graph or a split graph or a co-bipartite graph, then the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into two locating-dominating sets. Consequently, this also confirms the original conjecture for these graph classes.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Constructive Heuristic for Large-Scale Survivable Traffic Grooming Problem under Double-Link Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a survivable traffic grooming problem in large-scale optical transport networks under double-link failures (STG2). Each communication demand must be assigned a route for every possible scenario involving zero, one, or two failed fiber links. Protection against double-link failures is crucial for ensuring reliable telecommunications services while minimizing equipment costs, making it essential for telecommunications companies today. However, this significantly complicates the problem and is rarely addressed in existing studies. Furthermore, current research typically examines networks with fewer than 300 nodes, much smaller than some emerging networks containing thousands of nodes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical constructive heuristic for STG2. This heuristic constructs and assigns routes to communication demands across different scenarios by following a hierarchical sequence. It incorporates several innovative optimization techniques and utilizes parallel computing to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments have been conducted on large-scale STG2 instances provided by our industry partner, encompassing networks with 1,000 to 2,600 nodes. Results demonstrate that within a one-hour time limit and a 16 GB memory limit set by the industry partner, our heuristic improves the objective values of the best-known solutions by 18.5\% on average, highlighting its significant potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Ricci Curvature of Strong Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the explicit curvature formulas for the horizontal and vertical edges of the strong product of two regular graphs. We complement this result with showing that there does not exist a nice formula for the curvatures of diagonal edges, except for a special case in terms of curvatures of the factors. This gives the curvature formulas for all edges of the product of a complete graph and a regular graph. We also present an accessible and simpler proof of the curvature formulas for all the edges of the Cartesian product of two regular graphs, originally established by Lin, Lu, and Yau [2011].</description>

Abstract: We say that a finite factor $f$ of a word $w$ is \emph{imaged} if there exists a non-erasing morphism $m$, distinct from the identity, such that $w$ contains $m(f)$. We show that every infinite binary word contains an imaged factor of length at least 6 and that 6 is best possible. We show that every infinite binary word contains at least 36 distinct imaged factors and that 36 is best possible.</description>

      <title>Meeting a Challenge raised by Ekhad and Zeilberger related to Stern's Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves an open problem raised by Ekhad and Zeilberger for computing $\omega(10000)$, which is related to Stern's triangle. While $\nu(n)$, defined as the sum of squared coefficients in $\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (1 + x^{2^i} + x^{2^{i+1}})$, admits a rational generating function, the analogous function $\omega(n)$ for $\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (1 + x^{2^i+1} + x^{2^{i+1}+1})$ presents substantial computational difficulties due to its complex structure.
  We develop a method integrating constant term techniques, conditional transfer matrices, algebraic generating functions, and $P$-recursions. Using the conditional transfer matrix method, we represent $\omega(n)$ as the constant term of a bivariate rational function. This framework enables the calculation of $\omega(10000)$, a $6591$-digit number, and illustrates the method's broad applicability to combinatorial generating functions.</description>

      <title>Covering radii of $3$-zonotopes and the shifted Lonely Runner Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the shifted Lonely Runner Conjecture (sLRC) holds for 5 runners. We also determine that there are exactly 3 primitive tight instances of the conjecture, only two of which are tight for the non-shifted conjecture (LRC). Our proof is computational, relying on a rephrasing of the sLRC in terms of covering radii of certain zonotopes (Henze and Malikiosis, 2017), and on an upper bound for the (integer) velocities to be checked (Malikiosis, Santos and Schymura, 2024+).
  As a tool for the proof, we devise an algorithm for bounding the covering radius of rational lattice polytopes, based on constructing dyadic fundamental domains.</description>

      <title>No-dimensional Tverberg-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Adiprasito et al. have initiated the study of the so-called no-dimensional Tverberg problem. This problem can be informally stated as follows: Given $n\geq k$, partition an $n$-point set in Euclidean space into $k$ parts such that their convex hulls intersect a ball of relatively small radius.
  In this survey, we aim to present the recent progress towards solving the no-dimensional Tverberg problem and new open questions arising in its context. Also, we discuss the colorful variation of this problem and its algorithmic aspects, particularly focusing on the case when each part of a partition contains exactly 2 points. The latter turns out to be related to the following no-dimensional Tverberg-type problem of Huemer et al.: For an even set of points in Euclidean space, find a perfect matching such that the balls with diameters induced by its edges intersect.</description>

      <title>Standard posets and integral weight bases for symmetric powers of minuscule representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our earlier work where we constructed ``minuscule'' representations of Kac--Moody algebras from colored posets in a way that maintains key properties of the well-known minuscule representations of simple Lie algebras. In this paper we work only with finite posets. We define standard posets here as ones that can be used to construct weight bases of $m^\text{th}$ symmetric powers ($m \ge 1$) of these minuscule Kac--Moody representations over the integers in a certain fashion. Our main result is to show that our ``$\Gamma$-colored $d$-complete'' and ``$\Gamma$-colored minuscule'' posets are standard. When the algebra at hand is a simply laced simple Lie algebra and the representation minuscule in the classic sense (i.e. isomorphic to irreducible $V(\lambda)$ for minuscule highest weight $\lambda$), our result produces a concrete combinatorially described weight basis for the irreducible representation $V(m\lambda)$ that is indexed in a natural fashion by $m$-multichains in the weight lattice for $V(\lambda)$. C.S. Seshadri first showed such an indexing of a basis is possible. Our work here is entirely combinatorial and does not use results or techniques from algebraic geometry. Constructions in this paper are independent of Lie type and actions of Kac--Moody algebra elements on basis vectors are effectively specified.</description>

      <title>Largest dyadic dual VC-dimension of non-piercing families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dyadic dual VC-dimension of a set system \( \mathcal{F} \) is the largest integer \( \ell \) such that there exist \( \ell \) sets \( F_1, F_{2}, \dots, F_\ell \in \mathcal{F} \), where every pair \( \{i, j\} \in \binom{[\ell]}{2} \) is witnessed by an element \( a_{i,j} \in F_i \cap F_j \) that does not belong to any other set \( F_k \) with \( k \in [\ell] \setminus \{i, j\} \). In this paper, we determine the largest dyadic dual VC-dimension of a non-piercing family is exactly $4$, providing a rare example where the maximum of this parameter can be determined for a natural family arising from geometry. As an application, we give a short and direct proof that the transversal number \( \tau(\mathcal{F}) \) of any non-piercing family is at most \(C\nu(\mathcal{F})^9 \), where \( \nu(\mathcal{F}) \) is the matching number and $C$ is a constant. This improves a recent result of P\'{a}lv\"{o}lgyi and Z\'{o}lomy.</description>

      <title>Counting homomorphisms in antiferromagnetic graphs via Lorentzian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13659v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-weighted graph $G$, possibly with loops, is said to be antiferromagnetic if it has nonnegative weights and at most one positive eigenvalue, counting multiplicities. The number of graph homomorphisms from a graph $H$ to an antiferromagnetic graph $G$ generalises various important parameters in graph theory, including the number of independent sets and proper vertex-colourings, as well as their relaxations in statistical physics.
  We obtain homomorphism inequalities for various graphs $H$ and antiferromagnetic graphs~$G$ of the form \[ \lvert\operatorname{Hom}(H,G)\rvert^2 \leq \lvert\operatorname{Hom}(H\times K_2,G)\rvert, \] where $H\times K_2$ denotes the tensor product of $H$ and $K_2$. Firstly, we show that the inequality holds for any $H$ obtained by blowing up vertices of a bipartite graph into complete graphs and any antiferromagnetic $G$. In particular, one can take $H=K_{d+1}$, which already implies a new result for the Sah--Sawhney--Stoner--Zhao conjecture on the maximum number of $d$-regular graphs in antiferromagnetic graphs. Secondly, the inequality also holds for $G=K_q$ and those $H$ obtained by blowing up vertices of a bipartite graph into complete multipartite graphs, paths or even cycles.
  Both results can be seen as the first progress towards Zhao's conjecture on $q$-colourings, which states that the inequality holds for any $H$ and $G=K_q$, after his own work. Our method leverages on the emerging theory of Lorentzian polynomials due to Br\"and\'en and Huh and log-concavity of the list colourings of bipartite graphs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: The surface Tutte polynomial has recently been generalised to pseudo-surfaces equipping it with recursive deletion-contraction relations. We use these relations to show that this generalisation naturally possesses a quasi-tree expansion. This extends quasi-tree expansions of the Bollob\'as-Riordan, Las Vergnas and Krushkal polynomials, which we recover from our main result.</description>

      <title>An Introductory Survey of Recursions in the Computation of Resistance Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an introduction and expository account of a beautiful, current, and active application of recursions to the computation of resistance distance. Resistance distance, also referred to as effective resistance, is a well-known graph metric that arises naturally by considering a graph as an electrical circuit; heuristically resistance distance measures both the number of paths between two vertices in a graph and the cost of each path. This topic finds applications in a rich array of fields including social, biological, ecological, and transportation networks, chemistry, graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and engineering. A variety of methods are used in the field to determine resistance distance including recursive, mathematical, and graphical techniques. Sequences familiar to the readers of the Fibonacci Quarterly such as the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences appear quite often in results in the literature. Twenty five to forty years ago there were a handful of papers on resistance that appeared in the Fibonacci Quarterly and the Proceedings and recently papers on the subject have appeared again. It is hoped that this introductory expository account will interest readers of the Quarterly to renew interest in this current and active field.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Graphon Quantum Filtering Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on a class of dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system of equations, study its well-posedness, and establish a propagation of chaos result for multiple bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum graphon games and quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Circular Directional Flow Decomposition (CDFD), a new framework for analyzing circularity in weighted directed networks. CDFD separates flow into two components: a circular (divergence-free) component and an acyclic component that carries all nett directional flow. This yields a normalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks formed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring directionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles, and admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback, weighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although the decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all decompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable topological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark decompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity solution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF) solution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular flow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network structure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability of both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform existing circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The decomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the distribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require explicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and efficient transport.</description>

      <title>On the cross-correlation properties of large-size families of Costas arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Costas arrays have been an interesting combinatorial object for decades because of their optimal aperiodic auto-correlation properties. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find families of Costas arrays or extended arrays with small maximal cross-correlation values, since for applications in multi-user systems, the cross-interferences between different signals should also be small. The objective of this paper is to study several large-size families of Costas arrays or extended arrays, and their values of maximal cross-correlation are partially bounded for some cases of horizontal shifts $u$ and vertical shifts $v$. Given a prime $p \geq 5$, in particular, a large-size family of Costas arrays over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ is investigated, including both the exponential Welch Costas arrays and logarithmic Welch Costas arrays. An upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of this family for arbitrary $u$ and $v$ is given. We also show that the maximal cross-correlation of the family of power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for $u = 0$ and $v \neq 0$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{p-1}$. Furthermore, we give the first nontrivial upper bound of $(p-1)/t$ on the maximal cross-correlation of the larger family including both exponential Welch Costas arrays and power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for arbitrary $u$ and $v=0$, where $t$ is the smallest prime divisor of $(p-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reconstruction Codes with Given Reads in Multiple Burst-Substitutions Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal reconstruction codes over the multiple-burst substitution channel. Our main contribution is establishing a trade-off between the error-correction capability of the code, the number of reads used in the reconstruction process, and the decoding list size. We show that over a channel that introduces at most $t$ bursts, we can use a length-$n$ code capable of correcting $\epsilon$ errors, with $\Theta(n^\rho)$ reads, and decoding with a list of size $O(n^\lambda)$, where $t-1=\epsilon+\rho+\lambda$. In the process of proving this, we establish sharp asymptotic bounds on the size of error balls in the burst metric. More precisely, we prove a Johnson-type lower bound via Kahn's Theorem on large matchings in hypergraphs, and an upper bound via a novel variant of Kleitman's Theorem under the burst metric, which might be of independent interest.
  Beyond this main trade-off, we derive several related results using a variety of combinatorial techniques. In particular, along with tools from recent advances in discrete geometry, we improve the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the asymptotic regime for multiple bursts, and determine the minimum redundancy required for reconstruction codes with polynomially many reads. We also propose an efficient list-reconstruction algorithm that achieves the above guarantees, based on a majority-with-threshold decoding scheme.</description>

Abstract: We prove new cases of reasonable bounds for the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem both over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $N$ prime and over the integers. In particular, we prove reasonable bounds for Szemer\'edi's theorem in the integers with fixed polynomial common difference. That is, we prove for any polynomial $P(y)\in \mathbb{Z}[y]$ with $P(0) = 0$, that the largest subset $A\subseteq [N]$ avoiding the pattern \[x, x+P(y),\ldots, x+ kP(y)\] has size bounded by $\ll_{P,k}N(\log\log\log N)^{-\Omega_{P,k}(1)}.$</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Rank of Subsets: Metric Density in Finite Hamming Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of rank for subsets of finite metric spaces E^n_q (the set of all n-dimensional vectors over an alphabet of size q) equipped with the Hamming distance, where the rank R(A) of a subset A is defined as the number of non-constant columns in the matrix formed by the vectors of A. This purely combinatorial definition provides a new perspective on the structure of finite metric spaces, distinct from traditional linear-algebraic notions of rank. We establish tight bounds for R(A) in terms of D_A, the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of elements in A. Specifically, we prove that 2qD_A/((q-1)|A|^2) &lt;= R(A) &lt;= D_A/(|A|-1) when |A|/q &gt;= 1, with a modified lower bound for the case |A|/q &lt; 1. These bounds show that the rank is constrained by the metric properties of the subset. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of metrically dense subsets, which are subsets that minimize rank among all isometric images. This notion captures an extremal property of subsets that represent their distance structure in the most compact way possible. We prove that subsets with uniform column distribution are metrically dense, and as a special case, establish that when q is a prime power, every linear subspace of E^n_q is metrically dense. This reveals a fundamental connection between the algebraic and metric structures of these spaces.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Imsets for Cyclic Linear Causal Models and the Chickering Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two directed graphs are called covariance equivalent if they induce the same set of covariance matrices, up to a Lebesgue measure zero set, on the random variables of their associated linear structural equation models. For acyclic graphs, covariance equivalence is characterized both structurally, via essential graphs and characteristic imsets, and transformationally, through sequences of covered edge flips. However, when cycles are allowed, only a transformational characterization of covariance equivalence has been discovered. We consider a linear map whose fibers correspond to the sets of graphs with identical characteristic imset vectors, and study the toric ideal associated to its integer matrix. Using properties of this ideal we show that directed graphs with the same characteristic imset vectors are covariance equivalent. In applications, imsets form a smaller search space for solving causal discovery via greedy search.</description>

Abstract: Given an arbitrary abstract simplicial complex $K$ on $[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$, different from the simplex $\Delta_{[m]}$ with $m$ vertices, we introduce and study a canonical $(2m-2)$-dimensional toric manifold $X_K$, associated to the canonical $(m-1)$-dimensional complete regular fan $\Sigma_K$. This construction yields an infinite family of toric manifolds that are not quasitoric and provides a topological proof of the Dehn-Sommerville relations for the associated Bier sphere $\mathrm{Bier}(K)$. Finally, we prove a criterion for orientability of canonical real toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>

      <title>Brick-splitting Torsion Pairs and Trim Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is a trim lattice. We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</description>

This formula after some analytical issues can be reduce to the Erd\"os's Matching formula. Also we prove the conjecture about the cardinality of maximal $s$-wise $t$-intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$. In the proofs we use original method which we have already used in the proof of Mikl\'os-Manikam-Singhi conjecture in \cite{1}.

Abstract: A finite group is said to be $n$-cyclic if it contains $n$ cyclic subgroups. For a finite group $G$, the ratio of the number of cyclic subgroups to the number of subgroups is known as the cyclicity degree of the group $G$ and is denoted by $cdeg (G)$. In this paper, we classify all $12$-cyclic groups. We also prove that the set of cyclicity degrees for all the finite groups is dense in $[0,1]$, which gives a solution to the problem asked by T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu and T\'{o}th in [20] "For every $a\in [0, 1]$, does there exist a sequence $(G_n)$ of finite groups such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} cdeg(G_n)=a$ "?</description>

The formula, which expresses this number in terms of Euler totients of unitary divisors of $n$, is related to some recent variant of the RSA cryptosystem for regular integers modulo $n$, which is briefly outlined to underpin its significance.</description>

      <title>Connectoids I: a universal end space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series we introduce and investigate the concept of connectoids, which captures the connectivity structure of various discrete objects like undirected graphs, directed graphs, bidirected graphs, hypergraphs or finitary matroids.
  In this paper we develop a universal end space theory based on connectoids: the end spaces of connectoids unify the existing end spaces of undirected and directed graphs and establish end spaces for bidirected graphs, hypergraphs and finitary matroids.
  The main result shows that the tangle-like description of ends in undirected graphs, called directions, extends to connectoids: there is a one-to-one correspondence between the directions of a connectoid and its ends. Furthermore, we generalise normal trees of undirected graphs to connectoids and show that normal trees represent the ends of a connectoid as they do for undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Connectoids II: existence of normal trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series, we introduce and investigate the concept of connectoids, which captures the connectivity structure of various discrete objects such as undirected graphs, directed graphs, bidirected graphs, hypergraphs and finitary matroids. In the first paper, we developed a universal end space theory based on connectoids that unifies the existing end spaces of undirected and directed graphs. In this paper, we establish normal trees of connectoids as a natural generalisation of normal trees of undirected graphs, which are one of the most important tools in infinite graph theory. More precisely, we show that the existence of normal trees of connectoids can be characterised in the same way as for normal trees of undirected graphs: We extend Jung's famous characterisation via dispersed sets to connectoids, and prove that normal spanning trees exist if they exist in some neighbourhood of each end. Furthermore, we show that a connectoid has a normal spanning tree if and only if its groundset can be well-ordered in a certain way, called countable separation number.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sets in Triangle-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of vertices is $k$-sparse if it induces a graph with a maximum degree of at most $k$. In this missive, we consider the order of the largest $k$-sparse set in a triangle-free graph of fixed order. We show, for example, that every triangle-free graph of order 11 contains a 1-sparse 5-set; every triangle-free graph of order 13 contains a 2-sparse 7-set; and every triangle-free graph of order 8 contains a 3-sparse 6-set. Further, these are all best possible.
  For fixed $k$, we consider the growth rate of the largest $k$-sparse set of a triangle-free graph of order $n$. Also, we consider Ramsey numbers of the following type. Given $i$, what is the smallest $n$ having the property that all triangle-free graphs of order $n$ contain a 4-cycle or a $k$-sparse set of order $i$. We use both direct proof techniques and an efficient graph enumeration algorithm to obtain several values for defective Ramsey numbers and a parameter related to largest sparse sets in triangle-free graphs, along with their extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm can be found at https://codeberg.org/zsamboki/dbs-udg.</description>

      <title>Spanning spheres in Dirac hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices has a spanning subgraph homeomorphic to the $(k - 1)$-dimensional sphere provided that $H$ has no isolated vertices and each set of $k - 1$ vertices supported by an edge is contained in at least $n/2 + o(n)$ edges. This gives a topological extension of Dirac's theorem and asymptotically confirms a conjecture of Georgakopoulos, Haslegrave, Montgomery, and Narayanan.
  Unlike typical results in the area, our proof does not rely on the Absorption Method, the Regularity Lemma or the Blow-up Lemma. Instead, we use a recently introduced framework that is based on covering the vertex set of the host graph with a family of complete blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal roots, Macdonald representations, and quasiparabolic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a simply laced Weyl group of finite type and rank $n$. If $W$ has type $E_7$, $E_8$, or $D_n$ for $n$ even, then the root system of $W$ has subsystems of type $nA_1$. This gives rise to an irreducible Macdonald representation of $W$ spanned by $n$-roots, which are products of $n$ orthogonal roots in the symmetric algebra of the reflection representation. We prove that in these cases, the set of all maximal sets of orthogonal positive roots has the structure of a quasiparabolic set in the sense of Rains--Vazirani. The quasiparabolic structure can be described in terms of certain quadruples of orthogonal positive roots which we call crossings, nestings, and alignments. This leads to nonnesting and noncrossing bases for the Macdonald representation, as well as some highly structured partially ordered sets. We use the $8$-roots in type $E_8$ to give a concise description of a graph that is known to be non-isomorphic but quantum isomorphic to the orthogonality graph of the $E_8$ root system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate normal trees of directed graphs, which extend the fundamental concept of normal trees of undirected graphs. We prove that a directed graph $D$ has a normal spanning tree if and only if the topological space $|D|$ is metrizable, which generalises Diestel's result for undirected graphs. Furthermore, we show that the existence of normal arborescences implies the existence of normal trees in directed graphs, and that the converse is generally not true.</description>

Abstract: Halin showed that every thick end of every graph contains an infinite grid. We extend Halin's theorem to digraphs. More precisely, we show that for every infinite family $\mathcal{R}$ of disjoint equivalent out-rays there is a grid whose vertical rays are contained in $\mathcal{R}$. Furthermore, we obtain similar results for in-rays and necklaces.</description>

Abstract: We develop a search algorithm for systems of $q$-difference equations satisfied by Andrews-Gordon type double series. We then couple the search algorithm with Euler's algorithm for finding infinite products to narrow the search space. We exemplify some findings of the algorithm, along with their proofs. We also explain some of the double series in a base partition and moves framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every symmetric polynomial $h(x)$ with center of symmetry $n/2$ can be expressed as a linear combination in the basis $x^i(1+x)^{n-2i}$. The $\gamma$-polynomial of $h(x)$, which we denote $\gamma_h(x)$, records the coefficients of this linear combination. Two decades ago, Br\"and\'en and Gal independently showed that if $\gamma_h(x)$ has nonpositive real roots only, then so does $h(x)$. More recently, Br\"and\'en, Ferroni, and Jochemko proved using Lorentzian polynomials that if $\gamma_h(x)$ is ultra log-concave, then so is $h(x)$, and they raised the question of whether a similar statement can be proved for the usual notion of log-concavity. The purpose of this article is to show that the answer to the question of Br\"and\'en, Ferroni, and Jochemko is affirmative. One of the crucial ingredients of the proof is an inequality involving binomial numbers that we establish via a path-counting argument.</description>

Abstract: Merge-width, recently introduced by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, is a common generalisation of bounded expansion classes and twin-width for which the first-order model checking problem remains tractable. We prove that a number of basic properties shared by bounded expansion and bounded twin-width graphs also hold for bounded merge-width graphs: they are $\chi$-bounded, they satisfy the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property, and their neighbourhood complexity is linear.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-matchability in cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sch\"onberger (1934) showed that every 2-connected cubic graph is matching covered. For a vertex $v$ of a 2-connected cubic graph $G$, a $v$-matching is a spanning subgraph in which $v$ has degree three whereas every other vertex has degree one; we say that $v$ is $\lambda$-matchable if $G$ admits a $v$-matching, and we let $\lambda(G)$ denote the number of such vertices. Clearly, no vertex is $\lambda$-matchable in bipartite graphs; we instead consider $\lambda$-matchable pairs defined analogously; we let $\rho$ denote the number of such pairs.
  Chen, Lu and Zhang [Discrete Math., 2025] studied $\lambda$-matchability and showed constants lower bounds on $\lambda$ and $\rho$. We establish stronger lower bounds that feature matching-theoretic invariants that arise from the work of Lov\'asz.
  Lov\'asz [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1987] proved that every matching covered graph $G$ admits a `unique decomposition' into special ones called `braces' (bipartite) and `bricks' (nonbipartite); $b(G)$ denotes the number of its bricks, $\beta(G)$ denotes the sum of the orders of its bricks, $b'(G)$ denotes the number of its braces of order six or more, and $\beta'(G):=\sum \left(\frac{n(H)}{2}\right)^2$, wherein the sum is over all its braces $H$ of order six or more.
  We prove that 3-connected cubic graphs satisfy $\lambda \geq \beta$, and that the bipartite ones satisfy $\rho \geq \beta'+3b'-3 \geq 3n-9$. We use the fact that every 2-connected cubic graph admits a `unique decomposition' into 3-connected ones to extend our bounds. We show that the same bound $\lambda \geq \beta$ holds for all 2-connected cubic graphs, and we also characterize those that satisfy $\lambda=n$. Our generalized lower bounds on $\rho$, in the case of bipartite graphs, feature invariants that rely on the aforementioned decomposition. For each bound, we characterize all tight examples.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph $H$ of large treewidth such that either $H$ is a subdivided wall or the line graph of a subdivided wall, or every induced subgraph of $H$ admits a tree decomposition where each bag induces a subgraph of small domination number. This is best possible as subdivided walls and their line graphs do not admit such tree decompositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The switch chain is a well-studied Markov chain which generates random graphs with a given degree sequence and has uniform stationary distribution. Motivated by the high number of triangles seen in some real-world networks, we study a variant of the switch chain which is more likely to produce graphs with higher numbers of triangles. Specifically, we apply a Metropolis scheme designed to have the following stationary distribution: graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{\min\{t(G),\nu\}}$, where $t(G)$ is the number of triangles in $G$ and $\nu$ is a cut-off value introduced to moderate the impact of graphs with a very high number of triangles. We assume that the "activity" $\lambda$ satisfies $\lambda\geq 1$, and call the resulting chain the modified Metropolis switch chain. We prove that the modified Metropolis switch chain is rapidly mixing whenever the (standard) switch chain is rapidly mixing, provided that the activity and maximum degree are not too large.
  The triangle switch (or "$\triangle$-switch") chain is a restriction of the switch chain which only performs switches that change the set of triangles in the graph. We prove that the $\triangle$-switch chain is irreducible for any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 3, and prove a rapid mixing result for the modified Metropolis $\triangle$-switch chain.
  Finally, we investigate the distribution of triangles in random graphs with given degrees, under both the uniform distribution and the distribution in which graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{t(G)}$. Our analysis implies that the imposition of the cut-off $\nu$ does not significantly impact the behaviour of these modified Metropolis chains over polynomially many steps</description>

      <title>Forbidden complexes for the 3-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simplicial complex is said to be {\em critical} (or {\em forbidden}) for the 3-sphere $S^3$ if it cannot be embedded in $S^3$, but becomes embeddable upon removing the open star of any simplex in its second barycentric subdivision.
  We show that if a regular multibranched surface cannot be embedded in $S^3$, then it contains a critical complex consisting of a multibranched surface and, possibly, a graph. We classify all critical complexes for $S^3$ that are contained in the $K_5 \times S^1$ and $K_{3,3} \times S^1$ families. Additionally, we classify all critical complexes for $S^3$ that decompose as $(G \times S^1) \cup H$, where $G$ and $H$ are graphs whose intersection $G \cap H$ consists solely of vertices of $H$.
  Nevertheless, some complexes cannot be embedded in $S^3$ and yet do not contain any critical subcomplex. Motivated by such examples, we define an equivalence relation on the set of simplicial complexes $\mathcal{C}$, leading to a partially ordered set $(\mathcal{C}/\mathord\sim; \subseteqq)$, and refine the definition of critical. According to the refined definition of criticality, we prove that if a 2-dimensional complex $X$ cannot be embedded in $S^3$, then there exists $[X']\subseteqq [X]$ such that $[X']$ is critical for $[S^3]$.</description>

      <title>Glauber dynamics for the hard-core model on bounded-degree $H$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hard-core model has as its configurations the independent sets of some graph instance $G$. The probability distribution on independent sets is controlled by a `fugacity' $\lambda&gt;0$, with higher $\lambda$ leading to denser configurations. We investigate the mixing time of Glauber (single-site) dynamics for the hard-core model on restricted classes of bounded-degree graphs in which a particular graph $H$ is excluded as an induced subgraph. If $H$ is a subdivided claw then, for all $\lambda$, the mixing time is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. This extends a result of Chen and Gu for claw-free graphs. When $H$ is a path, the set of possible instances is finite. For all other $H$, the mixing time is exponential in $n$ for sufficiently large $\lambda$, depending on $H$ and the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>Generalised hook lengths and Schur elements for Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two generalisations of the notion of hook lengths for partitions. We apply this in the context of the modular representation theory of Ariki-Koike algebras. We show that the Schur element of a simple module is divisible by the Schur element of the associated (generalised) core. In the case of Hecke algebras of type $A$, we obtain an even stronger result: the Schur element of a simple module is equal to the product of the Schur element of its core and the Schur element of its quotient.</description>

      <title>Realizations of homology classes and projection areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Limits of Sandpiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>
