      <title>Threshold Switching in Vertically Aligned MoS${_2}$/SiO${_x}$ Heterostructures based on Silver Ion Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold switching (TS) is a phenomenon where non-permanent changes in electrical resistance of a two-terminal device can be controlled by modulating the voltage bias. TS based on silver (Ag) conductive filaments has been observed in many materials, including layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 2D TMDs are particularly promising for metal ion movement due to their van der Waals (vdW) gaps between their sheets, facilitating ion migration and filament formation without disturbing covalent chemical bonds. In this work, we demonstrate the heterostructure growth of vertically aligned molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) with an amorphous silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$) layer on top after sulfurization. We show that Ag ions migrate through this material stack, enabling TS. Our Ag/SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$/gold (Au) devices exhibit TS at low voltages of ~0.63 V, with high on-state currents over 200 ${\mu}$A and stable switching exceeding 10${^4}$ cycles. Moreover, we identify two rate-limiting steps for filament formation through a physics-based dynamical model and simulate the switching kinetics. Our devices show a fast on-switching time of 311 ns and spontaneous relaxation in 233 ns. These findings deepen the understanding of SiOx/MoS${_2}$-based RS devices and demonstrate the promise for applications in emerging memories and neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Cracking in polymer substrates for flexible devices and its mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical reliability plays an outsized role in determining the durability of flexible electronic devices because of the significant mechanical stresses they can experience during manufacturing and operation. These devices are typically built on sheets comprising stiff thin-film electrodes on compliant polymer substrates, and it is generally assumed that the high-toughness substrates do not crack easily. Contrary to this widespread assumption, here we reveal severe, pervasive, and extensive cracking in the polymer substrates during bending of electrode/substrate sheets, which compromises the overall mechanical integrity of the entire device. The substrate-cracking phenomenon appears to be general, and it is driven by the amplified stress intensity factor caused by the elastic mismatch at the film/substrate interface. To mitigate this substrate cracking, an interlayer-engineering approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated. This approach is generic, and it is potentially applicable to myriad flexible electronic devices that utilize stiff films on compliant substrates, for improving their durability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Interface Magnetism in Vanadium-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in two-dimensional materials is of great importance in discovering new physical phenomena and developing new devices at the nanoscale. In this paper, first-principles simulations are used to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of heterostructures composed of Graphene and MoS$_2$ considering the influence of point defects and Vanadium doping. It is found that the concentration of the dopants and the types of defects can result in induced magnetic moments leading to ferromagnetically polarized systems with sharp interfaces. This provides a framework for interpreting the experimental observations of enhanced ferromagnetism in both MoS$_2$/Graphene and V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures. The computed electronic and spin polarizations give a microscopic understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in these systems and illustrate how doping and defect engineering can lead to targeted property tunability. Our work has demonstrated that through defects engineering, ferromagnetism can be achieved in V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures, providing a potential way to induce magnetization in other TMDC/Graphene materials and opening new opportunities for their applications in nano-spintronics.</description>

      <title>A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen-doped GNRs (O-doped chevron-GNR and O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O-doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron-GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)-GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2-hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stress in Two-phase Random Materials and Super-Resolution Method for Stress Images by Embedding Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Structural transformation for BaBiO3-{\delta} thin films grown on SrTiO3-buffered Si(001) induced by an in-situ Molecular Beam Epitaxy cooldown process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen loss is one of the common defect types in perovskite oxides whose formation can be caused by a low oxygen background pressure during growth or by straining the thin film. Crystalline BaBiO3-{\delta} thin films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3 buffered Si(001) substrates. Adsorption-controlled regime governs the epitaxy, as the sticking coefficient of bismuth is boosted by supplying activated oxygen at plasma power of 600 W during epitaxy. Even though activated oxygen is supplied during the growth process, large amount of oxygen vacancies is found to be created in the thin film depending on the cooldown process. Perovskite structure is obtained when the cooldown process includes an extended period of time during which activated oxygen at plasma power of 600 W is supplied. Another way for inducing the structural transformation is enabled via an ex-situ 600{\deg}C anneal step at molecular oxygen for the sample which includes oxygen vacancy channels. The transformation into perovskite structure BaBiO3 is manifested as reconstructed octahedra based on transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence. Additionally, smaller out-of-plane lattice constant as well as increased monoclinicity are observed for the perovskite phase supported by X-ray diffraction data. In this paper, thermal mismatch and multivalency-facilitated tensile strain exerted on the layers by the underlying Si substrates are presented as the driving force behind the creation of oxygen vacancies.</description>

      <title>In Situ Nanometer-Resolution Strain and Orientation Mapping for Gas-Solid Reactions via Precession-Assisted Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemomechanical interactions in gas or liquid environments are crucial for the functionality and longevity of various materials used in sustainable energy technologies, such as rechargeable batteries, water-splitting catalysts, and next-generation nuclear reactors. A comprehensive understanding of nanoscale strain evolution involved in these processes can advance our knowledge of underlying mechanisms and facilitate material design improvements. However, traditional microscopy workflows face challenges due to trade-offs between field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and electron beam damage, particularly in gas or liquid environments. Here, we demonstrate in situ nanometer-resolution strain and orientation mapping in a temperature-controlled gas environment with a large FOV. This is achieved by integrating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based closed-cell TEM holder, precession-assisted four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), and a direct electron detector (DED). Using the strain evolution during zirconium initial oxidation as a case study, we first outline critical strategies for focused ion beam gas-cell sample preparation and gas-phase TEM workflows to enhance experimental success. We then show that integrating DED with precession electron diffraction and optimizing gas pressure substantially improve the quantity and quality of the detected Bragg peaks in nano-beam electron diffraction patterns, enabling more precise strain measurements. Furthermore, we introduce a practical protocol to pause the reactions, allowing sufficient time for 4D-STEM data collection while ensuring the temporal resolution needed to resolve material dynamics. Our methodology and workflow provide a robust framework for quantitative analysis of chemomechanical evolutions in materials exposed to gas or liquid environments.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-dependent decay of room temperature metastable skyrmions and a nascent double-$q$ spin texture in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral cubic Co-Zn-Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room-temperature skyrmion phases and robust far-from-equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$ is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double-$q$ spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors $q$, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple-$q$ hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double-$q$ texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Conglomeratic Nature of Methanol Clusters Adsorbed on Graphene Surfaces. Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expression of chirality in adsorption phenomena constitutes an important topic, not only relevant to asymmetric transformations involving solid surfaces, but also to the emergence of homochirality in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial scenarios. Methanol (MeOH) aggregation on graphite/graphene, one of the most idealized adsorbate-adsorbent systems, lead to islands of cyclic clusters of different sizes (Nano. Lett., 2016, 16, 3142-3147). Here, we show that this aggregation occurs enantioselectively affording 2D conglomerates depending on the size of clusters, in close analogy to a Pasteurian racemate. Homochiral sequences are held together by hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions, whose absolute configurations can be appropriately specified. A discussion involving the dichotomy between 2D racemates and conglomerates, is offered as well. In addition, the present simulations showcase a broad range of acyclic and cyclic structures, even if some discrete rings are the dominant species, in agreement with previous experimental data and theoretical modeling. Our results indicate that MeOH clusters show binding energies close to the experimental values, remaining intact at temperatures as high as 120 K and up to 150 K.</description>

      <title>A Workflow for Correlative in-situ Nano-chip Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography Enabled by Cryogenic Plasma Focused Ion Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operando/in-situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) allows for real time imaging of dynamic nanoscale liquid-based processes. However, due to the thick liquid cell of traditional LCTEM holders and thus scattering of the electron beam passing through the cell, the achievable spatial and chemical resolution is limited. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) overcomes these limitations by offering (near-)atomic scale compositional analysis of frozen liquid-solid interfaces. However, APT provides limited structural analysis and has no capacity for dynamic or operando liquid cell studies. This work presents a novel workflow for site-specific cryo-APT sample preparation of liquid-solid interfaces from in-situ electrochemical LCTEM Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) chips. Using cryogenic inert gas transfer suitcase and a cryogenic plasma-focused ion beam (PFIB), a MEMs nanochip containing a Li electrolyte from an electrochemistry LCTEM holder was successfully frozen, transferred to the cryo stage of a PFIB and prepared into APT needle samples containing the electrolyte-electrode interface at cryogenic temperatures, followed by cryogenic transfer to an atom probe for nanoscale compositional analysis. This correlative approach provides dynamic nanoscale imaging and near atomic scale compositional analysis of liquid-solid interfaces. This method enables reliable and reproducible APT sample preparation of these frozen interfaces from MEMs based nanochips and can hence be used across materials systems and energy-conversion or storage devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Conventional Characterization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we uncover structural heterogeneity by single-crystal X-ray diffraction that eludes the common characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtain diverse stoichiometries and structures, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\leq\textrm{x}\leq1$. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we identify four new structures: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{1.92}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.37}$TaSe$_{2.14}$ ($R\bar3$), Sn$_{0.42}$TaSe$_{2.04}$ ($P\bar31c$), and Sn$_{1.1}$TaSe$_2$ ($Fmm2$). In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction cannot resolve all four structures. Raman spectroscopy is unable to distinguish different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Transport measurements show consistent superconductivity irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount or appearance of charge density wave behavior. This work underscores the inadequate sensitivity of common approaches in capturing the structural diversity of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides and the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</description>

While skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric materials are known to be stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction (DMI), their deliberate design in centrosymmetric materials remains a challenge. This difficulty largely stems from the complexity of controlling magnetocrystalline anisotropy $-$ a critical factor in the absence of DMI. Here, we demonstrate the chemical tuning of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the centrosymmetric Kagome magnet TmMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The resulting compound exhibits a spin reorientation transition accompanied by an emergent skyrmion bubble lattice, confirmed by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Our findings overcome a key materials design challenge and open possibilities for deliberate design of skyrmionic textures in centrosymmetric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons conventionally carry an angular momentum and a magnetic moment arising from the circular motions of the atoms around their equilibrium positions in a crystal. Here, we present three cases of anomalous magnetic moments produced by axial phonons that cannot be described in the conventional framework. The three cases include rotationless axial phonons, in which the atoms carry no real, but only pseudo, angular momentum and magnetic moments, diverging gyromagnetic ratios, in which a finite phonon magnetic moment is produced despite nearly vanishing phonon angular momentum, and noncollinear phonon magnetic moments, in which the angular momentum and magnetic moment of the axial phonon are not parallel. Our results shine light on the origin and nature of phonon magnetic moments and open a route towards phononic hidden orders and noncollinear phonomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Catalyst-mediated etching of carbon nanotubes exhibiting electronic-structure insensitivity and reciprocal kinetics with growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective etching of carbon nanotubes has been widely explored as a post-synthetic route for enriching semiconducting species. As nanoelectronic applications increasingly demand pure semiconducting nanotubes for use in field-effect transistors and other optoelectronic devices, understanding the mechanistic basis of selective removal becomes critical. While etching selectivity is often attributed to electronic structure effects on tube walls, its relevance in the presence of catalyst nanoparticles remains unclear. Here, we directly quantify the catalyst-mediated etching and growth rates of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes using elaborate isotope labeling methods. Surprisingly, in water vapor and methanol environments, catalytic etching proceeds with negligible dependence on tube electronic type, in sharp contrast to non-catalytic oxidation pathways. In-situ Raman analysis upon heating on nanotube ensembles also confirms metallicity-insensitive etching under catalytic conditions, whereas sidewall oxidation without catalysts exhibits pronounced selectivity. Our growth kinetic model, which precisely describes the kinetics of catalytic etching process, motivates kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of nanotube edge dynamics, revealing the reciprocal nature of edge configuration during growth and etching. These findings highlight a fundamental mechanistic distinction between catalytic and non-catalytic reactivity and thus propose that catalytic etching may serve as a diagnostic mirror of growth behavior when using pre-sorted carbon nanotube samples.</description>

      <title>Ab initio molecular dynamics of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using disordered local moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an investigation of the thermophysical properties of paramagnetic uranium mononitride (UN) using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) approach. This methodology accurately captures the high-temperature paramagnetic state of UN, addressing the limitations of standard density functional theory (DFT) models. The AIMD+DLM model consistently predicts a cubic crystal structure for UN across all considered temperatures, aligning with experimental observations of its paramagnetic phase. Key thermophysical properties, including the lattice parameter and specific heat capacity, are computed and compared to experimental data. The calculated lattice parameter is somewhat underestimated relative to the empirical correlation, consistent with prior studies modeling UN as a ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) material. The specific heat capacity exhibits overestimation at low temperatures (300--500 K) and slight underestimation at higher temperatures, while closely following the experimental trend. These results highlight the accuracy and utility of the AIMD+DLM framework in modeling paramagnetic materials, which can offer insights into the influence of the magnetic state on the behavior of nuclear fuels at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Modified Ex Situ Tomography Data for Segmentation of In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>In situ measurement of electrical resistivity evolution during dynamic compression of copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel experimental methodology for in situ measurement of electrical resistivity changes in T2 copper during dynamic compression utilizing a split Hopkinson pressure bar. The effects of adiabatic temperature rise and specimen shape deformation on the resistance were carefully accounted, which allowed one to isolate the contribution of microstructure changes such as dislocation evolution, defect generation, and lattice distortion. The latter allows for a real-time relationship between strain and electrical resistivity to be tracked. The experimental findings are also supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations that provide details about the process of microstructure evolution under dynamic loading. Up to now, very few in situ measurements has been carried out for changes in electrical resistivity during dynamic deformation, thus establishing a direct link for resistivity-strain which has important implications toward the understanding of plastic deformation and industrial application guidance.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ adsorption and photocatalytic reduction mechanisms on Ti-terminated CaTiO$_3$ (100) surface: a DFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoreduction of CO$_2$ is an important alternative approach aimed to reduce the CO$_2$ atmospheric content which is responsible of the global warming. The development of an efficient photocatalyst can strongly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the by-products of such a process. Recently, CaTiO$_3$ has been used as an alternative semiconductor catalyst due to its attractive properties. In this study, we use calculations of the electronic structure of first principles to investigate for the first time the general reaction mechanism that leads to the main value-added by-products of HCOOH, CO, H$_3$COH and CH$_4$ byproducts, focusing on the reactions of adsorption, activation and reduction reactions of CO$_2$ molecules on the Ti-terminated CaTiO$_3$ (100) surface. We compute adsorption energies of the various intermediate configurations and activation energy barriers of the chemical reaction pathways.
  Our results show that CO$_2$ can be activated by charge transfer of excess electrons leading to a CO$_2$ anion that probably gives HCOO by the first reduction; however, the second hydrogenation to HCOOH is impeded by the prohibitive energy barrier. In particular, activated CO$_2$ can also easily undergo decomposition, which facilitates CO production. Afterwards, we discuss the possible reaction mechanisms of CO photoreduction towards H$_3$COH and CH$_4$ value-added products, taking into account the experimental evidence that only CO and CH$_4$ have been detected. The reaction pathway generally follows the most energetically convenient routes characterized by activated intermediates. Even though H$_3$COH could be finally produced, its strong adsorption ($E_{ads}$ of -0.93 eV) and its promoted decomposition to H$_3$CO+H on the surface could explain why it has not been detected, as opposed to CH$_4$ whose $E_{ads}$ is only -0.22 eV due to its non-polar nature.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Role of Transition Metals and Polyanionic Frameworks in Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing research in the area of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), providing more affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. Polyanionic compounds have emerged as promising options due to their stable structure and ability to withstand high-voltage conditions as well as fast charging capabilities. This review offers a thorough discussion of phosphate-based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs, exploring their structure, electrochemical performance with various transition metals, and existing challenges. We discuss different polyanionic frameworks, such as ortho-phosphates, fluoro-phosphates, pyro-phosphates, mix pyro-phosphates, and NASICON-based phosphates, highlighting their unique structural characteristics and ability to perform well across a wide potential range. Further, we delve into the mechanisms governing sodium storage and tunability of redox potentials in polyanionic materials, providing insights into the factors that affect their electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential avenues for the practical applications of polyanionic high-voltage cathodes in sodium-ion battery technologies.</description>

      <title>Inverse Sandwich Geometry and Stability of B$_7$Y$_2$ Clusters: A DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structural and electronic properties of B$_7$Y$_2$ clusters -- boron frameworks doped with two yttrium atoms. Our results show that the most stable configuration adopts an inverse sandwich geometry, while higher-energy isomers ($\sim$1.45 eV above) exhibit B$_7$ wheel-like motifs with yttrium at top or bridge sites. To understand the bonding and stability, we analyze the electron localization function (ELF) and localized orbital locator (LOL) maps. The global minimum shows a symmetric, delocalized electron distribution, strong B-B covalent bonding, and partial charge transfer from Y atoms. In contrast, higher-energy isomers show less effective Y-B interactions. ELF and LOL analyses confirm electron delocalization within the boron framework. Mulliken population analysis reveals significant metal-to-boron charge transfer, contributing to the stability of the inverse sandwich structure through synergistic effects of delocalized bonding and charge redistribution.</description>

      <title>Predicting neutron experiments from first principles: A workflow powered by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4{\deg}C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cavities in BCC-Fe with coexisting H and He under fusion environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.</description>

      <title>Thermodiffusion mechanism for the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metal melt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical model of the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metallic melt is proposed. It has been shown that the appearance of a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt leads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume, which manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces for the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion process, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium occurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the mechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature distribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt have been carried out.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Dual-Switchable Ferroelectric Altermagnets: Altering Electrons and Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAMs) offer unique magnetoelectric coupling properties by combining the characteristics of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, yet their multifunctional electric control remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous electrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in two-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$ and V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises from asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the $xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric polarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining [C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing the ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic spin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as dual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and magnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the magneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a materials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel electrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>A Universal Spin-Orbit-Coupled Hamiltonian Model for Accelerated Quantum Material Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and Li-diffusion in the 1/3-filled Kagome layers of antiperovskite Lithium-ion battery materials (Li$_2$Fe)SO and (Li$_2$Fe)SeO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered lithium-rich antiperovskites (Li$_2$Fe)SeO and (Li$_2$Fe)SO host lithium and iron ions on the same atomic position which octahedrally coordinates to central oxygens. In a cubic antiperovskite these sites form Kagome planes stacked along the &lt;111&gt; directions which triangular motifs induce high geometric frustration in the diluted magnetic sublattice for antiferromagnetic interactions. Despite their compelling properties as high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the electronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report static magnetization, M\"ossbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data reveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic correlations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe distribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is observed above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our data elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and presumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Multiplet Excitations probed by the $M_{5,4}$ Branching Ratio in $3d \rightarrow 4f$ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that ultrafast electronic $4f$ multiplet transitions in terbium metal are manifested by changes in the relative spectral weight of the $M_5$ and $M_4$ X-ray absorption resonances. Our experimental results are supported by a simulation of excited multiplet spectra with atomistic calculations; they prove that the so-called third rule of Thole and van der Laan, which relates the branching ratio of the spin-orbit split resonances to the total angular momentum $J$ of the excited ion, is also valid in non-equilibrium. The presented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation, \textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without net magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric and Hyper Dielectric modes in Ferronematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported non-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000 and superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching studies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of WJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a working media for supercapacitors industry.</description>

      <title>Exploring binary intermetallics for advanced interconnect applications using ab initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of increasing copper (Cu) resistivity with diminishing Cu interconnect dimensions in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, along with the imperative for efficient electron transport paths to fulfill scaling requirements in interconnects is significant. First-principles electronic structures calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to evaluate the potential scalability of some Cu, Al, Ru and Mo based binary alloys to replace Cu. We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.</description>

      <title>The charge cycle of group IV vacancy centers in diamond: From DFT to rate equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.</description>

      <title>Bio-Derived Graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium Leaves for rGO-MoO$_3$ Nanocomposites with Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning-guided design of Fe-based soft magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1. Our fundings demonstrate the potential of ML framework for accelerated search of high-performance, Co- and Ni-free, soft magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Stainless steel in an electronically excited state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) is modeled with the XTANT-3 simulation toolkit to evaluate its properties in an electronically excited state produced by ultrafast laser irradiation. The model relies on density-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian, producing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to calculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000 K. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond timescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature $T_e \sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the interatomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without electron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the electron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage threshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond timescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaBiO3 has lately gained high research attention as a parent material for an interesting family of alloyed compositions with multiple technological applications. In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition tool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is studied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001) substrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001) and (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the growth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001) are described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of the co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be beneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3 material family in a more controlled manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic generation (SHG) are highly sought in today's technology. However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.</description>

Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450{\deg}C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400{\deg}C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Emission Polarization of GaN Defect Quantum Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters are promising candidates for quantum information technologies, although their underlying nature remains elusive. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms responsible for this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations from the hexagonal spin clusters in the S = 1/2 distorted honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.</description>

      <title>Higgs-mode electromagnon in the spin-spiral multiferroic CuBr${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Fermi Surface, Van Hove Singularity and Enhancement of Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface with a clear $k_z$ dispersion in infinite-layer nickelates, distinguishing them from their cuprate superconductor counterparts. However, the impact of this difference on the superconducting properties of nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ a combined random-phase-approximation and dynamical-mean-field-theory (RPA+DMFT) approach to solve the linearized gap equation for superconductivity. We find that, compared to the cuprate-like two-dimensional (2D) single-orbital Fermi surface, the van Hove singularities on the 3D Fermi surface of infinite-layer nickelates strengthen spin fluctuations by driving the system closer to antiferromagnetic instabilities, thereby significantly enhancing superconductivity. Our findings underscore the critical role of the van Hove singularities in shaping the superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelates and, more broadly, highlight the importance of subtle Fermi surface features in modeling material-specific unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Reshaping MOFs Text Mining with a Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework of Large Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF synthesis of all researchers.</description>

      <title>Sparks: Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence Model Discovers Protein Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.</description>

      <title>$X$-type electrides hosting skin-like interstitial electron states and doping-enhanced superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Compatible-Strain Mixed Finite Elements for 2D Compressible Nonlinear Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a new class of mixed finite elements -- compatible-strain mixed finite elements (CSMFEs) -- has emerged that uses the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity. Their excellent performance in benchmark problems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in near-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving engineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of first-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape functions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order CSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress tensor. Concepts of vector calculus that stem from exterior calculus are presented and used to provide efficient forms for shape functions in the natural coordinate system. Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations are then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space. Mid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for the displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements. The formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects regarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark problems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order CSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration. It is shown that the proposed CSMFEs are numerically stable for modeling near-incompressible solids in the finite strain regime.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Conventional and Spin-Exchange Auger Recombination in Magnetically Doped Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auger processes play a critical role in the behavior of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key performance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also present exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging optoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that incorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast spin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination and related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger recombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and Mn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger recombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic alignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip transition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy being approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip transition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates multiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on ultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than conventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by the occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size or the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination coexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their timescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish that SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it uniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and opening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large atomic models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to April 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and an interactive leaderboard is available at https://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.</description>

      <title>Orbital enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect for probing topological phase transition in CuTlSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect proposed in recent studies offers a new way to probe intrinsic band geometric properties in a large class of materials. However, the search of material platforms with a large response remains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show that the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response coefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the Weyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these features for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported two different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference originates from two slightly different structures with different lattice parameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in the Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large response is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points. Our work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and topological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for realizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary complexion transitions in olivine with temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Superconductivity by Fully Compensated Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and N\'eel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall Single-crystal Gold Nanoelectrodes towards Advanced Chemical Probing and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-wall metal ultramicro- and nanoelectrodes (UMEs/NEs), especially gold NEs, are indispensable for high-resolution electrochemical microscopy, biosensing, and fundamental research. However, their damage susceptibility and the lack of scalable fabrication methods hinder broader adoption. We present a versatile wet-chemical approach for high-throughput fabrication of thin-wall Au NEs/UMEs and multifunctional NEs with ~80% reproducibility. This method is based on a unique template-assisted 1D growth of single-crystalline Au in borosilicate nanopipettes followed by electrochemical contacting with tungsten microwires, and focused ion beam milling, ensuring precise control over NEs dimensions. Adaptable to various metals and integrable in multifunctional probes, the method facilitates batch production of high-quality NEs with standardized electrical connections. Structural and electrochemical characterization reveals a twinned single-crystalline Au core, a seamless Au/glass interface, and highly stable electrochemical performance. Notably, smaller electrodes exhibit higher current densities, enhancing chemical detection sensitivity. Specifically, we demonstrate outstanding spatial (&lt; 200 nm) and current (&lt; 1 pA) resolutions, low limit of detection (~11.0 {\mu}M) and high stability (7 h) in scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM), by detecting photo-oxidation reaction on atomically smooth Au micro-flakes. We also demonstrate growth in double-barrel pipettes for SECM/SICM probes as well as Pt NEs. Overall, this scalable method addresses longstanding challenges in NEs, paving the way for advanced electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical microscopy, including SERS/TERS integration. With single-crystalline surfaces, these electrodes open new frontiers in catalysis, interfacial electrochemistry, biosensing, and molecular-scale investigations.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</description>

      <title>Damage Localisation in Fresh Cement Mortar Observed via In Situ (Timelapse) X-ray {\mu}CT imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.</description>

Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</description>

      <title>Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</description>

      <title>Insulating Half-Heusler TmPdSb with Unusual Band Order and Metallic Surface States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results exploring a half-Heusler compound TmPdSb with unusual band order and metallic surface states. Typically, the half-Heusler systems exhibit topological features in a semimetallic state, and trivial ones in an insulating state. Topological properties of the most of half-Heusler systems are related to the band inversion around the Fermi level, similar to this observed in CdTe/HgTe systems. In the case of TmPdSb we observed the gapped electronic band structure with ``band inversion'' in the conductance band, while the slab-like system realized metallic surface states. The bulk insulating nature of the compound was corroborated by means of electrical transport measurements. The experimental data revealed several features due to the presence of metallic surface states, such as linear magnetoresistance and weak-antilocalization effect, characterized by enhanced coherence length and a very large number of surface conductive channels. Our findings reveal new features of the rare-earth half-Heusler.</description>

Abstract: Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insights into Cu segregation effects on irradiation-induced defect dynamics in medium-entropy alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copper (Cu) segregation in medium and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) has shown significant influence on alloy properties. In this study, we investigate the effect of Cu segregation on evolution of irradiation-induced defects in FeNiCu, a model MEA, using hybrid molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Thermodynamically driven hybrid MC/MD annealing at low temperature resulted in a partially decomposed Cu-segregated structure (CSS) and was compared with a random solid solution (RSS) and pure Ni. Results through cumulative displacement cascades reveal that Cu-rich domains in CSS act as defect traps, accelerating interstitial-vacancy recombination and suppressing defect cluster growth. The complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in CSS disrupts dislocation propagation, leading to spatially dispersed networks. Notably, CSS exhibits reduced stair-rod dislocation density compared to RSS, highlighting its superior resistance to irradiation swelling. Localized shear strain causes dislocations to preferentially nucleate in/near Cu-rich regions though their growth is hindered by chemical heterogeneity of the alloy. Notably, prolonged irradiation induces slow Cu segregation in the RSS structure, while slowly annihilating pre-existing Cu clusters in CSS simultaneously. The findings provide atomic-scale insights into the interplay between Cu segregation and irradiation-induced defect evolution in MEAs.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction.
  The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$
  orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength.
  We relate this to a recent experimental study of
  cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations in extended solids with substitutional disorder using a neural network potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes -&gt;0 at temperature -&gt;0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.</description>

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moir\'e systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moir\'e nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A statistical understanding of oxygen vacancies in distorted high-entropy oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting oxygen vacancy concentrations for the design of HEPOs with high-entropic A-sites remains challenging due to the complex arrangements of metal cations. Our experimental findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute a crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. High-throughput atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential reveal that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Altogether, our results show mixing metal cations of varying sizes in the A-site creates statistical effects on the oxygen vacancy thermodynamics, resulting in a unique approach to tuning their concentrations for complex perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Spintronics in 2D graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spintronics has become a broad and important research field that intersects with magnetism, nano-electronics, and materials science. Its overarching aim is to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility. Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Fully gapped superconductivity and topological aspects of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaReSi"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure. This noncentrosymmetric structure is proposed to be the source of topological properties for mentioned compound. However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful in capturing electrical conductivity under magnetic field, as a function of density and mobility of electron-like and hole-like carriers. However, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field, respectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied a system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field dependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the electron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn can be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework of the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e} \times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a parameter to predict the degree of compensation. Our findings offer crucial insights into identifying empirical conditions for field-induced enhancement of TE performance and into engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near these high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.</description>

      <title>Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The Hall effect analysis in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ reveals both intriguing physical phenomena and methodological challenges. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. At low temperatures, upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE sharply increases and exceeds the conventional limits expected from intrinsic mechanisms. We also demonstrate the limitations of standard experimental methods in extracting the topological contribution to the Hall effect data. We show the importance of considering magnetoresistance anisotropy when estimating the anomalous and topological Hall effects. These shortcomings in current approaches in partitioning the Hall response necessitate new tools to interpret transport results in complex magnetic materials such as LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</description>

      <title>Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</description>
