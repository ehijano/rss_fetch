      <title>(2,2)-GB Codes: Classification and Comparison with weight-4 Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance, we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1 ]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB codes, previously deemed impossible.
  All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code.
  Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4 surface codes.</description>

      <title>Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing (MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Hulls of Group Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be a finite field and $G$ a finte group with $(|G|,q)=1$. By a group code in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$ we mean a two-sided ideal in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$. We will prove a general criterion for the existence of group codes with given hull dimension, and then apply it to deduce explicit criterions for existence of group codes with hull dimension $\leq3$. In particular our criterion for the existence of $1$-dimensional hulls generalizes that of privious work which consider only abelian groups $G$.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Saturation in Two-Timescale RIS-assisted Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pilot-to-Data Power Ratio in RIS-Assisted Multiantenna Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits, demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.</description>

      <title>Properties of Algorithmic Information Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domain-independent universal Normalized Information Distance based on Kolmogorov complexity has been (in approximate form) successfully applied to a variety of difficult clustering problems. In this paper we investigate theoretical properties of the un-normalized algorithmic information distance $d_K$. The main question we are asking in this work is what properties this curious distance has, besides being a metric. We show that many (in)finite-dimensional spaces can(not) be isometrically scale-embedded into the space of finite strings with metric $d_K$. We also show that $d_K$ is not an Euclidean distance, but any finite set of points in Euclidean space can be scale-embedded into $(\{0,1\}^*,d_K)$. A major contribution is the development of the necessary framework and tools for finding more (interesting) properties of $d_K$ in future, and to state several open problems.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Constrained Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Behavioral Hardware Impairments in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink: Centralized Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points (APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining. Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent colored noise.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.</description>

      <title>Double-Target Collaborative Spectrum Sharing for 6G Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Networks with User-Centric Channel Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite and terrestrial cellular networks can be integrated together for extended broadband coverage in e.g., maritime communication scenarios, in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) era. To counter spectrum scarcity, collaborative spectrum sharing is considered for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network (HSTN) in this paper. With only slowly-varying large-scale channel state information (CSI), joint power and channel allocation is implemented for terrestrial mobile terminals (MTs) which share the same frequency band with the satellite MTs opportunistically. Specially, strict quality service assurance is adopted for terrestrial MTs under the constraint of leakage interference to satellite MTs. With the target of maximizing both the number of served terrestrial MTs and the average sum transmission rate, a double-target spectrum sharing problem is formulated. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem efficiently, user-centric channel pools are introduced. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed spectrum sharing scheme could achieve a significant performance gain for the HSTN.</description>

      <title>On Purely Data-Driven Massive MIMO Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of learning-based detectors for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems has been hindered by the inherent complexities arising from the problem's high dimensionality. To enhance scalability, most previous studies have adopted model-driven methodologies that integrate deep neural networks (DNNs) within existing iterative detection frameworks. However, these methods often lack flexibility and involve substantial computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce ChannelNet, a purely data-driven learning-based massive MIMO detector that overcomes these limitations. ChannelNet exploits the inherent symmetry of MIMO systems by incorporating channel-embedded layers and antenna-wise shared feature processors. These modules maintain equivariance to antenna permutations and enable ChannelNet to scale efficiently to large numbers of antennas and high modulation orders with low computational complexity, specifically $\mathcal{O}(N_t N_r)$, where $N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Theoretically, ChannelNet can approximate any continuous permutation-symmetric function and the optimal maximum likelihood detection (ML) function with arbitrary precision under any continuous channel distribution. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ChannelNet consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art detectors across different numbers of antennas, modulation schemes, and channel distributions, all while significantly reducing computational overhead. This study highlights the potential of purely data-driven designs in advancing efficient and scalable detectors for massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Energy Saving in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC for Ultra-Reliable Target-Aware Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable target-aware actuation-where timely and accurate sensing information is used to trigger critical actions in emerging 6G sensing-based applications-demands tight integration of sensing and communication under stringent reliability and latency constraints. This paper investigates integrated sensing and communication(ISAC)in a downlink CF-mMIMO system supporting multi-static sensing and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). We propose a joint power and blocklength allocation algorithm to minimize the E2E energy consumption while meeting communication and sensing requirements.E2E energy consumption includes transmission, sensing receivers, and processing for both sensing and communication. The non-convex optimization problem is solved using a combination of FPP-SCA, concave-convex programming (CCP), and fractional programming techniques. We consider two types of target detectors:clutter-aware and clutter-unaware, each with distinct complexity and performance trade-offs.A computational complexity analysis based on giga-operations per second (GOPS) is conducted to quantify the processing requirements of communication and sensing tasks. We perform a comprehensive performance evaluation under various communication and sensing requirements, and benchmark our approach against two alternatives: one minimizing only transmission energy for ISAC and one minimizing E2E energy only for URLLC without sensing integration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced detection capability with less E2E energy consumption. Additionally, we examine the trade-offs between detector complexity, the number of antenna elements per access point(AP), and the number of sensing APs. Clutter-aware detectors, although more complex, require fewer antennas and sensing receive APs to meet detection requirements, thus yielding up to 40% energy savings.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings \((a, b, c)\), there exists a string \(z\) such that each conditional Kolmogorov complexity \(C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)\) is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We provide a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple \((a, b, c)\) for which no such string \(z\) exists. Moreover, we provide a fully explicit example of such a tuple. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on recent bounds for point-line incidences over prime fields, obtained using tools from additive combinatorics and algebraic methods, notably results by Bourgain--Katz--Tao and Stevens--De Zeeuw. As an application, we show that this impossibility yields lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in information-theoretic behavior between fields with and without proper subfields.</description>

      <title>A DPI-PAC-Bayesian Framework for Generalization Bounds</title>

Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>

      <title>Overview of 3GPP Release 19 Study on Channel Modeling Enhancements to TR 38.901 for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19266</link>

Abstract: Channel models are a fundamental component of wireless communication systems, providing critical insights into the physics of radio wave propagation. As wireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and standardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development, evaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to develop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1 GHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave bands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency range, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved a Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several enhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a Suburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models, variability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per cluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all polarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS) effects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper presents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying rationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and enhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models.</description>

      <title>SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</description>
