      <title>Chiral and deconfinement properties of the QCD crossover have a different volume and baryochemical potential dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossover from hadronic to quark matter is understood to be both a deconfinement as well as a chiral symmetry restoring transition. Here, we study observables related to both aspects using lattice simulations: the Polyakov loop and its derivatives and the chiral condensate and its derivatives. At zero baryochemical potential, and infinite volume, the chiral and deconfinement crossover temperatures almost agree. However, chiral and deconfinement related observables have a qualitatively different chemical potential and volume dependence. In general, deconfinement related observables have a milder volume dependence. Furthermore, while the deconfinement transition appears to get broader with increasing $\mu_B$, the width as well as the strength of the chiral transition is approximately constant. Our results are based on simulations at zero and imaginary chemical potentials using 4stout-improved staggered fermions with $N_\tau=12$ time-slices and physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Block Encodings of Discrete Subgroups on Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a block encoding method for mapping discrete subgroups to qubits on a quantum computer. This method is applicable to general discrete groups, including crystal-like subgroups such as $\mathbb{BI}$ of $SU(2)$ and $\mathbb{V}$ of $SU(3)$. We detail the construction of primitive gates -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier gate -- utilizing this encoding method for $\mathbb{BT}$ and for the first time $\mathbb{BI}$ group. We also provide resource estimations to extract the gluon viscosity. The inversion gates for $\mathbb{BT}$ and $\mathbb{BI}$ are benchmarked on the $\texttt{Baiwang}$ quantum computer with estimated fidelities of $40^{+5}_{-4}\%$ and $4^{+5}_{-3}\%$ respectively.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzy Onion: An Initial Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous contribution, we introduced a matrix formulation of a three-dimensional quantum space named the fuzzy onion. The novel part of the construction is the radial derivative term, which has been defined to recover the correct continuum limit. Here, we describe a numerical simulation of the scalar field theory in this space and test some physical properties of the model with emphasis on the interaction between neighbouring layers.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a $3D$ square lattice, whose domain-wall is a $2D$ sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roy-equation analyses on lattice data of $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$MeV reveals that the lowest $f_0$ meson becomes a bound state under this condition. In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry [X.-H. Cao et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 034009 (2023)]. We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Finally, we also briefly discuss the problems of the effective potential in the situation when $m_\pi$ and temperature get large.</description>
