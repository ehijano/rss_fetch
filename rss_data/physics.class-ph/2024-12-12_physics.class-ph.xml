      <title>A few paradoxes of Gauss' law and how to avoid them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a few charge distributions for which the application of Gauss' law in its integral form, as typically outlined in standard textbooks, results in a contradiction. We identify the root cause of such contradictions and put forward a solution to resolve them.</description>

      <title>On-demand Quick Metasurface Design with Neighborhood Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are reshaping traditional optical paradigms and are increasingly required in complex applications that demand substantial computational resources to numerically solve Maxwell's equations-particularly for large-scale systems, inhomogeneous media, and densely packed metadevices. Conventional forward design using electromagnetic solvers is based on specific approximations, which may not effectively address complex problems. In contrast, existing inverse design methods are a stepwise process that is often time-consuming and involves repetitive computations. Here, we present an inverse design approach utilizing a surrogate Neighborhood Attention Transformer, MetaE-former, to predict the performance of metasurfaces with ultrafast speed and high accuracy. This method achieves global solutions for hundreds of nanostructures simultaneously, providing up to a 250,000-fold speedup compared with solving for individual meta-atoms based on the FDTD method. As examples, we demonstrate a binarized high-numerical-aperture (about 1.31) metalens and several optimized structured-light meta-generators. Our method significantly improves the beam shaping adaptability with metasurfaces and paves the way for fast designing of large-scale metadevices for shaping extreme light fields with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Coherent frequency combs from electrons colliding with a laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly coherent and powerful light sources capable of generating frequency combs in the soft x-ray domain are essential for advancing high precision measurements and conducting rigorous tests of fundamental physics. In this work, we derive the analytical conditions required for the emission of coherent radiation, including coherent frequency combs, from an electron beam colliding with a laser pulse, modeled as a plane wave. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scheme can produce a coherent soft x-ray frequency comb, provided the electron beam is sufficiently monoenergetic and electrons in the beam are regularly spaced. Furthermore, we highlight the advantageous role of employing few-cycle laser pulses in relaxing the stringent monoenergeticity requirements for coherent emission. The conditions derived here can also be used to optimize coherent emission from electron beam-laser interactions in other frequency ranges, such as the terahertz domain.</description>
