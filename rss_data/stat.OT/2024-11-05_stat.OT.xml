      <title>Centrality in Collaboration: A Novel Algorithm for Social Partitioning Gradients in Community Detection for Multiple Oncology Clinical Trial Enrollments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patients at a comprehensive cancer center who do not achieve cure or remission following standard treatments often become candidates for clinical trials. Patients who participate in a clinical trial may be suitable for other studies. A key factor influencing patient enrollment in subsequent clinical trials is the structured collaboration between oncologists and most responsible physicians. Possible identification of these collaboration networks can be achieved through the analysis of patient movements between clinical trial intervention types with social network analysis and community detection algorithms. In the detection of oncologist working groups, the present study evaluates three community detection algorithms: Girvan-Newman, Louvain and an algorithm developed by the author. Girvan-Newman identifies each intervention as their own community, while Louvain groups interventions in a manner that is difficult to interpret. In contrast, the author's algorithm groups interventions in a way that is both intuitive and informative, with a gradient effect that is particularly useful for epidemiological research. This lays the groundwork for future subgroup analysis of clustered interventions.</description>
