      <title>Extending the Low-Frequency Limit of Time-Domain Thermoreflectance via Periodic Waveform Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is a powerful technique for characterizing the thermal properties of layered materials. However, its effectiveness at modulation frequencies below 0.1 MHz is hindered by pulse accumulation effects, limiting its ability to accurately measure in-plane thermal conductivities below 6 W/(m K). Here, we present a periodic waveform analysis-based TDTR (PWA-TDTR) method that extends the measurable frequency range down to 50 Hz with minimal modifications to the conventional setup. This advancement greatly enhances measurement sensitivity, enabling accurate measurements of in-plane thermal conductivities as low as 0.2 W/(m K). We validate the technique by measuring polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fused silica, using PWA-TDTR to obtain in-plane thermal diffusivity and conventional TDTR to measure cross-plane thermal effusivity. Together, these allow the extraction of both thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, with results in excellent agreement with literature values. We further demonstrate the versatility of PWA-TDTR through (1) thermal conductivity and heat capacity measurements of thin liquid films and (2) depth-resolved thermal conductivity profiling in lithium niobate crystals, revealing point defect-induced inhomogeneities at depths up to 100 um. By overcoming frequency and sensitivity constraints, PWA-TDTR significantly expands the applicability of TDTR, enabling detailed investigations of thermal transport in materials and conditions that were previously challenging to study.</description>

      <title>High-Precision and Wafer-Scale Transfer Lithography of Commercial Photoresists via Reversible Adhesion for Sustainable Microfabrication on Diverse Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photolithography conventionally requires flat and rigid substrates, limiting its applications in flexible, curved, and transient electronics. Here, we report a breakthrough approach employing a reversibly adhesion-switchable phase-changing polymer to transfer commercial photoresists onto previously inaccessible substrates. It achieves wafer-scale (4-inch) transfer with global registration error below 60 microns and support precise patterning on solvent-sensitive, curved, microtextured or delicate surfaces. Combined with dry etching, we demonstrated high-resolution patterning of quantum dots and organic semiconductors. The process also supports a sustainable dry lift-off for patterning functional materials. The reusability of both the transfer carrier and photoresist introduces a new level of sustainability and scalability, establishing a significant advancement in microfabrication. We additionally fabricated a micro-sized UV-photodetector array directly on a curved glass bottle to demonstrate this unprecedented capability.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation shows that for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 1^(-9) RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Invariance-embedded Machine Learning Sub-grid-scale Stress Models for Meso-scale Hurricane Boundary Layer Flow Simulation I: Model Development and $\textit{a priori}$ Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops invariance-embedded machine learning sub-grid-scale (SGS) stress models admitting turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) backscatter towards more accurate large eddy simulation (LES) of meso-scale turbulent hurricane boundary layer flows. The new machine learning SGS model consists of two parts: a classification model used to distinguish regions with either strong energy cascade or energy backscatter from those with mild TKE transfer and a regression model used to calculate SGS stresses in regions with strong TKE transfer. To ease model implementation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, the Smagorinsky model with a signed coefficient $C_s$, where a positive value indicates energy cascade while a negative one indicates energy backscatter, is employed as the carrier of the machine learning model. To improve its robustness and generality, both physical invariance and geometric invariance features of turbulent flows are embedded into the model input for classification and regression, and the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient is used as the output of the regression model. Different machine-learning methods and input setups have been used to test the classification model's performance. The F1-scores, which measure balanced precision and recall of a model, of the classification models with physical and geometric invariance embedded can be improved by about $17\%$ over those without considering geometric invariance. Regression models based on ensemble neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in predicting the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient, exceeding that of the dynamic Smagorinsky model in $\textit{a priori}$ tests.</description>

      <title>The universality of filamentation-caused challenges of ultrafast laser energy deposition in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in semiconductors is the cornerstone of emerging disruptive technologies holding considerable potential to revolutionize telecommunications, sensors, quantum engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.</description>

      <title>Muon Imaging of Hydrotreatment Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and simulation-based validation of a muon imaging system tailored for potential applications in industrial hydrotreatment towers. The system is built around a two-panel plastic scintillator hodoscope, equipped with silicon photomultipliers and read-out via a CAEN FERS-A5202 acquisition system. The detector was calibrated using a stepwise ``staircase'' method and characterized under open-sky and controlled conditions. We conducted muon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead shielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA framework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With the detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a realistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal variations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and computing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to detect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of exposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural information. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$ from vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain feasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the feasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex industrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for real-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural analysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of quasisymmetric stellarators and their coil sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We augment the `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository' (QUASR) to include vacuum field stellarators with quasihelical symmetry using a globalized optimization workflow. The database now has almost 370,000 quasisaxisymmetry and quasihelically symmetric devices along with coil sets, optimized for a variety of aspect ratios, rotational transforms, and discrete rotational symmetries. This paper outlines a couple of ways to explore and characterize the data set. We plot devices on a near-axis quasisymmetry landscape, revealing close correspondence to this predicted landscape. We also use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it can easily be visualized in two or three dimensions. Principal component analysis also gives a mechanism to compare the new devices here to previously published ones in the literature. We are able to characterize the structure of the data, observe clusters, and visualize the progression of devices in these clusters. The topology of the data is governed by the interplay of the design constraints and valleys of the quasisymmetry objective. These techniques reveal that the data has structure, and that typically one, two or three principal components are sufficient to characterize it. The latest version of QUASR is archived at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10050655 and can be explored online at quasr.flatironinstitute.org.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>
