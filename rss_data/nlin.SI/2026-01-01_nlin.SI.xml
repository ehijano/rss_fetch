      <title>On the symmetry classification of integrable chains in 3D. Darboux-integrable reductions and their higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for identifying and classifying integrable nonlinear equations with three independent variables, one of which is discrete and the other two are continuous. A characteristic property of this class of equations, called Toda-type chains, is that they admit finite-field reductions in the form of open chains with enhanced integrability. The paper results in a theorem stating that all known integrable Toda-type chains admit reductions in the form of an open chain of length three with a family of second-order evolutionary type symmetries. Apparently, this property of Toda-type chains can be used as an effective classification criterion when compiling lists of integrable differential-difference equations in 3D.</description>

      <title>General Zakharov-Shabat equations without Lax operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operators in the Zakharov-Shabat equations of integrable hierarchies are usually defined from the Lax operators. In this article it is shown that the Zakharov-Shabat equations themselves recover the Lax operators under suitable change of independent variables in the case of the KP hierarchy and the modified KP hierarchy (in the matrix formulation).</description>

      <title>Quantum two-dimensional superintegrable systems in flat space: exact-solvability, hidden algebra, polynomial algebra of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short review paper the detailed analysis of six two-dimensional quantum {\it superintegrable} systems in flat space is presented. It includes the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials I-II (the Holt potential), the Fokas-Lagerstrom model, the 3-body Calogero and Wolfes (equivalently, $G_2$ rational, or $I_6$) models, and the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system with integer index $k$. It is shown that all of them are exactly-solvable, thus, confirming the Montreal conjecture (2001); they admit algebraic forms for the Hamiltonian and both integrals (all three can be written as differential operators with polynomial coefficients without a constant term), they have polynomial eigenfunctions with the invariants of the discrete symmetry group of invariance taken as variables, they have hidden (Lie) algebraic structure $g^{(k)}$ with various $k$, and they possess a (finite order) polynomial algebras of integrals. Each model is characterized by infinitely-many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, which form the infinite flag. Each subspace coincides with the finite-dimensional representation space of the algebra $g^{(k)}$ for a certain $k$. In all presented cases the algebra of integrals is a 4-generated $(H, I_1, I_2, I_{12}\equiv[I_1, I_2])$ infinite-dimensional algebra of ordered monomials of degrees 2,3,4,5, which is a subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of the hidden algebra.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Analysis of Root Patterns in the XXX Model with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string hypothesis for Bethe roots represents a cornerstone in the study of quantum integrable systems, providing access to physical quantities such as the ground-state energy and the finite-temperature free energy. While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $\Lambda-\theta$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in 2D and asymptotic symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are a contribution to the proceedings of the school "Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory", held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, from 31st of July to 9th of August 2023. Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\Lambda&lt;0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.</description>

      <title>Bilinear tau forms of quantum Painlev\'e equations and $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations in SUSY gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive bilinear tau forms of the canonically quantized Painlev\'e equations, thereby relating them to those previously obtained from the $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theory partition functions on a general $\Omega$-background. We fully fix the refined Painlev\'e/gauge theory dictionary by formulating the proper equations for the quantum nonautonomous Painlev\'e Hamiltonians. We also describe the symmetry structure of the quantum Painlev\'e tau functions and, as a byproduct of this analysis, obtain the $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations in the nontrivial holonomy sector of the gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz solution for a model of global-range interacting bosons on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems on a one-dimensional lattice are ubiquitous in the study of models exactly-solved by Bethe Ansatz techniques. Here it is shown that including global-range interaction opens scope for Bethe Ansatz solutions that are not constrained to one-dimensional quantum systems. A bosonic model on a square lattice is defined, and the exact Bethe Ansatz solution is provided for open, cylindrical, and toroidal boundary conditions. Generalising the result for an integrable defect leads to a Bethe Ansatz solution that is not expressible in an exact, closed-form manner.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic equations with fifth-order symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the classification of hyperbolic equations. We study a class of equations of the form $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\partial y}=F\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},u\right),$$ where $u(x,y)$ is the unknown function and $x,y$ are independent variables. The classification is based on the requirement for the existence of higher fifth-order symmetries. As a result, a list of four equations with the required conditions was obtained.</description>
