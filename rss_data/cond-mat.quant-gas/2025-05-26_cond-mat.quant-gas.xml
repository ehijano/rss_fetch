      <title>Nonuniversal equation of state for Rabi-coupled bosonic gases: a droplet phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through an effective quantum field theory including zero temperature Gaussian fluctuations we derive analytical and explicit expressions for the equation of state of three-dimensional ultracold Rabi-coupled two-component bosonic gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions. At mean-field level the system presents two ground-states, one symmetric and one non-symmetric or unbalanced. For the symmetric ground state, in the regime where inter-species interactions are weakly attractive and subtly higher than repulsive intra-species, the instability by collapse is avoided by the contribution arising from Gaussian fluctuations, driving thus to formation of a liquidlike phase or droplet phase. This self-bound state is crucially affected by the dependence on the nonuniversal corrections to the interactions, which acts controlling the droplet stability. By tuning the ratio between the inter-species scattering length and the intra-species scattering lengths or the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of self-bound Rabi-coupled droplets with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions is favorable.</description>

      <title>Theory of two-component superfluidity of microcavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation and two-component superfluidity composed of upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritons confined to a two-dimensional microcavity. By studying a modified Hamiltonian which incorporates interactions between both polariton branches, we derive the collective excitation spectrum and express the sound velocity as a function of detuning and Rabi splitting. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between effective masses and exciton-photon fractions in the UP and LP branches can significantly enhance the superfluid properties compared to a one-component condensate of only lower polaritons. Specifically, we discover that larger Rabi splitting increases the sound velocity and raises the critical temperature for superfluidity, while negative and positive detuning further favors a two-component condensate. Additionally, we demonstrate that these trends are consistent and applicable to various materials, including GaAs and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), thereby indicating the potential for high-temperature superfluid phenomena in two-dimensional polariton systems. We hope these findings will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of structures containing multi-component polariton systems and generate experimental realizations of tunable quantum fluids with light.</description>

      <title>Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence and phase transitions in a finite-size one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact numerical diagonalization. The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Fujita-Miyazawa-Type Three-Body Force in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force emerges among three impurity atoms immersed in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. As a result of thermal average over excitations in the medium and impurities as well as expansion with respect to the impurity-medium and Feshbach resonance couplings, two superfluid phonons and a closed channel resonance play a role in producing an effective three-body force, as in the original three-nucleon case in which two pions and a $\Delta$ resonance are involved. The proposed Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force can be enhanced by tuning the closed-channel energy level via an external magnetic field, and moreover, its strength can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the impurity equation of state. Our result gives a new insight into an analogy between atomic polarons and nuclear few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal fixed point for quasi-1D Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal scaling dynamics connected to non-thermal fixed points has been suggested as a universal framework to describe the relaxation of isolated far-from-equilibrium systems. Experimental studies in weakly-interacting cold atom systems have found scaling dynamics connected to specific attractors. In our experiments, we study a quantum gas of strongly interacting $^6$Li$_2$ Feshbach molecules, brought far out of equilibrium by imprinting a white-noise phase profile. The observed relaxation follows the same universal dynamics as for the previously observed formation of the order parameter in a shock-cooled gas of weakly interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our results point to a single universal fixed point with a large basin of attraction governing the relaxation of quasi-1D bosonic systems, independent of their specific initial conditions and microscopic details.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to spin dynamics for quantum mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the next-chapter button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization of Quantum Control with Minimum Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of quantum control from a differential geometric perspective. In our approach, optimal control minimizes the cost associated with evolving a quantum state, with the cost quantified by the length of the trajectory on a relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol in systems with SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamical symmetries, which encompass a broad range of physical systems. In these systems, the time evolution can be represented by trajectories on a three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to a geodesic on the manifold. When the trajectory between the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost control corresponds to a geodesic within a submanifold embedded in the three-dimensional space. This framework provides a geometric method for optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$-plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$-plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>
