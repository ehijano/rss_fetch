      <title>Stability of stationary solutions in Acoustic wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions. In particular, we show that the stability of these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Solvable Models of Heat Transport in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate solvable models of heat transport between a pair of quantum mechanical systems initialized at two different temperatures. At time $t=0$, a weak interaction is switched on between the systems, and we study the resulting energy transport. Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system. We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like models ({\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\it conformal models}) - can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the rich features of DSSYK.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>

      <title>Counting Short Trajectories in Elementary Cellular Automata using the Transfer Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum recurrences and the arithmetic of Floquet dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e recurrence theorem shows that conservative systems in a bounded region of phase space eventually return arbitrarily close to their initial state after a finite amount of time. An analogous behavior occurs in certain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long unitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically driven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics even in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and Hamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies treat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the problem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of finite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable models. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an arithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing the cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This computationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating all candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously ruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove that rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact recurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and long-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of quantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight parameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced turbulence in viscous binary fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of interface-induced turbulence, an emergent nonequilibrium statistically steady state (NESS) with spatiotemporal chaos, which is induced by interfacial fluctuations in low-Reynolds-number binary-fluid mixtures. We uncover the properties of this NESS via direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of cellular flows in the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for binary fluids. We show that, in this NESS, the shell-averaged energy spectrum $E(k)$ is spread over more than one decade in the wavenumber $k$ and it exhibits a power-law region, indicative of turbulence \textit{but without a conventional inertial cascade}. To characterize the statistical properties of this turbulence, we compute, in addition to $E(k)$, the time series $e(t)$ of the kinetic energy and its power spectrum, scale-by-scale energy transfer as a function of $k$, and the energy dissipation resulting from interfacial stresses. Furthermore, we analyze the mixing properties of this low-Reynolds-number turbulence via the mean-square displacement (MSD) of Lagrangian tracer particles, for which we demonstrate diffusive behavior at long times, a hallmark of strong mixing in turbulent flows.</description>
